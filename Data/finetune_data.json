    "captions": "(keyboard cluttering) (gentle music) - Check this out. Disregarding ocean boundaries,\ntesting microchips. The Chinese government released a map. (dramatic music) It's convincing depictions\nof individuals doing or saying things that they never did. - Deep fakes.\n- [Female] Deep fakes. - What is even real? Lee Harvey Oswald, whole\nthing was actually a setup. - [Oswald] I'm just a patsy. - Patsy, which is like an old-timey term for like the fall guy,\nthe one who was set up by the leaders around him. Let's do this.\n- Our service members, have encountered unidentified\naerial phenomena. - On unidentified aerial\nphenomena, UAP, baby. We're exiting a period\nof incredible growth. Look at this graph. (dramatic music) But if you have 1,000 of these switches, suddenly you have something that kind of resembles a little brain. There's actually not a ton of nuance here. But they would be in\nsomething very interesting. (upbeat music) A quiet revolution stirs. - [Male Reporter] The\nBerlin Wall has fallen. - [Johnny] Yeah.\n- Nice. (upbeat music) - And I don't understand why and I want to understand why. All right, let's do this. Check this out. Microchips. It conducts electricity really well. It is a semiconductor of electricity. In the heart of Ukraine,\na quiet revolution stirs. The creation of new tools\nof war built by volunteers and students and technicians. Tinkerers, who are\nrepurposing their skills to resist invasion. And guess what? This happened. - The US does not\ncurrently have the ability to even track this weapon,\nmuch less defeat it. - A Chinese spy balloon\ndrifting across North America. - [Johnny] These two navy\npilots arrive to the scene. The Navy report describes this object as, \"An elongated egg, or a Tic Tac,\" that was uniformly white\nacross the entire body. It was approximately 46 feet in length. One of the pilots, with his\nweapons officer in the back, wanted to get a closer look. It is actually just another\nquirk of the image sensors that they use in the military\non these specialized cameras. - The second biggest bank\ncollapse in US history. - The bank is called\nthe Silicon Valley Bank. So now the banker, with his new loan, goes and buys his oven for $9,000, and the oven seller takes that $9,000, and goes and puts it in their bank. This document from the\nUS Department of Defense, this year's is more detailed. China, \"Remains our most\nconsequential strategic competitor for coming decades.\" And so now you see a competition, between these two great powers\nthat have become deeply, economically entwined\nover the last 50 years. I'm not anti-milk. I (beeps) love milk. No, seriously, we got to do this. - Got milk? Oh. (Nick laughs) Look at it. It looks great, dude. - My full-time job is to do journalism. I sit around and\nfact-check things all day. If I get something wrong,\nit's a cardinal sin. Joseph Smith, he's someone I know well. He's the author of a worldview that I held for most of my life. - Nearly half of Sudan's\nremaining population is in dire humanitarian need. - [Johnny] Sudan is moving\ntowards a civil war. Let me get you up to speed\non what's happening here, and show you how Sudan's\nlocation here near the Suez Canal in the Horn of Africa, makes\nit geopolitically important. These messages were spread and amplified by one social media\nplatform in this country that was just starting\nto use the internet. - Conspiracies and\nincitements to violence, all directed at the\ncountry's Muslim minority, are just overrunning the platform. - [Johnny] So let me show you\nhow the US kept their colony in the Caribbean using brute force, spying, and the abuse of land and people. This is how the US stole Puerto Rico. Yugoslavia, a federation of six countries, is ripping itself apart. Their economy is in ruin, and they're replacing\ncommunism with nationalism, the kind that thrives\non focusing on ethnic and religious differences, forcibly punching out a\ngovernment from power. No elections, no process, just power being seized. But I wanna show you how\nthe coup has been used by the United States of America as a tool to get what they\nwant on the world stage. - [Female Reporter] Rockets\nand airstrikes continue to rain down on Israel and Gaza. - And this is where we need to zoom out to get a bigger picture look\nat the rest of this region. How did we get this? A map so detailed, to truly unveil Antarctica's mysteries, we needed to venture inside it. (gentle music) - We'll talk about it tomorrow, but I just didn't want\nyou to stress tonight. I wanted you to know that\nthings are good, okay? All right. - [Johnny] Look at this happy guy. Look at this happy guy. [Man] I love you!\n- He was going through his own little\nemotional rollercoaster. Thank you. Thank you, Teryn. And look, we have Greenland. (gentle music) I'm at an airport in rural Greenland. It's like in this fjord system, near the village of Uummannaq. All of the cameras and\nstuff just keep dying because it's so damn cold. It is -30 degrees. In Greenland, Greenland,\nGreenland, Greenland, Greenland. Should I reference Greenland? I'd be like, \"I just was up here.\" Like, I can't not be like, by the way, like.\n- [Alex] No. - If there's one thing\nKim Jong II like to do, it was to talk about\nhis thoughts on cinema. He wrote an entire book about it, which was kind of the impetus of this entire video, this book. Oh, you should have just put\nthis book in front of Johnny. Johnny's walking around and he sees it, he's like, \"Oh, what's this?\" He's like, \"We gotta\nmake a video about this.\" And that put an idea in the pipeline that would eventually become\nmy North Korean cinema video. - This is for the moon landing video. It's thick. - We hired someone with an old-timey, radio transatlantic\naccent to do it instead. Buckle up for this one. (film reel clicking) - [David] In a world on\nthe brink of destruction. - [Johnny] We talked to astrophysicists, meteorologists, and NASA historians, to better understand the\nmoon landing conspiracy. There's basically no chance\nof getting a decent shot of the stars in this environment. - Former Congressman,\namong several people hit with insider trading charges today. - Their insider knowledge may\nhelp them make the best bets on Wall Street. Congressman Ro Khanna from California. making bank during financial meltdown. Oh my God, no. I have children, and if I ever gave them this much milk, I would feel like a criminal. (man laughs) On March 13th, 1962, the joint chiefs of\nstaff put this document in front of the Secretary of Defense for approval from the president. A secret meeting, and\nthe memo it produced, meant only for the eyes\nof top British officials. These leaders wanted to remind the world who the global superpower was, and they've been doing it for a long time. - Russia may sabotage undersea cables. - If you have access to submarine cables, which governments and militaries do, you can scrape through the\ninsulation of this cable, you can splice in another cable, and you can duplicate the signal, and hear everything your enemy is saying. These few 100 cables\nthat connect our world, contain an unfathomable amount of data, and it would seem impossible that any government agency\nwould be able to spy on it all. Impossible, that is, if we didn't have solid\nproof that they do. We've been talking to Russian journalists, a lot of them independent, who have moved to YouTube\nto try to escape censorship. You could be swimming\nin the ocean one day, minding your own business,\nand right below you, there could literally be this massive, 48,000-ton metal machine with\na couple 100 humans aboard, equipped with nuclear warheads that could be launched\nat a moment's notice. What have we created? I started a new channel with my old Vox colleague, Sam Ellis. It is live now, it is called Search Party. Rival politicians and a new class of ultra wealthy businessmen\ncalled oligarchs, were battling for power\nunder a weakening Yeltsin. According to data gathered by ESPN, between 1900 and 1989, the All Blacks won 71% of their tests. If China begins the invasion, its missiles still could destroy\nTaiwan's planes and ships. (bright upbeat music) (party horn blares) I need to show you a video.\n- [Man] Pause real quick. (upbeat music) - Henry Kissinger, one\nof the most controversial and powerful figures in\nAmerican politics, is dead. It's unlike any substance on earth. - [Man] There's nothing wrong\nwith drinking olive oil. - This stuff is so good. Yeah, that gap up here. Okay, get another bag. I gotta tell you something really quick. I have a slightly complicated\nrelationship with breakfast. The camera is just covered in cheese. In another study, 92% of the\nsupplements that were tested by scientists were\ncontaminated with bacteria. Get your nose in there. - You've been doing this\nfor an hour and a half. - Don't kill Johnny. (bright upbeat music) Through Greenland, exploring\nthis massive island. Mostly, I've been in the fjords\nin these rural communities, hunting for seals and riding on dog sleds. Bet, like. - [Nick] Say it confidently.\n- Bet, bet, bet. (upbeat music) (Nick laughs) I'm not in touch. I'm not in touch. Here in the office, we actually had some\npretty nice heated debates about Joe Rogan. - Unbelievably insane. - Militants who seizes\nan Israeli-owned tanker, over the weekend were\nlikely Somali pirates. - [Johnny] This line going\nup represents the expansion of the piracy industry in Somalia. - The worst nuclear\nreactor accident to date. - Today, nuclear power is in decline, and I've been trying to understand why. I ended up in a conversation\nwith my friend, Cleo, who makes a show called \"Huge If True\". (bright upbeat music) (party horn blares) Ah, feels amazing.\n- Dude. (clock ticking)\n(bright upbeat music) - Okay, so that's all I've got, and we will see you all next year. - Bye, everyone.\n- Bye. - Unplug me. Here's the video. - Three, two, one. - Five high. - Oh, that worked. - That was cute.\n- Yeah. (all murmuring) - [Female] Thank you.\n- [Man] We miss you. Bye, everyone. (bright upbeat music) - I was out of frame, guys, really? (cameraman laughing) I made the music here. (cameraman laughs) Yeah, I should have been front. (indistinct) Goddammit."

And Russia does not like this. So as a response, they have been sending migrants from like war zones that are looking for asylum and safety to this border. And they're putting them on bicycles. And they have nowhere to go but into Finland. Now, Russia knows that Finland is required to let these asylum seekers in, and the hope here is that this flood of migrants will create discord and division within Finnish society and will make them angry at this decision to join NATO or to let U.S. troops in. Putin is using these migrants as a weapon in his hybrid warfare against the West. So in response, Finland actually closed these land border crossings. And so now you have this terrible situation of migrants just sitting there, not able to go anywhere in these terrible conditions.

We recently published a video about drone warfare in the war in Ukraine, and it was one of the more ambitious videos I've ever made, and yet it like flopped. And I don't have videos flop very often, this is weird. And I was scratching my head until I started to realize that the world is losing interest in this war. Like, this was like the focus of the entire world for years. Western people and governments have been pouring money and attention and support on Ukraine since Russia invaded. But now governments are debating whether or not they should give any money or weapons to Ukraine anymore. People have turned their attention to other things. The war in Israel is pulling people's attention away. Global conflict really relies on global attention. A conflict like the war in Ukraine could be won or lost based on how much we pay attention to it, how much we pressure our government to continue to support it. That support seems to be waning and the people of Ukraine and their leaders are pretty nervous. If you want to better understand global politics, follow along for more."

The map claims all of this land; land which is a part of the sovereign country of Guyana. Like they're claiming well over half of Guyana's territory. What is going on here? Well, there are two answers. The first one is the British. Back in 1899, the British and Venezuela agreed on this border. But Venezuela now says that that was a biased decision and that it was actually just colonial shenanigans by the U.S. and the U.K. And that actually this is their land. But the real answer here is oil. In 2015, they discovered a massive oil deposit right off of the coast of Guyana. They're making $1 billion a year off this. Venezuela wants this oil and they think they have a claim to all of this land. And so they're going to fight for it. Guyana, obviously is not letting this happen. They're going to fight about it. It's going to be a thing. I'm going to keep following it. If you want to better understand global politics, follow along for more."

    "captions": "(suspenseful music)\n(horn blares) (crowd applauds)\n(camera shutter clicks) - [Johnny] The US government is quietly reshaping the global economy in ways that will change\nour world forever. (tense music) You can see this in just one sentence from Joe Biden's first\naddress to Congress. (Congress applauding) - Think about it, there is simply no reason why\nthe blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh\ninstead of Beijing. No reason, no reason, none.\n(Congress applauds) - [Johnny] This seems just like a boring political statement, but I promise this statement\nis a bigger deal than it seems because it marks a new\nera in our global system, a system that all of us participate in, whether we know it or not, or maybe it's a rerun\nof an economic system that the globe turned to right\nbefore the Second World War. - There's no reason why\nAmerican workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have the capacity.\n(Congress applauds) (tense music)\n(machine flutters) - [Johnny] In this video, I\nwant to peek under the hood of the endlessly complex and\nfascinating global economy, to show you just how deeply\nconnected we've all become and how those connections\nare being cut and weaponized. All of this thanks to\nnew threats, new risks, new realizations, new values, and above all, a new rivalry\nbetween two great powers. This is the world that we are moving into. It's how things will\nwork for decades to come, and it's important that we understand it. (suspenseful music) So let me give you an overview of what is becoming\nthe new global economy. - The new tariffs from both sides went into effect earlier this morning. - [Reporter] The US\ntariffs have kicked in. - China can't put as many tariffs on us as we can put on them. - China is still the biggest\nthreat to the United States. (tense music) - [Biden] Folks, we\nneed to make these chips right here in America. - Hey, so for a long time I've\nbeen at war with marketers, people who call my phone, even\nthough I don't want them to, and who send me emails, even though I never gave\nthem my email address. We're all familiar with this. It's called spam, and it\nis increasingly a problem. But then I recently learned\nthat I actually have the right to request that I be taken\noff of all of the lists that people use to buy\nand sell my information. The problem is, even though\nI have all these rights, I'm not gonna go through the process of like requesting a formal\nlike removal of my name off of every one of these hundreds of data broker lists that I'm on. Incogni is the sponsor of today's video, which is why I'm talking about this. I'm very grateful to them for\nsupporting our journalism. I signed up for Incogni, and I gave them permission\nto act on my behalf to go take my name off\nof data broker lists, and then they start the\nprocess of requesting that your name be taken off. Some of these companies are kind of shady and they like try to push back, and Incogni takes the time to follow up and push until you are\ntaken off that list. The best part is you get\nto watch the progress all on this nice dashboard that tells you what lists your\nname has been taken off of. I recently learned just how pervasive these data broker lists are. Like, they use it not only to like fill up your inbox with spam, but also to like track\nyour web browsing activity, which they then can sell to\nlike a health insurance company, which could like jack up your premiums. Luckily, Incogni has helped\nstrip me away from these lists, and my phone is now strangely quiet. My inbox is not a hornet's nest. So if you wanna try this out, there's a link in my description. It is incogni.com/johnnyharris. When you click the link, you\nget a pretty big discount. It's like 60% off when you\nsign up for the annual plan. I do the annual plan because once you're taken off these lists, you immediately get put back on, and Incogni constantly\nmonitors month after month to make sure that you\nstay off these lists. So yeah, big discount. Click the link in my description, use the code, and you'll\nget the big discount. You can try it out and see if\nit clears your life of spam and makes you feel like you\nhave a little more privacy in your life. Let's dive into this story. It's a big one, it's an important one, and I'm excited to share it with you. (mysterious music) The economy that we live in, that we all take for granted,\nis actually relatively new. The clothes that you're\nwearing right now, the computer or the phone that you're\nlooking at to watch this video, the materials that your\nhouse is made out of, the fibers in the blanket\nthat you use at night, the food you eat, all of it is a product of perhaps one of the most\nsignificant achievements of our species: global trade. (mysterious music)\n(camera shutter clicking) Early on, humans discovered\nthe magic that occurs when a group of people specialize in producing something\nvaluable like grain. They make more than they need, and then they take that excess and they give it to another group who also made too much of something because they specialize in a\nspecific thing, maybe textiles. And through this exchange, both parties benefit way more\nthan they could on their own. It was this kind of cooperation\nthat leveled our species up beyond any other animal on Earth. So we just kept doing it. In fact, the history of\nour human civilization is largely the history of people trading on an ever-growing scale. Today, this is normal.\nWe call it the economy. By the time the 1900s rolled around, we had a pretty connected world. There was global trade all over the place, but it was still pretty clunky. Everyone had different trade\nrules, different currencies. Countries were worried that\nforeign products would threaten their domestic producers, so\nthey put up trade barriers and imposed big tariffs on\nstuff coming into their country. Then, 70 years, ago came that war that almost tore this world apart. (explosions thunder)\n(engines rumble) Out of the ashes of that war, the US emerged as the most\npowerful country ever. It had troops and influence\nin every corner of the globe. And with that new power, the US and its allies wrote a new playbook for the world economy.\n(dollar sign chimes) They would make it so that the US dollar was the top currency. Everything would kind of\nbe pegged to the US dollar. This helped stabilize the whole system. It helped it move more predictably. It helped countries send and\nreceive money across borders. The US also got countries together with the goal of lowering\nthe taxes imposed on products flowing in and\nout of their country: tariffs. And through all these efforts, all these new rules, borders opened up. Investors could put their\nmoney almost anywhere on Earth to grow new businesses. Corporations could look to far away lands for cheaper workers to\nset up their factories. The world became one big market, and it started to benefit\nhundreds of millions of people. (bright music) So much so that even\nanti-capitalist China couldn't stay out of this global economy that\nwas so unrecognizably open, that was so much more open than anything the world had ever seen. There was way too much money\nto be made, so China jumped in. They said that they\nwould remain communists, but they would open up a few\ndozen of their coastal cities to be open for business\nin this new global market. Millions of China's rural poor flocked to the coastal cities, these\ngateways to the global market. They showed up ready to\nwork, and to work for cheap. A world away, over in the United States, corporations looked at\nall of their factories in places like Detroit and Buffalo, and realized that it would\nmake a lot more sense for them to move all of\nthese factories to China where they could pay workers\na fraction of the wage. And, spoiler alert, all\nthese coastal cities in China that opened up to the global\neconomy soon looked like this. Hundreds of millions of\npeople in China lifted out of poverty and thrust into this\nnew middle and upper class, all thanks to the magic\nof the global economy based on the rules and policies that the US had set up after World War II. It was so good for China and\na bunch of other countries, but for the many Americans\nwhose jobs had just been given to someone in like Shanghai,\nthis didn't feel like magic. It felt like betrayal, like a recipe for poverty and ghost towns. (haunting music) This China shock was one\nof the first big tastes of the economic pain that this\nglobal economy could inflict on huge numbers of people. But to everyone else,\nit was totally worth it, because thanks to this system, people were suddenly seeing\nprices at their stores drop further than seemed possible. Washing machines, shoes,\ntools, toasters, couches, shirts, socks, toys,\nmattresses, lawn chairs, anything you can think of is now flowing from Chinese factories and available for dirt\ncheap at your local Walmart, all while transforming the lives of people in places like Vietnam,\nIndia, Chile, and Thailand, who saw huge economic\ngrowth during these years. So by the '80s, China's\nfully in the global economy, and it is a gravy train. The US and UK both elect leaders who love this free-trade\nglobal capitalism. - More trade, not less is\nthe wave of the future. - The new system was boosted by all of this new technology\nthat was coming out, making it easier to pass\ninformation across borders, to move money, to move people, to move goods across the globe. A globe. Promise to obey. If we all believe and obey these rules, it creates the conditions that made the world into\na giant marketplace, where a corporation could\nsource whatever they needed to make their product from\nanywhere in the world, whatever made the most economic sense. Soon, products as simple as a T-shirt would travel along an\nunfathomably complex supply chain, using material and labor from many countries all around the globe, before eventually showing up conveniently just in time at the store. Policy had created mass\ncooperation between billions of people who don't\nspeak the same language, who don't know each other, but are somehow all getting\nin on the same market. This mental construct of economic policy is what created globalization, the globalization we know today. And what's crazy to me is that, if you tinker with the\npolicy, if you mess with this, you can reverse a lot\nof this globalization, which is exactly what's\nhappening right now. - There is simply no reason why\nthe blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh\ninstead of Beijing. - Okay, but let's stick\nto our timeline here. We're kind of in the '90s. And I'll tell you, people in\nthe '90s would've never guessed what direction this story is about to go. The Soviet Union had just fallen, free trade and global capitalism had unambiguously beat communism, and the magic of the free\nmarket was seen as the solution for pretty much everything. Free trade had just ended global conflict between these great\nsuperpowers, maybe forever. Free trade was eradicating global poverty. Free trade was pushing\ncountries to adopt democracy. And here's Bill Clinton, giddy about how good it's all going, predicting that free trade\nwould bring democracy to China. - The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate\nthe potential of its people, their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have\nthe power not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say. - Free trade would prevent\nour age-old human curse, war, by so deeply entangling countries in mutually beneficial deals that it wouldn't make sense to fight. After all, free trade had turned Europe from a continent ravaged by\nwar to this tightly-knit group where everyone's holding\nhands and smiling together. Why wouldn't this naturally\njust happen to the whole globe? China continued to make stuff and send it to the United States. Our dependency on them and\nthem on us continue to grow, and that would surely\nprevent any conflict, right? Um, no.\n(deflated music) It's looking like that's\nnot how it's gonna turn out. In fact, it's kind of the opposite. - The new tariffs from both sides went into effect earlier this morning. The US has imposed 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. - China is our military's\nmost consequential strategic competitor and pacing challenge. - In a relatively sudden shift, governments around the\nworld are undoing a lot of this globalization, this\nsolution to all of our problems. They're rejecting it. India is paying companies\nto keep their production within their own borders, especially for important industries like pharmaceuticals and electronics. South Korea is giving\ntaxpayer money to companies to produce green energy infrastructure instead of waiting for the\nfree market to come build it. Japan is paying companies to\nmove production back to Japan and to move their supply\nchains away from China. Australia is using taxpayer money to encourage mining companies\nto establish the processing of rare-earth mineral\nfacilities within their borders instead of abroad. Nigeria is imposing\nrestrictions on foreign goods that they want to see\nproduced domestically, like rice and cement. They don't wanna be\nreliant on other countries. And then you've got Europe, where tons of countries are\ninvesting government money and protecting homegrown industries that have always been directed\nby the global economy, like energy, agriculture, and cars. The government getting\ninvolved in these markets incentivizes companies\nand consumers to make and sell these products in country as opposed to looking\nabroad at the global market. And of course, leading out on all of this is the OG of the modern\nfree-market global economy, the United States, who is\nsuddenly changing course from how they've been operating, all the way up until like Obama. Like, Obama spent a great deal of his time trying to increase free\ntrade, especially with Asia. Then, first under Trump\nand now under Biden, the US is overhauling its economic policy to turn back some of this free trade. And what's crazy is that both Republicans and Democrats seem to agree\nthat we should do this and fast. (upbeat music)\n- There is no reason. We have the capacity.\n(Congress applauds) - Some of these policies\ninclude huge government spending bills, like the CHIPS Act, which would allocate over 50\nbillion government dollars to companies that produce microchips here in the United States,\ninstead of in Asia, where the free market had\npulled them to set up. This is also happening in other industries that the government has deemed vital, like critical minerals,\ncars, and clean energy. But they're not just giving subsidies, like, it's not just\ngovernment money washing down on all these industries,\nit's also barriers. Biden is imposing tariffs on imports, which protects domestic\nproducers of certain industries because they no longer have to compete with the global market. They're also banning American companies from selling certain products to China. They're increasing\nscrutiny on any investment that comes in from places like China. Like, this is a big shift. And the question is, what happened? How did we get from this free-trade heyday that was supposed to usher\nin world peace to this? (upbeat music) - Markets have been whipsawed all morning, and now afternoon, by this\nongoing trade war with China. - The short answer is one word, the answer to all of this: protection. Here's my list of four protections that best explain this big\nshift in economic policy. (mysterious music)\nFirst, workers, which we already kind\nof talked about briefly with the China shock. For all the winners of the global economy, there were lots of losers, and a lot of them were communities who found themselves out of work as their jobs went to\ncheaper overseas locations. Now listen, economists argue as to how big of a problem this actually was, and you can read all\nabout it in my sources, but the point is that closed factories and unemployed communities\nin the Rust Belt have a major psychological\neffect on people who fear that their jobs\nmight just disappear, either abroad or be taken over by AI. So the government is\ntrying to calm people down by pumping money into certain sectors to keep jobs in America. The next big realization\nabout the global economy: It doesn't really care much about how much carbon it\npumps into our atmosphere. Our world is barreling towards\na very real climate crisis, and governments realize they're gonna have to force the market to get serious about things like electric\ncars, solar panels, and other green infrastructure. The free market is not\ngoing to incentivize this. And if it doesn't happen, we're gonna have a much\nbigger problem on our hands. (mysterious music) One of the best parts\nof the global economy is that our products get made by materials that are being tossed around\nthe globe at the perfect time, at the perfect place, to all come together to be made into a final product, all to arrive at a shelf at some store so that we can purchase it. These supply chains are insane, and they cross the entire planet. And it works great until the world shut down\nin a global pandemic, leaving people around the world without the products\nthat they either needed or just kinda got used to having. Again, economists argue about\nhow big of a deal this was. A lot of them are like, \"No, the supply chains held\nup really well during COVID.\" But regardless of what some\nacademic economist is saying at MIT, all of us are left\nwith a pretty bad taste in our mouth about supply\nchains after COVID. The system feels too fragile. A lot of us feel too\nreliant on a fragile system of far away global connections that could be rocked at any moment, which has led to these\nprotectionist policies that these governments hope\nwill bring supply chains back inside of their borders. Okay, finally, and perhaps\nthe most important explanation in all of this, is that Bill\nClinton was totally wrong. Free trade didn't incentivize China into a democratic revolution. The world did not join together in one big free-trade market, too entangled to fight with each other. In fact, quite the opposite has happened. - Relations between the\nworld's two largest economies are at their most tense in years. - After joining the global economy, China got really rich really fast. They've kind of started to\nchallenge the US at its own game, and now they have one of\nthe biggest militaries on the planet, and they use that military to assert their influence\naround their region. They use their newfound wealth to project influence around the world by building stuff or\ngiving loans to people. And they're kind of trying\nto dethrone the United States as the one who's calling the shots on the global economic order. I made a whole video about this that you can go watch if you want, but the big point here\nis that the US is worried about the rapid rise of\ntheir rival across the ocean, especially when the rise of that rival is in part fueled by American technology, specifically these little\nsilicon chips, microchips, that make weapons smart, and that will be the brains\nthat power the AI revolution. A lot of Joe Biden's\nprotectionist policies are actually just aimed right at China, trying to stop them\nfrom using our own tech to get ahead of us. Again, I made an entire\nvideo about microchips. You can go to that. I've kind of made a video\nabout a lot of these things. But yeah, Joe Biden is also\ntrying to get the supply chains for these microchips out\nof China's neighborhood, meaning out of Taiwan, bringing\nthem back inside our borders to places like New Albany, Ohio, nice and safe in the\nmiddle of our continent. So you're gonna see a lot\nmore moments like this with American presidents or\npoliticians with hard hats on, speaking at construction sites. - Folks, we need to make these\nchips right here in America to bring down everyday\ncost and create good jobs. America's back, and\nAmerica's leading the way. (tense music) - This last point is kind\nof a brutal recognition for a lot of people,\nincluding me, to be honest, that our theory that we\nwould all be more peaceful if we were more economically\nentangled is kind of wrong, at least for now. In fact, these economic\nentanglements are looking like they might turn\ninto tools of conflict as opposed to preventers of conflict. Like, China has a near monopoly on a lot of the rare-earth elements\nthat we need to make a ton of very important products,\nincluding military weapons. And if push comes to shove, they could very realistically\nuse this as leverage and cut us off in the exact same way that we cut them off microchips. I mean, this just happened. Vladimir Putin turned off the pipelines that pumped natural gas into Europe, the gas that is needed to heat the homes and run the factories, showing us that economic entanglements can actually be a weapon, and flipping this whole\ntheory on its head. But yeah, Joe Biden is pouring money into bringing production home, and he has a lot of support\nfrom all sides of the aisle. So it's like economic nationalism. The government is getting\ninvolved to undo some of what the free market did in its heyday, which was to distribute\nproduction of stuff where it made the most economic sense, not where it protected people. - That means we will invent it in America and make it in America, and we're gonna make sure\nwe include all of America. - So that's where we're at. The world is reacting to\nsome weaknesses that they see in the global free-trade system. They're putting up barriers\nin the name of protection. And no one's really sure what that means. Like, it's kind of hard\nto not look at this and draw some parallels with the 1930s when a series of economic\ncrises led countries to put up trade barriers\nin the name of protection, which then led to ever\ngreater economic strife, leading to unrest and\neventually culminating in the Second World War.\n(deflated music) But don't read too far into that. I'm not trying to like\ndo one of those things where I'm like, \"Every hundred years, history repeats itself.\" That's not what I think is happening here. But there's some similarities that we should probably\njust keep an eye on. A suite of crises that\nmake us turn inward, that surge populism and\neconomic nationalism and the rise of tensions\nbetween great powers. (bright music) Hey, before you go, I need\nto tell you one last thing, which is that we made\nprobably our last batch of the poster that I designed last year. It's a poster called \"All Maps Are Wrong,\" and I'm very proud of it. It shows all the ways that\nyou can take our Earth and project it onto a 2D plane, which always comes with some distortion. Anyway, it's kind of a\nnerdy map-lover thing, and if you're into that, you\nshould go over and check it out before they're all gone. This is probably gonna be our last batch, so get 'em while they last, and the link's in the description."

    "captions": "Britain and Greece are kind of fighting with each other over these statues. These are sculptures that are 2000 years old and they're housed in the British Museum in London Back in the 1800s, a British lord took these sculptures from Greece, brought them to the UK. Crucially, he did get permission from the Ottoman Empire, which at the time did control Greece. But once Greece got their independence, they asked for the statues back. And of course, Britain said \u201cno.\u201d Fast forward to last week when the Greek prime minister said this on the BBC, We feel that these sculptures belong to Greece and that they were essentially stolen. And this pissed off the British prime minister so much that he canceled his meeting with the Greek prime minister. But like, come on. These statues are from Greece. There's literally a place in the Parthenon that is dedicated to these statues that's just sitting there blank, waiting for them to return to their rightful place But the British are just not going to budge on this. They're like, \u201cNo, we stole these, and we're going to just keep them, like we did with everything else that we've stolen from around the world.\u201d If you want to better global politics, follow along for more."

But this is what's crazy, that same week. they also arrested 133 Palestinians. This is what a lot of people don't really understand about the Israeli occupation. Is that one of the most egregious things that Israel does is that they just arrest Palestinians without charging them with a crime. A lot of these Palestinians are like teenage boys who are arrested for like effectively throwing stones, Since the terrorist attack of October 7th, Israel has been going nuts on arresting people in the West Bank, which is different than Gaza, where Hamas is. They've detained over 3000 Palestinians in the West Bank, which is ten times the number of people that they've released. These people don't know why they're arrested. They will never have a trial, like, this is not due process. This is not the rule of law. This is occupation. It's wrong. Many of these kids are going to be in prison for months or years.

    "captions": "(dramatic music) - Imagine you're getting\nready to go to the gym, you grab your keys and your bag, and then you take a supplement, and you feel like it's working. It might be working a little too well. What you don't know is\nthat this supplement, one that you bought at the health aisle at your grocery store is laced\nwith an anabolic steroid, an illegal drug invisibly\nmixed into this powder. In recent years researchers have been grabbing thousands of different supplements off the shelf, and testing them to see what's inside. And what they found in over 3000 supplements that they tested is that 28% had some sort\nof illegal substance, mostly steroids, meaning the\npeople that are taking them are unintentionally doping. In another study, 92% of the\nsupplements that were tested by scientists were\ncontaminated with bacteria. 87% had fungal contamination, And when they tested CBD supplements they found that 55% of the\noils had either way more or way less CBD than stated on the label. And a few of them even had THC in them, the thing that gets you high. And it turns out the government\nhere in the United States doesn't seem to care. So how did we get here? And why are shady companies,\ninfluencer campaigns and targeted advertisements selling Americans things\nto put in their body that aren't what they say they are, and that are potentially dangerous? And I guess a big question for me is which of these are actually\nnecessary or healthy? And which of them are dangerous? And is this all just a waste of money? (gentle music) Hey, pause really quick. You know how we started this video with this hypothetical scenario that I'm drinking workout supplements? Well, I actually do workout now. For the first time in my adult life I am kind of buff. The sponsor of today's\nvideo is the reason why. Thank you CoPilot for\nsponsoring the video. This is a game changer. CoPilot is a platform that pairs you up with your very own fitness coach. My coach is named Devon, he's great. You meet with your coach, and you tell them what you want. For me, I don't wanna get buff, but I want to be able\nto like lift my body, and be like strong and not have back pain. And he designed a full-blown like workout, and he can customize it and change it, and I communicate with him. There's no decision making here. You press go, and it guides you through your workout with little video examples so you know exactly what you're supposed\nto do for exactly how long, and then you move on to the next thing. Over the months your workout will change as you give feedback\nto your personal coach, who's always tinkering with it\nbased on what you want to do, what you don't like, what you like. It turns out that accountability is basically the key to\nkeeping a workout routine, having someone to stand accountable to. And that's the major\nbenefit to this in my mind is there's a real human being\nwho's checking in on me. \"Are you working out?\" But it's also really nice to have a professional\ntaking all the guesswork out of my workouts. So CoPilot is awesome, I'm grateful for them\nsponsoring today's video. I'm grateful they exist. I'm grateful that I can do 10\npull-ups now because of them. And if you want to try this out there's a nice sweet discount that they're giving to all\nthe viewers of my channel if they click the link in the description, and they sign up before February 1st. You get 14 days for free to try this out with your own personalized coach, see if it works for you. And 20% off your first month. So you can try it out at as a discount, see if it works for you. But, again, use the\nlink in my description, because doing so gets you the discount, it helps support the channel. And do it before February 1st. Okay, that's it. Let's dive in to this\nstory about supplements. (drum bangs) It's easy to look at stuff like this, and say it's kind of like medicine, and so it would be kind of\nregulated like medicine, tracked and vetted by our\ngovernment's health agency like medicine is. But medicine goes through\na very different process, a super lengthy process\nwith tons of studies and clinical trials, paperwork. It takes years and years, and a lot of drugs aren't\never even approved. They fail this process, and never make it onto the shelf. But supplements don't\nhave to do any of that. - Companies are responsible for ensuring their products are safe, and in fact can often put new dietary supplements on the market without even telling FDA. - There are rules on\nwhat supplement companies are allowed to put in\ntheir pills and gummies, but these rules aren't\nenforced in any real way. It's up to the supplement\ncompany to obey them. - With dietary supplements\nit's on the honor system that they are following\nthose rules and regulations. - That's Dr. C. Michael White, - A pharmacist, distinguished professor and chair of pharmacy practice at the University of\nConnecticut School of Pharmacy. - And this is Dr. F. Perry Wilson. - I am a physician and researcher\nhere at Yale University. (bell dings) - These two doctors helped\nus a lot in our reporting, helped us navigate this\nreally complex topic, and helped us better understand how this $50 billion a year industry runs wild with all of these products that make health claims that are often not backed up by anything. There's a wild story on how we got here, and to understand it we\nhave to go back to the 80's and 90's to understand\nthis political commercial featuring Mel Gibson\nand health supplements. - It's only vitamins. - [Reporter] Nelson Mandela\ngot a rousing welcome from the city of New York today. - The East German authorities have said the Berlin Wall doesn't\nmean anything anymore. - Oh yeah. - The 90's was a time of\neconomic prosperity in America, which fueled the rise of a health conscious middle class that was increasingly\nattracted to health foods and fitness regimes, and alternative medicine. - I avoid sugar, that makes me feel good about me. - To cater to this shift, you have this supplement industry, which was very small\nand niche at the time, but they met the demand\nof this new middle class and began diversifying their offerings. They expanded beyond the\ntypical vitamin C tablets and echinacea drops, introducing a variety of new substances, each purporting to enhance\none's life in unique ways. One of the supplements\nthat gained popularity was called L-Tryptophan. It was this health food supplement made of amino acids that claimed to help people sleep and lose weight. It sounded healthy enough until doctors found that\npeople who took the stuff were developing blood and muscle disorders. Investigations found that it\nled to the death of 38 people. In response to this incident, Congress began drafting laws that would tighten regulation\non health supplements. So they drafted this bill. The bill would give more power to the FDA to regulate these companies, to tighten the rules on how supplements were able to be labeled, what claims they could make. But, as we know, whenever there's a growing industry that's making a lot of\nmoney off of selling things and the government comes in\nand tries to regulate them, they don't just sit\nback and let it happen. So all the supplement\ncompanies got together, they held these emergency meetings, they sent an army of\nlobbyists to Washington, and they started pouring\nmoney on commercials. - Help make sure your child gets a balanced diet with Flintstones. - And this is where Mel Gibson, the 90's movie star, comes into the story. (gentle music) - [Officer] Freeze. - Hey guys, guys, it's\ngot it's only vitamins. Vitamin C, you know, like in oranges. - [Narrator] If you don't\nwanna lose your vitamins, make the FDA stop. - Yeah, they weren't messing around here. They published books, they sent flyers to people's mailboxes. They produced more commercials, they created petitions to rally Americans around their supplements, and it worked. More and more Americans\nwere taking supplements, and they responded to this potential tightening of regulation, and all of this fear\nmongering by the lobbyists by writing to Congress, telling the government not\nto regulate supplements, to let them keep their vitamins. At the same time, these lobbyists targeted the lawmakers themselves, convincing them to oppose the legislation that was under consideration in Congress, and to actually counter it\nby passing their own law, a law that would be\nfriendly to the industry. And you can actually see this point blank. Sometimes lobbying is foggy, and we don't know what happened, but in this case the senators\nwho received the most money from the industry were the ones who actually drafted the\nnew bill for this law. And here it is. Public law 103-417 from October 25, 1994. So what started as an attempt\nto regulate supplements actually turned into a law that is friendly to the industry, and the reason we have this. (dramatic music) I mean I love when you're neck\ndeep in one of these laws, and you just see a statement that just makes it so clear\nwho was influencing this law. Check this out. This law just straight up says that the federal government should not take any actions to impose unreasonable regulatory\nbarriers towards this industry. And especially, says the law, this industry is really lucrative. It has annual sales of $4 billion. Congress wouldn't wanna slow that down. So then the big kicker here, one of the key parts of the law is that they specify that supplements, the thing in this bottle is\nnot classified as medicine, it's classified as food. That's how the FDA\nshould treat it, as food. But supplements are not food in the same way a bag of Doritos is food, they're much more complicated. But we'll get back to that in a sec. The point is that this\nlaw gave the industry a lot of freedom, including what kind of\nclaims they could make. The law gave them the authority\nto say a lot of things about what their health\nsupplement does for people as long as they include\nthis one disclaimer. I'm looking at Genius Mushrooms. The product says that it is\nhealthy immune system support, energy and clarity. Sounds great. But then here on the back\nin very, very, very small, teeny tiny, almost illegible font, zoom in here, you will\nsee a teeny tiny statement that complies with the law. These statements have not been evaluated by the food administrator. This product is not intended to diagnose. It's right there in the fine print that no one is reading. What people are reading is this. Healthy immune system\nsupport, energy and clarity. I mean, the law is so\nfriendly to the industry. It allows these companies to effectively regulate themselves. The law makes it clear that it's the government's job to go prove that something\nis adulterated or wrong rather than making the companies prove that their products are safe\nbefore they go to market. I mean it's totally backwards. - We do not approve them for safety and effectiveness before they are sold. Companies are responsible for ensuring their products are safe. - So thanks to this 1994 law supplement makers were very happy because now they don't have\nto tell the FDA anything. They don't have to prove that\ntheir claims are effective, they just have to put a little\ntiny fine print disclaimer. And the FDA has no real\nenforcement regime. They only really step in in a big way after the supplement is\nproven to be hurting people. Any authority they do have to check on the supplements has to be done with their shoestring budget. This was Congress giving the supplement\nindustry a blank check, telling them they can do what you want, we can't regulate you, it's now the law. And this is why the industry went from a $4 billion industry in the early 90's to a $53 billion industry today. This is why Americans are now inundated with capsules and pills and drops and creams and teas that claim to\nmake your body work better. But this is confusing because supplements actually\ndo have a place in our lives for certain people who need certain things that their body can't make. So one of my questions\ngoing into all of this is what of this is legit? Is any of it, or is it all just snake oil? What does the science actually say? (gentle music) There's been a lot of good study on this, and luckily we got one\nof those amazing things where they do a study\nof all of the studies, and they put it all together, and they say \"This is what all the studies \"have concluded over the years.\" Like a good old meta-analysis. This meta-analysis, which used 84 studies, and put it all together\nto find conclusions, found that vitamins and supplements were generally, quote,\nassociated with little or no benefit in preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease and death. It had a little bit of a benefit on treating cancer if you already have it. They also found that people\nwith a high risk of lung cancer had a, quote, increased\nrisk of lung cancer and other harmful outcomes by taking one vitamin, betacarotene. So what this basically is saying\nis that vitamins don't work for the big things, preventing the killers like\ncancer and heart problems. And they maybe even hurt us in some cases, depending on the supplement. But in reading these\nconclusions you start to realize just how complex this is. There are like thousands\nof different supplements, and there are innumerable\nnumbers of individual bodies that have different chemistry\nand different experiences. It starts to get confusing to find a satisfying conclusion. So we asked our experts do supplements actually make\nus healthier in any way? - Many doctors would suggest that you don't need to\ntake supplements at all, unless you have a deficiency. - Ah deficiency, that's the key word here. So maybe my body doesn't\nnaturally produce enough vitamin C or I don't get it in my food, then a supplement would be useful. - If you're a strict vegan, you have very strong dietary restrictions for whatever reason, those people probably are good candidates for taking a multivitamin. - That's a situation where\nit makes a lot of sense. But most of us don't need to do that. Whenever there's a situation where all the humans in a society need a certain substance\nthat they're not getting, the government goes\nwild to make it happen. Like there was a time when we\nall were deficient in iodine, so to fix this the government\nworked with salt makers to just put iodine in salt. So now all of us use it all the time, and we just have enough iodine because there's iodine in all of our salt. I guess what I'm saying here is that most of us check\noff all of our vitamins and mineral needs by living and eating a variety of foods. But, of course, within our\npopulation there are people who can't produce enough\nof a certain vitamin, or like this YouTuber who just ate chicken\ntenders every single day. I mean they should probably\ntake some vitamins. You have to eat a variety of foods to get all your vitamins and minerals. And luckily here in the 21st century we have a test to find out\nhow you're doing on this. It's a blood test. They take your blood, they test it, and they find out how you're\ndoing on vitamins and minerals, and what you might be deficient in, and thus what supplements\nmight actually work for you. And yet 252 million Americans are popping $53 billion worth\nof supplements every year, and most of them probably don't\nneed to be taking anything. Okay, so if I don't need all this, but I'm taking a fistful\nof vitamins every day, where does it all go? - You're just peeing\nout all of the excess. And it might give you\nglow in the dark urine, which is pretty cool, but it's a large waste of your dollars. - Here's a full disclosure\nthat may be surprising to you. I take vitamins and supplements sometimes. I got sent this green\npowder from a sponsor who's thinking about sponsoring\na video on the channel, and I totally drank it every day. It's a vitamin supplement. It has a billion different vitamins in it. And I was like \"Maybe I need one of these \"even though my blood\ntest doesn't say I do, \"what if I actually do? \"What if it's actually gonna help?\" And I tell you that to let you know that this isn't easy. This is not an easy thing to navigate. We were hit with all of these messages of improve your mental\nclarity, increased energy. And you're just like\n\"Is any of this real?\" What I'm finding is\nthat most of it is not. But what to me is ethically wrong is when people turn to supplements because they've been lied to or because they don't trust or can't afford other forms of treatment. In other words, when they're desperate. - Surveys of American sentiment show that pharmaceutical companies have lower approval ratings than Congress, which is, that's pretty bad. And, again, in many ways rightly so. The profiteering off medications is, in my opinion, quite unethical. - So we hate pharmaceutical companies for good reason, maybe, but we suddenly trust\nsupplement companies? We trust vitamins, and the industry that makes them? Okay, so just quick recap. Supplements are the wild\nwest in the United States. They've been very poorly regulated. The industry's gone wild. They can make these wild claims. And a lot of us are\nmaybe wasting our money, and peeing out supplements\nthat we don't need. Is that the scope of the problem here, just that we're wasting our money and we're being falsely advertised to? Doesn't seem that bad. (dramatic music) That is until you realize that not all supplements are harmless. The law says that supplements\nshould be regulated like food, but they aren't food. There's a lot of complicated work that goes into creating a\nhigh quality, safe supplement. It's a complex process of manufacturing, making sure that the substances are pure, the dosage is correct, and it can go wrong very easily. - 23,000 people a year, in\nfact, go to the emergency room after taking a supplement. - Supplement makers don't have to prove that their products are safe. - It was unbelievable what we found. - [Reporter] False and\nunsubstantiated claims. - Remember L-Tryptophan back in the 80's people were taking it, and they were thinking it was\ngonna help with their insomnia and helping them lose weight, and yet it caused thousands of illnesses and dozens of deaths. One of the big problems with that was likely due to contamination\nwithin the supplement, not necessarily the substance itself. A few years ago there was\na supplement that came out that was supposed to\nregulate blood circulation, but it ended up having lead in it. It caused all sorts of lead poisoning, and two deaths. A few years later, the FDA seized 300,000 dietary supplements because they had an excessive\namount of lead in them. That was from one corporation. The FDA isn't monitoring\nall of these supplements, but luckily scientists are. There's this 2018 study that found that 92% of the\nsupplements that they studied had bacterial contamination, and 87% had fungal contamination, which can be really\ndamaging for your body. I'm not gonna go down a\nwhole literature review here because there's so much of this. Let's just say there's a lot of instances of supplements being\nfound to be contaminated. (dramatic music) Okay, let me just tell\nyou one more example here that is just such a good\nexample of the abuse of the lack of regulation here. There's this one plant called Kratom. I don't know, here in the\nUS I like feel like I see it everywhere, in every strip mall. It's like Kratom Signs. It's made from this evergreen tree leaf, and it's sold in the form of powder and pills and extracts. It sounds totally natural and fresh, and I can see why it's\ndoing so well on the market. But, once again, Kratom has been linked to hundreds of cases of\nsalmonella poisoning, and there's the fact that\nit's highly addictive, especially to those who\nhave had opioid addictions, which is, if you haven't heard, a giant problem in our country. It has been deemed to\nbe the cause of death for 91 people who had\noverdoses in 2016 and 2017, though only seven of\nthose people were found to only have kratom in their body. There were other drugs\nin the overdose as well. But what we're saying here is that this can be dangerous stuff. It's not just food like\nthe law wants it to be. The FDA urged the DEA to classify this as a schedule one drug, which is the classification for heroin, but it's a dietary supplement just down the road at the\nlocal convenience store. Speaking of drugs, some\nsupplements are kind of just like drugs in disguise. - So what we're really seeing is that in a lot of those cases they're putting in synthetic drugs, which sometimes are prescription drugs, and sometimes are products that are not approved by the FDA. - One study found that\nover the last decade more than 750 supplements were\nillegally spiked with drugs. Only half of them were ever recalled. Wait, why can they do this? Why can they just put\ndrugs, illegal drugs, into supplements? Ah, because of this law. This law that the industry\nhelped pass in the 90's that says that none of this has to get\nany approval from the FDA. The FDA only steps in\nwhen something goes wrong, when the damage is already done. So backwards. And these companies can\nget pretty aggressive. A few years ago, the\nacademics who revealed that these supplement companies were spiking their\nsupplements with illegal drugs got sued by one of these companies, a company called\nHigh-Tech Pharmaceuticals. The company ended up losing the lawsuit, but what it revealed is that this company had been selling a product that they had been ordered\nto stop selling, to recall, and they just never did. There's so little\noversight happening here. And, again, it's a giant\nindustry, with a lot of money and a lot of products, and it's an FDA that is very\nsmall, with very little money, and not a lot of authority to do much. And as we mentioned at the\nvery beginning of the video, when researchers went in and just popped open some of these bottles and studied the pills, they found that a lot of these supplements don't actually have\nwhat they say they have. They're a totally different substance, but none of us know because you don't know what calcium tastes like. - Literally there have been studies that have shown some supplements have no detectable amount of\nthe thing that it says is supposed to be in there. - No detectable amount. And then we've got good old melatonin. I love melatonin when I need it. That gummy that helps us all\nget a good night's sleep. But it's not a sleeping pill, right? Because it's like natural. - [Reporter] Melatonin\npoisonings in children have been on the rise\nover the past decade. - Well actually melatonin\nis not a vitamin, it is a hormone that\nyou naturally produce. It helps induce sleep. And it's kind of been trending\nover the last few years, especially among children. Over the past decade,\nthe number of children who have overdosed on\nmelatonin went up 530%, causing kids to experience symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. A lot of that is because\nof dosage problems. In some cases they found that the dose is 50% higher\nthan what was on the label. - [Reporter] The US Food\nand Drug Administration doesn't have any control\nof the ingredients or the accuracy of dosage claims. - We talked to one guy\nwho started a Reddit forum because he was taking Lions Mane, which is a mushroom supplement, and it was causing a mysterious illness. He thought it was going to give him energy and mental clarity like\nit says on the bottle, but instead what he experienced\nwas heart palpitations, sleepless nights. - I couldn't sleep for\neight months straight. By that I say one more than\none or two hours a night. - When he started the subreddit, he found thousands of others who reported a whole host\nof neurological issues, chronic tension headaches,\na lack of emotion. One user's husband took his life after not being able to sleep, having constant panic attacks, and losing his job over it. He was 43. - I'd been to the hospital about 20 times the first two months. I have seen basically every specialist that I could get ahold of, and really nobody could\ntell me what was going on. - These people come to Reddit because they don't have any answers. They bought a supplement\nthat looked legitimate, promising mental clarity, and focus and energy, and had their lives completely changed. That's because our government failed. We have a government to protect us against exactly these types of things. But instead people are turning\nto Reddit to find answers. To me this is the most atrocious\nversion of supplements. We actually reached out to the FDA as a part of this story to\nunderstand what's the deal? Why is it like this? And they responded, and we scheduled an interview. We were gonna discuss dietary supplements and regulation in the United States, but then the day before the interview they canceled our meeting, and then just ghosted us. Luckily we have clips of former FDA commissioners\ntalking about this, and they all seem to agree\nthat this is a problem of authority and resources. - Will the FDA ever\nregulate this industry? - We tried. (gentle music) - So, what can be done here? Well, luckily we live in a system where we can make change by changing laws. Like in the 90's we almost did this. If the Congress had\ngiven the FDA more power we would have stricter punishments for supplement companies\nwho break the rules. We would have better rules\naround what they can sell, and what claims they can make. - We should at least be able to agree that all the companies\nshould have to prove that they don't have bacterial\nor fungal contamination, that they don't have heavy metals, that they're not containing\nprescription drugs, and that they do contain the product in the dose that's specified in the pills that they're putting on their label. - I would like purity, and that people know what they're getting. I mean we owe it to\nconsumers at the very least that if you're gonna choose to buy it you should at least know\nwhat you're getting. That seems like the bare minimum, and right now that's not the case. - The experts we talked to don't think that supplements should\nbe regulated like drugs. I think that makes sense. But they agree that we should start with giving the FDA the authority and the resources it needs to monitor supplements so we\nknow what's actually in them, so that we're not\ntrusting the honor system of for-profit companies to obey the rules, and to actually put in these supplements what they say is in these supplements. This would mean the FDA going and conducting spot checks more often and more aggressively to make sure that this stuff is correct, and that it's being\nmanufactured in a clean way, free of contamination. Congress has recently considered a bill that would help with this, including trying to create a database of all the supplements so that the FDA at least\nknows what's on the market. But, of course, the supplement\nlobby's not gonna stand back. They spend over $2 million\na year on lobbying, making sure that things\nstay the way they are. They make a lot of money off it. So, if you are one of the many millions who take a bunch of supplements, and are not sure if they're\nspiked with weird stuff, or if you even need them, what do you do? And the answer is go\nget your blood tested, and just see if you're\ndeficient in anything, if you actually need a dietary supplement. And even if your blood test comes back and you don't need anything, I believe that people should be able to consume whatever they want, even if it's not scientifically proven. You know your body, you\nshould be able to take whatever vitamin or mineral\nyou feel is working for you. I just think that when you\nhave a for-profit industry that is free to mislead and deceive and prey on consumers, you get a bunch of bad situations like the ones we've talked about here. So until the government steps in to help us navigate this, we're kind of on our own. I'm gonna put some\nlinks in the description to third party websites that you can go to to look up your supplements, the specific supplements, and see if they've passed\na high quality standard to know if at least you're getting what it says on the bottle. So that's where we're at with supplements. We're here waiting for\ntransparency and accountability, and above all waiting for the regard of others' wellbeing over\nthe interests of an industry that seems to care more about\nprofit than about our health.

    "captions": "(gun fires) - Jesus. (camera operator laughs) - [Shooting Instructor] Your finger. - What just happened? (ambient music) I'm in Switzerland, and there's\na big festival going on. (ambient music) Everyone has the day off. They're all gathering to have\na good time to celebrate guns. (gun fires) It's a shooting competition for teenagers, and they've been doing\nthis for hundreds of years. - (speaking foreign language)\n- (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] It used to just be boys, but now it's boys and girls, and the winner is deemed the\nking or queen of shooting. - [Interviewer] (speaking\nforeign language) - (speaking foreign language) - [Interviewer] (speaking\nforeign language) - (speaking foreign language) - [Interviewer] (speaking\nforeign language) - (speaking foreign language) (ambient music) - [Johnny] Switzerland is a\npeaceful, neutral country, and yet it is full of guns. The government gives its citizens guns and trains them how to shoot. Every village is required to have access to a shooting range. - We have almost as many guns per head or per person here as in America. - Back home in the United States, we also have a lot of guns, but the culture around\nguns is a little different. - [Ronald Reagan] The right of the people to keep and bear arms\nshall not be infringed. - The country of Switzerland proves that there's no need for more gun rules. - Guns are the number one cause of death among children in the United States, yet we don't have the will to stop it. - Switzerland has the\nlowest crime rate in Europe. - That's all we have at this\npoint, God and our guns. - I really want to get to the bottom of this gun culture thing, why these two countries\nhave such vastly different relationships with guns. So I delved deeper than I usually delve and found myself digging\nthrough old literature from Scottish political philosophers and looking into the\nconstitutional archives, talking to Second Amendment experts, talking to military historians from Switzerland and it's finally all clicked for me and I want to share that with you. So buckle up for what is\ngoing to be a wild ride through history and an\nadventure through Switzerland. (ambient music) So as a side note to this\nstory, I've been finding a lot of bunkers in Switzerland, which if you all remember, a year ago from right now, I\npublished a video about all of the bunkers hiding in Switzerland. And now that I'm here again,\nI find myself stumbling upon more and more bunkers. Anyway, I also want to\ntell you that my trip here to Switzerland and my ability to go around and shoot at shooting ranges\nand spend months diving into Swiss history is made possible because of our generous sponsors who come back month after month\nto support our journalism. BetterHelp, who's the sponsor of today's video is a platform that is making therapy\nmore accessible to people. Normally what you do when you want a therapist is\nyou like call around, you see if like a therapist has availability. Here in the United States,\nyou like check to see if like your insurance\nworks with that therapist. You wait a few weeks, you schedule back and forth over the phone, and then maybe you see a therapist. And if they're not a good\nfit, like good luck, you have to do it again. With BetterHelp, you basically sign up, you fill out a survey, the\nsurvey then matches you with somebody in their giant network. They have a huge network\nof like tens of thousands of like licensed therapists. They'll connect you with one that they think is a good fit for you and you can start communicating\nwith them right away. You can talk by phone, you\ncan talk by video chat, or you can just do like chatting back and forth over a text message. You get to decide that. If you don't like your therapist, you can change your therapist. I went to therapy not because I had a clinical\ndiagnosis like depression or anxiety, but because I'm a human who has stressful things\nin my life and has a lot of inner voices telling me how\nI should think about myself and some of those voices aren't very nice, and I wanted to understand my inner self and understand my mind\nand start to retrain it. That's what therapy is and it has changed my life in huge ways. So I'm really grateful that BetterHelp is making\ntherapy more accessible to people via the internet.

Let's get back to the video. I'm in beautiful Switzerland,\nhere, shooting guns and learning a lot about firearms. Let's go. (intense music) There's the shooting range and\nthe targets are on this side. Oh yeah, there's the targets. (gun fires) Oh, I hear them. Holy smoke. So they're literally shooting\nover the road right there. Oh God, those people. Geez, there are bullets flying\nover our head right now. Oh my God. That is such a weird feeling. Headed to a shooting competition right now at this shooting range surrounded by beautiful Swiss mountains. The sound of these guns. My\ngod, it's like a war zone. Oh wow. - [Patrick] But this,\nbut it's only six rounds. - [Johnny] Yeah. - [Patrick] Because it's single loaded so you always have to, (gun cocks) - [Johnny] You always\nhave to cock it, yeah. - [Patrick] Then you can\nmake it wider and smaller. - Yeah.\n- And you can even... (gun fires) - As I'm standing here, you realize like the cars are right there. You could easily shoot\nthem if you wanted to, if you were standing up. Like I knew that this existed. I saw the Tom Scott\nvideo a few months ago. I thought it was like there\nwas one crazy shooting range in Switzerland that goes over a road. I didn't realize it was common. It's a friendly competition.\nIt's all very wholesome. You see these young kids that are like keeping score,\ntabulating all of the results. I've been hanging out\nwith the president of one of these shooting clubs trying to understand a little bit\nbetter about what this event and things like this represent\nfor these communities. - The military law tells all\nthe villages that they need to provide a shooting range\nor a possibility to shoot. - We got the ammo, military\nprovided at a discount. - [Patrick] Just try again. So you're right-handed? - Yep, I'm right-handed. Is\nthere a telescope in there? Like how am I seeing that far down? - No, there's no telescope.\n- There's no telescope. Oh, that's what makes it. - You're not allowed to\nuse any sights, any optics at any competitions in Switzerland. - Okay, so you're gonna\nmake sure I don't hit any of these cars. - Yeah. Now you're not able\nto see any cars anymore? - Nope, no more cars. - [Patrick] Okay, so no more cars. No more problems about that? - [Johnny] Yes. - Maybe, yeah, move a\nlittle bit further, yeah. You're ready? - Yeah, I think I'm ready. (gun cocks)\n- Whoa. - Now it's loaded. It's ready to shoot. - Oh my God. Okay. - Target 19.\n- Target 19. Here we go. (gun fires) - Very slow. Now you\npulled all the way through. - Oh, I did. Yes.\n- Yeah, exactly. - Yes, I forgot about that. - That's why normally\nwe train how that works. But you hit the target. - I hit the target, that's good. Okay. - You can actually hit the target. (gun fires)\nThat's good. - Oh, there we go.\n- Now we saw it. - I'm getting better. As I shot in my first gun\ncompetition, I was surprised that my instructor kept telling me to relax, to breathe, to turn inward. (gun fires)\n- Exactly. - Yeah, that felt way more relaxed. - [Patrick] Now hit the 10.\n- Oh, there we go. - Here we go. - Wow. I turned inward,\nrelaxed, and I hit the 10. Sharpshooter over here. Wow. This is addictive. I definitely see, I'm like,\nI could do this all day. - So this is like relaxing\nor calming down for me. Sometimes I feel like I'm\ngoing into another world. You turn your focus from focusing outside,\nyou're focusing inside. - Wow. This is fun. Objectively, this is just fun. And it's beautiful. I'm like looking at the Swiss\ncountryside. It's great. My experience with guns as a kid, I would go out into the forest and like blow up like glass\nbottles with shotguns. - [Patrick] That's what what\nI think America is all about. - Wow, that was awesome. I\nkind of wanna shoot again. I never thought I'd say this. I'm not a gun person, but I'm like, I kind of want to like shoot more. Like, this is so fun. I was struck by how\npeaceful and celebratory and wholesome this all was. So much different than\nthe way guns are presented in the USA. So how did we get here? (ambient music) The story of Switzerland starts here. Well, actually down there at that lake in a little green valley where a group of people came together and made a promise to each other 700 years ago. And with that promise came a myth. The hero's name was William Tell and legend has it that one day he refused to bow down to the king's local leader. It was a daring act of disrespect. So as punishment, the overlord forced him to shoot an apple off his own son's head. Tell aimed his crossbow\ncarefully and released. He made the perfect shot. He continued to defy the ruler and eventually inspired the tribes in this region to launch a rebellion. Tell eventually shot the ruler dead and the rebels would go on to win their independence,\nbanding together to start the Confederacy that\nwould become Switzerland. They first made an agreement that they would protect one another, but instead of forming a\nfull-time standing army run by a king, they would arm and train ordinary people to fight. So not an army at all,\nbut rather a militia. I'm now going into a shooting range that is in the mountain\nin a dugout bunker. Very Swiss. (upbeat music) It feels like the old bunker\ndays, exploring a bunker but I am in a shooting range. Mind-blowingly big. It's like a maze in the mountain with just a bunch of rooms shooting. (upbeat music) Okay, so now I'm fully loaded. Safety off. I'm gonna take safety off. - Yeah, if you are on the target. If you are on the target and you wanna shoot, you\ncan take the safety off. - Okay. (gun fires) Shooting in the bunker is a completely different experience. Like you feel the vibration\nof your entire body 'cause the echo is so extreme. I'm getting better at shooting. (gun clicks) (gun fires) (gun clicks)\n(gun fires) Oh my God. (gun clicks)\n(gun fires) Oh my God. Oh yeah. (gun clicks) (gun fires) (gun clicks) (gun fires) - [Shooting Instructor] You\nnever shot before, right? - No. Two days ago, I started. So back to 1600s Europe, where Switzerland remained\nthis one peaceful confederacy protected by its citizen militia. Meanwhile, in the rest of Europe, greedy kings were using\ntheir huge standing armies to conquer one another while Switzerland stood by training its citizens\nin the ways of war. Swiss citizens got so good at fighting that the Pope hired them\nas his personal protectors. Other empires would\neven hire Swiss soldiers to fight their own wars. But Switzerland itself\nremained almost entirely out of these conflicts on the continent. Eventually, European thinkers start to notice this peculiar Alpine\nConfederacy, Switzerland, this place that trains\ntheir citizens to fight and miraculously showed that you can have a republic\neven in Europe, a sea of monarchy and kings. I've been reading a lot of like old European political literature and you start to see this phrase pop up to describe how Switzerland defends itself using a well-regulated militia. I saw this term a lot when I was looking through this old literature. Around 1610, this British\ndiplomat goes to Switzerland and gawks at their well-regulated militia, how they can overturn their\ngovernment at pleasure because they all know how to fight. By the way, back in like the 1600s well-regulated militia\nmeant like a well-organized or efficiently run\nmilitia, not like regulated in the way that we think of it today, but yeah, the idea was if you\narm everyone in your society and you train them,\nthat's actually the key to the best defense and\nthe best preservation of freedom for the\npeople, not just the king. This idea of a\nwell-regulated militia spread across the ocean to a group\nof British intellectuals who were secretly conspiring\nto overthrow their own king. In 1776, they declared independence using their own well-regulated militia to fight off a tyrannical\nking and his standing army. As they fought this war, a\nleader from Switzerland wrote to Benjamin Franklin suggesting that this new rebel experiment\ncalled the United States should become Sister\nRepublics with Switzerland. The Americans somehow won this war and got to work designing\ntheir new country. They sat down in a hot\nchurch looking building to draft the document that would be the foundation\nof this experiment. A system free of kings. The founders studied the political systems of Greece and Rome. They studied the British Magna Carta, Native American confederacies,\nEuropean philosophers. But then there's John\nAdams, one of the founders who was kind of obsessed with\nSwitzerland at this time. He studied their system and he was amazed at how their militia worked, how they required everyone to\nhave a gun and to have ammo and they wouldn't let them\nget married unless they did. He wrote all about this in like a treaties on different government systems right before he wrote the Constitution with his fellow co-founders. Switzerland was a model. It was the republic that\nhad resisted tyranny and been able to stay free\nin a Europe full of kings. And when it came time to\nwrite the actual constitution, you can see that a militia was enshrined in the Constitution itself. In the Constitution, the\nrole of the militia is to protect the government,\nto protect the country from invasion or insurrection. And then after the Constitution,\nit became time to draft that sacred list of the\nmost fundamental rights that would ensure that the\nAmerican project remained free and full of liberty. The first of these 10 amendments\nwould be freedom of speech and of expression, assembly,\nreligion, and the press. But right after that, they\nwrite the Second Amendment and it's about the well-regulated\nmilitia being vital, being necessary for the\nsecurity of a free country. So to have a militia, the\npeople must have arms. They must have a right to have guns. So now you have the\nConstitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Second Amendment and then a few years later, the well-regulated militia\nidea got enshrined in law when one of the first congresses\npassed a law that said that every man doesn't just\nhave the right to have a gun, but is required to have a gun and ammo and must train to use it so\nthat the president could call on its armed citizens as\nits mechanism for defense. This whole legal framework\nwas very clearly like, yes, you can have guns,\nbut only if you are ready to use them to defend our country from invasion or insurrection. And sure enough, George Washington\nhad to actually use this. There was this rebellion\nin Pennsylvania over taxes, and George Washington\ncalled up his armed citizens to march and clamp down on these rebels and it totally worked. The militia system was\nworking for this young nation to ensure its freedoms\nwith an armed citizenry, something Switzerland had\nbeen doing for centuries. Guns started out as a symbol\nof collective security, as collective defense,\narmed citizens ready to stand up to defend the country. But needless to say,\nthings kind of changed when it came to guns in America. So how we got from that to this is the next part of this video. And in my mind, it's the\nmost interesting version of this story because it\nshows us how Switzerland and the United States diverged so severely from this militia culture. Okay, but before we get to that, I want to show you more about Switzerland today. Show you what it looks\nlike when a country sticks to an actual militia system as their primary tool for\nnational defense. Okay. (mellow music) To better understand gun ownership in Switzerland, I visited\na member of the Swiss Army. - Hey, how you doing?\n- Nice to meet you. Hey, can I see your gun? - Of course. That's why you came. - That's why I'm here. - You want to play some Where's Waldo? Where's the assault rifle? - Oh my gosh, I already see it. You used to have a gun\nin your corner here. - You wanna carry it? - Okay. What's interesting to me is like for you, this is like no big deal, for me, this is a giant gun. Like this is like, I don't handle guns. Like I held a gun like this for the first time like two days ago, for the very first time in my life.\n- No way. - Yes, actually I'm an American. - Yeah, that's very uncliche. - Switzerland still has a militia. Every able-bodied man in\nSwitzerland is given a uniform and a gun and required\nto join the military. - And this is in the constitution. It's written there that\nevery male can be forced, not only forced to do military service, but also forced to make more. So instead of 21 weeks, I did 37 weeks and in total, I have to do like 450 days. - Up until the nineties,\nyou would go to jail if you refused to do this. Now you just have to pay 3%\nof your income if you don't, - I was also very against the military and I went reluctantly. - One of the first things you do in this initial training is\nyou come to one of these clubs and you learn to shoot. - It was kind of scary actually, because it's all like\n18 to 20-year-old guys and just like, oh yeah, we're gonna go to shoot this gun now. And it's like, here's\nammunition, here's the rounds and now you do what you learned. - After the recruits complete\ntheir training, they return back to their normal jobs,\nto their normal lives, but they keep their firearm\nwith them in their home. And then they're required to come to one of these private clubs every\nyear to practice shooting. - (speaking foreign language) - It's called the obligatories. So it's obligatory or\nmandatory for people to shoot. - This is my shooting book. You know, every time I shoot, there is like a little report,\nsomebody has to sign it. Of course when you go shooting,\nyou just take this out and then it's just like this. - Wow. - And you go to the public\ntransport just like that. - You're just walking around\non the train with your guns. - Yeah.\n- Really? - So it's actually similar to what the United States National\nDefense Strategy looked in like the 1800s where every\nable-bodied man had a gun and was required to use\nit, required to be ready to defend the country from\ninvasion or insurrection. - Part of this is also being able to fight if it will be necessary just to, you know, protect our country. And this, you know,\nself-defense thinking is part of, you know, our people from Switzerland. - What Switzerland\ndoesn't have that we have in the United States\nis a Second amendment, a articulated, unambiguous\nright to have guns. Instead, guns are articulated mostly as a duty to protect the country. And then secondly comes\nthe privilege to use guns, to compete with them,\nto own guns, et cetera. For them, the duty came first. - We have a tradition, more\nof a liberty tradition, and there it's more of a\nresponsibility tradition. - Essentially, everybody has to go. So this is kind of like one thing that unifies a lot of\nthe male population here. And it's just like you can meet a guy and if he is done military\nservice as well, you can talk for hours and hours and hours. - And this to me, makes\nall the difference, like these two different\npurposes of guns in society, whether they are a right for individuals or the duty of the collective. I think this is a major factor that divides these two gun cultures. If you could describe Swiss\nshooting culture in three words, what would those words be? - (speaking foreign language) - And this is where it all clicked for me. I had thought that Switzerland's\ngun culture was the product of smart laws and gun policies. But being here, it was becoming clear that it was the militia system that was at the root of all of this. The requirement for every\nman to learn how to shoot as the main strategy for\ncollective national defense, turning guns into a symbol\nof community and celebration. The center of large festivals\nall over the country, where Swiss traditions are celebrated with firearms at the center, like that teen shooting competition in Zurich, or this important shooting festival that takes place at the foot of the Alps along a beautiful Swiss lake. The place where the founders of Switzerland formed\ntheir confederacy in 1291. - (speaking foreign language) - You have so many members\nof the community coming out and participating in them. You're gonna have fun.\nThe shooting is fun. They'll have music. After you're done shooting,\nyou can have some beer or wine and it's a family affair\nand so they kept that alive. - (speaking foreign language) - Okay, we're at yet another gun club, and once again, this gun club has a target that goes right over the top of a highway. I'm here to continue to learn what the deal is with Swiss gun culture and to see if I can get a better\nscore than I did last time. Okay, so this is the gun\nwe're shooting today. Gonna give it a go here. Oh, there's a kick.\nThere's a kick on this one. (gun cocks) Okay, here it goes. (gun fires) - Wow. Geez. Okay, man, the sound like\nechoes through the valley. (gun fires) Okay. (gun fires) Beginner's luck continues. Wow. (gun fires) Oh, here comes the score. My scorecard. Okay, what do we have here? - (speaking foreign language) - It's the beginner's\nluck. Beginner's luck. This is my scorecard here. My moosh, what's it called? Moosh.\n- Moosh. - I got the moosh. Yes, so 300 meters away. I think that this bullet just traveled across the valley over the cars and hit a thing that's this\nbig is pretty satisfying. So while I'm sitting here\nshooting bullseyes right below us, not only are other cars, but there's a guy just mowing the lawn. Like there's a guy mowing\nthe lawn right there under the shooting range. This place is at once super buttoned up when it comes to guns and\nseemingly very relaxed, but it's not relaxed. As I visit these gun clubs, it's striking how much these feel like a magnet for community, a gathering\nplace for the community, a collective activity and competition that everyone in the community can enjoy. I'm so used to guns being\nassociated with danger and division and politics and fear, but here it just has such\na different feel than what I'm used to. Thank you so much. I really\nappreciate your time. Thank you. This is really good. It's been a really enlightening experience visiting all these shooting ranges. And what it's taught me is that guns here in Switzerland\nare a totally different thing than they are in America. Like they're a completely\ndifferent symbol. They have a very different purpose. They have a very different meaning. And that's kind of surprising to me because remember that the\nUnited States was founded on a lot of the same\nparadigms as Switzerland when it came to having a militia and having firearms in society as a form of collective defense. So to understand how\nthese two gun cultures so greatly diverged despite\nhaving similar roots, you have to understand what happens after the Constitution,\nafter the Second Amendment. - I have the right to\nprotect my family and myself. (gun fires) - What do you think about\nAmerican gun culture? Like what's the view?\n- (beep) bonkers. The fact that everybody\nhas a gun in America. It would make me feel uneasy. And I'm used to being in the proximity of guns because I'm allowed a gun. I don't know how you guys do it. - And if he tries to take\nour guns, he can take them from our cold, dead hands. - There has been a\nshooting at a synagogue. - Get off of my porch right now. - Gun control, all it's\ngonna do is take the guns out of the people that obey the law. - Three people were killed in\nJacksonville, Florida today after what appears to be a\nracially motivated hate crime. - [Johnny] So after its\nindependence, the US quickly learned that while a militia is\ngreat for defense, deterrence and neutrality, it is not\ngood for one thing, conquest. Beginning in the 19th century, the US expanded west very quickly. They fought other European colonists and Native Americans for their land. They would eventually fight\neach other in a civil war. These kinds of operations were too big for militias made up of everyday citizens. Instead, they needed to establish and fund a centralized,\nprofessional standing army. And this was just the beginning. By the time the 1900s rolled\naround, the US had grown into something that Switzerland never was and probably never will\nbe, an expansionist empire using its sprawling permanent military to wield influence around the globe. By the middle of the century,\nit would become the largest and most powerful military\nto have ever existed. Because the US had a huge\nstanding army, it did away with a lot of the original\nlaws requiring people to join the militia. And now without a duty to form a militia to protect the country from invasion and insurrection like the\nConstitution said, they were left with just the second half\nof this amendment, the right to bear arms and how it\nshould not be infringed. Guns started to become more\nof a personal tool, a tool to pursue their American dream, to hunt, to protect their family, to exterminate. - It's more like the Rambo style. It's not like, I'm going\nshooting at the target. You don't go shooting\nsomewhere in the woods or in the forest, you just don't do that. You go to a shooting range and\nyou get part of the community and then your goal is not just to, you know, shoot wherever there is. So your goal is to get better. And your goal is not just to shoot around. - [Johnny] Guns continued to\ntake on a more personal symbol in the sixties and seventies when more and more Americans were losing\ntrust in their government. This was also right at the time when crime was skyrocketing in America. Without this duty for collective\ndefense, guns became more and more a symbol of personal defense from all of this crime, personal liberty and a symbol of this growing\nanti-government sentiment. And as a result, the number of guns in America soared. The NRA, which remember\nafter the Civil War started as a largely non-political\ngroup that was meant to just help Americans be more responsible and better marksmen, they got\ntaken over in the seventies by a group of hardliners who wanted to change the agenda of the NRA, turning into a political lobbying\ngroup that was set on reshaping the way Americans thought about the Second Amendment and making sure that no legislation ever made it through that curtailed gun rights. They began pushing an interpretation\nof the Second Amendment that was about individual\nprotection, a right to bear arms so that you can protect yourself. And trying to de-emphasize the connection to a well-regulated militia as the purpose for this right to bear arms. - In the face of this relentless onslaught of gun control schemes, you're the reason the Second\nAmendment still stands. You're the tip of the spear. - You're the ones that make it possible for us every day to defend this freedom. - And it totally worked. The Second Amendment became\nmore and more a guarantee that everyone can have\nguns to protect themselves and their family having nothing to do with protecting the country. After all, we had the biggest\nmilitary in the world. We didn't need a militia anymore. - [Announcer] Don't let\nHillary leave you protected with nothing but a phone. The NRA Political Victory\nFund is responsible for the content of this advertising, - This interpretation of guns and the Second Amendment would\nbecome solidified in a five to four vote in the Supreme Court in 2008 when the court ruled that the Second Amendment\nguaranteed people to have guns, even when those\nguns have no relationship to an armed militia. So this is why the United\nStates has more guns than any country on Earth\nbecause the courts have ruled that guns are an individual\nright, a right to bear arms. Every year, 20,000\nmurders occur with a gun. Thousands of children and\nteens are killed with a gun. Hundreds of deaths are caused\nby gun accidents, hundreds of mass shootings and of course, the leading\ncause of gun violence, suicides. Tens of thousands of lives taken with guns but we can't seem to do much about it because as long as guns\nremain an individual right now deeply woven into\nAmerican identity, any effort to try to pass reasonable laws, to try to limit these countless\ndeaths that we have in our country will\ncontinue to fail especially as the NRA continues to politicize guns, to use them to divide\nAmerica, to scare America, and to make us feel like\nwe need guns to be safe. - The facts are on our\nside. Guns save lives. - And you'll never stop us\nfrom defending our families. - [Johnny] My last visit\nwas an important one to this gun shop where the owner is Swiss, but is a card carrying member of the NRA and a big fan of American Gun Culture. I had to get his take on this. - These are the best\nassault rifles in the world. - Really?\n- These are, yes. - Wow. What what makes them so good? Why are they so good? - They're Swiss made. (laughs) Any questions? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. You don't need to say anymore. What do you feel when you\nlook at American gun culture? - It's very interesting. From the gun system, from the gun laws, I would\nlike to live in the States but not with all the dumbasses around. I don't know why there are\nso many deaths, accidents with firearms and here, nothing. I don't know why. Why all the US Citizens so stupid and let a loaded firearm\nthere on the table with kids 1, 2, 3 years old. I don't know why. You need some rules. Our government, they\nsupport shooting clubs. They do support ammo. They support shooting ranges. They support the guys who are\ngoing to a shooting range. You need rules. You need to have it. - Yeah. (ambient music) So here's my conclusion in all of this. I went into this story thinking that I was gonna tell a policy story like how different policies\nwould affect gun culture and it totally took a different route because I learned sort of halfway through that guns are a symbol. They're a symbol. Yes, they're a weapon. Yes, they're a sports tool, but they're also a symbol for\nthe people who wield them. The way we see guns is deeply influenced by the stories and the\nmyths of our societies. Switzerland and the United\nStates have two very different stories and because of that, they have two very\ndifferent gun cultures. For Switzerland, having armed\ncitizens who are trained with weapons is what kept\nthem neutral and safe as a group, as a collective. The United States admired\nthis and tried to copy it and they did for a while but soon the demands of an\nexpanding empire allowed that vision to fade and turned the meaning of guns into something\ndifferent, making it a right for individuals to protect themselves. Most guns in America are\nnot used to protect people. That's not what they're used for. They're often used at a\nshooting range or hunting or to end someone's life. And yet to the people who\nhold fast to their firearms as a right, they feel like any change to that, any legislation to change or to limit those guns is a\ntaking away of their right. So the way I see it, as long as guns are an individual\nright, associated with personal protection\nand personal liberty, not a lot's gonna change in America. We certainly don't stand a chance of having a culture, anything like what we've seen here in Switzerland. And that's a shame to me. That's a shame. (mellow music) Hey, before you go, I need\nto tell you one last thing, which is that we made\nprobably our last batch of the poster that I designed last year. It's a poster called All Maps Are Wrong and I'm very proud of it. It shows all the ways that\nyou can take our earth and project it onto a 2D plane, which always comes with some distortion. Anyway, it's kind of a\nnerdy map lover thing and if you're into\nthat, you should go over and check it out before they're all gone. This is probably gonna be our last batch, so get 'em while they last and\nthe links in the description."

    "title": "Was Henry Kissinger a War Criminal?",
    "video_id": "COqq7862wcU",
    "captions": "- Henry Kissinger, one\nof the most controversial and powerful figures in\nAmerican politics is dead. Kissinger was an American\ndiplomat and political scientist. He served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State\nunder two presidents. And his career is full of a lot, some laudable achievements such as normalizing relations with China, but also full of some actions\nthat many call war crimes. Many of you watching are 100% positive that Henry Kissinger is a war criminal. Others might see Kissinger\nas a brilliant leader who helped the U.S. navigate\nvery uncertain times during the Cold War. I actually met Henry Kissinger once. I was working at a think tank in D.C. where he was a counselor\nand trustee and frankly, I didn't glean much about\nthis guy's character in our little meeting. But since then, we've gotten to know him, at least his career. We've studied him and his actions, both the good and the bad. So today I wanna look at\nthis man, Henry Kissinger. I wanna look at what he did and evaluate what we can learn from this\nperson who, for better or worse has played an influential role in how American power is\nwielded on the global stage. - [Narrator] On this,\nperhaps the most gentle and graceful land in all of Asia, president Nixon and Mr. Kissinger unleashed 100,000 tons of bombs. - Henry Kissinger was born\non May 27th, 1923 in Germany. When he was a teenager,\nhis family left Germany for the United States, fleeing\noppression from the Nazis. He went to Harvard and later\nwas drafted into the Army during World War II, serving\nin a counterintelligence role. After the war, he returned to Harvard and pursued a PhD in political science. Kissinger made a name for himself as a political theorist and author, he focused on the role of nuclear weapons and this new geopolitics that had emerged after World War II. He studied a political\nphilosophy called Realpolitik which emphasizes how countries gain power by reacting practically to\nconflicts and situations as opposed to based on ideology or values. But from my reading what made Kissinger\npowerful was his ability to connect with people, to\nnetwork in Washington D.C. That was perhaps his greatest asset and the thing that kept\nhim close to power. This was later exemplified by\nthe fact that Kissinger served under both Republican and\nDemocratic presidents. You can start to seek\nKissinger's realpolitik and networking skills in full action well before he ever stepped\nfoot in the White House. According to this archived document from Nixon's chief of\nstaff, early in his career when he was working for the\nDemocratic President LBJ as an advisor on Vietnam, he cozied up to the\nDemocrats political opponent Richard Nixon, who was\nrunning for president. So he cozies up to Nixon and conspires to pass Nixon information about secret Vietnam War peace\ntalks happening in Paris. Nixon could potentially\nuse this information that he got from Kissinger\nto prevent the peace talks from going well which in turn would make\nthe Democrats look bad since they were the ones in\npower and help pave the way for Nixon to win the presidency. (dramatic music) Now, there's a significant\ndebate on whether or not all of this sort of backroom\ndeal thing had any impact on the peace talks, but what I care about in this little story is what\nit shows about Henry Kissinger. That he was willing to go to these lengths to betray the president he was working for and to cozy up to a candidate who he hated but thought could potentially\nwin the presidency to pass on information that\ncould potentially compromise the peace talks that might\nend the war in Vietnam. Anyway, the peace talks\ndid indeed break down the day before the\npresidential election, no less. Nixon ended up winning and\nKissinger this political theorist turned power-hungry networker had shown that he was willing to\nsabotage peace talks in the name of gaining favor\nin the eyes of a powerful man. Nixon appointed Kissinger as\nhis national security advisor giving him an unprecedented\nlevel of control, control over what he could\nuse the American power machine to do on the global stage, all in the name of National Security. (dramatic music) Now, listen, most of us\nweren't alive at this time so we don't really know what this was like to live during the 60s and\n70s when kind of everything was about the Cold War\nand specifically Vietnam. (dramatic music) So now you have Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon overseeing this war. It was a war that was no closer to ending. A war that remember, these\ntwo conspired to lengthen, so that together they could end it and score Nixon political points. And this leads us to perhaps the most infamous\nof Kissinger's sins. There's a reason why\nAnthony Bourdain said, \"Once you've been to\nCambodia you'll never stop wanting to beat Henry Kissinger to death with your bare hands.\" That's because in March, 1969, Kissinger directed the U.S. Air Force to fly over Vietnam's neighbor, Cambodia, a neutral third party and\nto drop bombs everywhere. - [Narrator] President\nNixon and Mr. Kissinger unleashed 100,000 tons of bombs, the equivalent of five Hiroshimas. The bombing was their personal decision, illegally and secretly,\nthey bombed Cambodia a neutral country, back to the Stone Age. - The goal was to eliminate\nNorth Vietnamese supply lines and strongholds that were in Cambodia but the response was carpet bombing. Carpet bombing is indiscriminate. It has unknown targets, which means that civilians usually get\ncaught in the crossfire. So now you have B52s raining\ndown hell from the sky at all hours of the day,\nhomes were reduced to rubble. Entire villages were turned\nimmediately into refugees. And what the record\nshows that came out later is that all of this, this\nindiscriminate bombing, this slaughter from above was approved by and then concealed by Henry Kissinger. (calm instrumental music) This map that you're looking at is not some stylized\nrepresentation of this. This is actual data. We have the data of every bomb, hundreds of thousands of bombs that were dropped on\nCambodia during this time. All in all, at least 100,000\nCambodians died in all of this. 2 million were made homeless, and this is in a country\nof only 7 million people. In total, the U.S. dropped 2,756,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia. Many of these bombs went undetonated turning the country into a minefield of undetonated explosives\nthat still exist today and perhaps more\nsignificantly contributing to the destabilizing of this country making way for a violent\ncommunist party to rise to power with a vengeance leading\nto a mass genocide. All of this happened in secret without the approval of\nCongress, it was Henry Kissinger. This one man wielding,\nhis deathly gotten power to ruthlessly get what\nhe wanted at any cost. As the endless war was near its end, peace negotiations kept breaking down. In response, Kissinger sent\nanother round of brutal bombings around Christmas, 1972 in an effort to force the North Vietnamese\nback to the negotiating table. (dramatic music)\n(bombs exploding) And I'm not exaggerating here. Like Kissinger literally said, \"We bombed the North Vietnamese into accepting our concessions.\" Some historians argued that\nthe bombings had little effect on the peace talks, and instead\nonly resulted in more pain, more death, and more destruction. And yet, this is where the\nstory takes an insane turn. The next year, Henry Kissinger\nwas given a Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the ceasefire in Vietnam. An award given to him for ending a war that didn't actually end. An award that his North\nVietnamese counterpart would decline. Two members of the Nobel\nPeace Committee resigned in protests because of this. - It is as if everyone\nat the Olympic Stadium joined in carrying an\nathlete on their shoulders in an endless triumphal procession without pausing to realize that in fact he had won no gold medals at all. - And Kissinger himself\neven felt weird about this and offered to give the\nmedal back to the committee. Okay, this is one of the great\nparodies of the modern era that this ever happened,\nbut it doesn't end here. In Chile, in 1970, Kissinger\ndirected the CIA to destabilize the country and seek to overthrow its recently elected socialist president. The coup attempt failed here,\nbut it eventually did lead to the assassination of a Chilean general. The President was eventually overthrown and replaced by this Chilean general who would go on to kidnap,\nmurder, and torture his political opponents. But because he wasn't a communist, Kissinger turned a blind eye. In fact, one of the\nfeatures of Henry Kissinger during his time was\ncozying up to dictators all around the world, all in the name of\nsecuring America's place as the global superpower. He pledged his support for this\nIndonesian military dictator as he was invading East\nTimor using American weapons. We have this declassified\ndocument of the conversation between Kissinger and\nthis military dictator. Kissinger telling this\nmilitary dictator to move fast on his invasion and to not\nbe too obvious about the fact that he's using U.S. military\nweaponry and support. The dictator did move fast\nand soon was exterminating hundreds of thousands of people, Kissinger and his big\npowerful apparatus standing by to watch what they had sponsored. While illegally bombing Cambodia, Kissinger also oversaw\nillegal bombings in Laos. He supported Pakistan in their\ngenocide against Bangladesh. He supported Turkey as\nthey invaded Cyprus. He helped kick off U.S.\ndependence on Saudi Arabia for oil in exchange for\nselling them weapons, a relationship that we're\nstill bound to today. He supported coups and death squads across Latin America, and the\nlist goes on and on and on. - I won't have it from him that he's doing this against communism. It's just another of the\nconstituents of the gigantic lie that constitutes his reputation. He's a thug and a crook and a liar and a pseudo intellectual\nand a murderer, okay? All of those things are\nfactually verifiable, factually verified. - I mean, listen, it\nwas the Cold War like, again, none of us can really\ncapture what that was like. You had two superpowers racing to see who could get more nuclear weapons. There was real fear here\nand leaders had to make very difficult decisions. Defenders of Kissinger\nsee all of this behavior that I've listed as just a\nleader living in the Cold War, having to do what it takes\nto avoid nuclear conflict or a communist takeover. A vital elder statesman serving America and making impossible\ndecisions along the way. But the most vociferous critics\ntend to see the opposite. An evil genius who was\ngiven the full arsenal of American power, which\nhe then wielded to achieve his grand vision of how\nthe world should look. But when you look at the arc\nof Henry Kissinger's career neither of these characterizations hold. He was not a master strategist\nor an unparalleled genius. In fact, he's a guy\nfull of contradictions. He conspired to extend the Vietnam War despite thinking that the war was foolish. He joined the Nixon White\nHouse, despite long maintaining that Richard Nixon was\nnot presidential material. He orchestrated these\nincreased bombings of Vietnam and Cambodia despite\nall evidence indicating that the U.S. could not win this war. A reminder that Henry\nKissinger grew up being bullied and beaten up for being\na Jew in Nazi Germany and then he fled that brutality\nto come to the United States where he studied how power\nworks between countries, but also between people. He used those skills to navigate himself into standing in the most\npowerful places in the world next to the the most\npowerful people in the world, the most powerful military\nin the world at his disposal and the permission to\nuse it as he saw fit. Henry Kissinger knew what\nit took to stay on top and what it took was shifting alliances, secret bombing campaigns,\nsabotaging peace talks, supporting dictators abroad,\nand the list goes on. I guess the point here is that Henry Kissinger's\nmaster guiding principle was to have no guiding principle. He infused that into his\nleadership, into his decisions, leading to the destruction of\nmany lives around the globe, ripples that are still felt today. Even if Henry Kissinger were still alive, I believe he would never have\nfaced true accountability for his actions. He played the game too well. He's too liked by powerful people on both sides of the aisle. But ultimately, if we can\nlearn anything from this, the death of Henry Kissinger\ngives us an opportunity to appreciate what can\nhappen when too much power is concentrated in the hands of one man.

Built by volunteers and\nstudents and technicians, tinkerers who are repurposing their skills to resist invasion. We partnered with the Kyiv Independent to get a deeper understanding of what this actually looks like. This is their story. And the story of how set they\nare on keeping their country. (gentle music) Not by having bigger weapons,\nbut by having smarter ones. (munition exploding) (tense music) - [Francis] Can you hear me all right? - Yeah, I can hear you. How you doing? This is Francis Farrell, a reporter from Ukraine's largest English language news\noutlet, the Kyiv Independent. They've been covering this war in-depth and they worked with\nus to tell this story. How is Kyiv feeling these days? - It's this kind of tense, waiting period, 'cause everyone's ready\nfor another kind of wave of Russian missile and drone attacks against the energy system. - I wanna hear about your\ntime on the front lines and I wanna hear about drones and just walk me through that story. - 11 o'clock in the\nmorning, we met our contact. We jumped in his car and headed out straight\ntowards the city of Bakhmut, which is now basically in ruins. (somber music) It was pretty quiet, but then we started to get\nhit by Russian shelling, by mortar shelling. You can hear the whistle\ncoming in and the explosion. You can feel it in the ground\nwhen it's really close. And when the time came, a target was acquired and it\nwas time to go out and fly. They had the drone ready\nwith the munition on it. - And what did the drone look like? Can you describe it? - So it's an FPV drone,\nso it's a quadcopter, but it's a very kind of crude designs, and on the bottom you have\nthe actual munition strap. It's actually made from\na helicopter rocket. They cut the rocket part off\nand they just used the warhead. The pilot put on these\ncrazy futuristic goggles and have the controller in his hand. (drone whirring) But at that point, you start to see this\nRussian electronic warfare jamming stuff starting to kick in. So it really is like, \"Oh, the signal's gone.\nOh, now it's back.\" There's a button somewhere that's like, okay, this is where we release the bomb. - So a lot of the drones\nthat they're using in Ukraine actually look a lot like the drones I use when I'm out reporting in the field, which I'm gonna get to in a little bit. I need to tell you about\nsomething, which is spam. Spam, spam, spam has taken\nover all of our lives. Our phones blow up, our email is a mess. Spammers will text you. It's\nall gotten out of control. If you've ever wondered how\nspammers get your information, the answer is they probably bought it.

They know your name,\nyour age, where you live, your phone number, your email\naddress, what you buy online, your browsing history. All of this has been collected and sold around on these massive lists. The good news here is that\nwe have the right to demand that our name and information\nbe taken off these lists. The bad news is that it's really hard and cumbersome to do this and there's like hundreds of lists. All of this brings me to the\nsponsor of today's video, which is Incogni, a tool\nthat I am so grateful exists, because what they do is they go out and they take you off of these lists. You don't have to do anything. You sign up for Incogni, you give them permission\nto act on your behalf, and then they go out and they\nfind the list that you're on and they start demanding\nthat you be taken off. If any of these data brokers push back, Incogni continues to push them\nuntil all of your information is deleted from these lists. I signed up for this a while back when they came to sponsor a video and it has changed my world. My phone doesn't blow up anymore. My email is way more under control and the best part is I\nget to track the progress.

I do the annual plan so that\nthey're constantly monitoring and taking me off these lists. I am really glad Incogni exists and I'm really grateful that\nthey sponsored today's video, that they support our journalism. So with that, let's dive back into this\nvideo about drones in Ukraine. Francis' reporting shows us how this war, the war in Ukraine, is becoming more and\nmore, a war of drones. - That's what this war\nis all about, really. It's this mix of very\nold school brutal tactics of infantry and artillery,\nbut with this high-tech edge, - [Johnny] Some of these\ndrones are military weapons designed for warfare. But more and more we're seeing\ndrones being made in homes and classrooms and DIY\nworkshops around the country by students and volunteers, overnight drone experts who\nbypass the Ukrainian army and send their drones directly to soldiers on the front line. - This is where war\nbecomes really almost scary and futuristic. - [Johnny] To understand how\ndrones became a centerpiece of this war and why engineering students are the ones making them, we have to remember how the war started. - [Speaker] Putin has just\nlaunched a full scale invasion of Ukraine. - Since the beginning of this conflict, Ukraine's biggest\nweakness has been the sky. Russia has a much stronger air force and they quickly\ndeveloped air superiority. This allowed them to\nbetter gather intelligence, support their ground troops,\nand precisely deploy missiles. This was Russia's huge advantage. Ukraine needed a way to fight back, and so they started\nturning to military drones. - [News Anchor] Bayraktar,\nthe Turkish-made weapon Ukrainian officials are touting as one of the most\neffective in their arsenal, that's played a part in slowing\ndown the Russian advance. - [Johnny] But drones like this kind of resemble traditional airplanes. They're easily spotted and shot down by Russia's\nanti-aircraft weapons. They needed to find another way. - They needed eyes in the sky. That's literally how\nthey tell me every time. And so very quickly there was a frenzy to buy DJI civilian drones for hobbyists, for photographers, YouTubers. - This is actually the type of drone that I've always used\nwhen I do my field shoots. And I gotta say, it's a pretty useful tool for the use case of the Ukrainian army. It's light, it's portable, it's cheap, and it's small enough to not\nbe detected by Russian radar. - [Francis] And very\nquickly they figured out how to integrate them\nwith their tactical maps, learned how to jailbreak the software to get around the geoblocking. - Soon you've got Ukrainian soldiers writing back to their families, asking for supplies and bulletproof vests, and more and more, asking for drones. These DJI drones became really useful for helping Ukrainian soldiers have a reconnaissance view from above. They could see the lay of the land. It also helped them more\naccurately pinpoint their targets of these big artillery\nguns they were using. - Immediately became the bread and butter for any Ukrainian unit. And then from there, the innovation just\nreally began to get going. (suspenseful music) - These DJI drones were useful, but they had limits. DJI, which is a Chinese company, is not thrilled about their\ndrones being used in war, especially by the Ukrainians. So they make big efforts to\nblock software and hardware from getting into the country. These drones are also\nvulnerable to Russian jamming. Basically, you can jam the signal, and make these drones basically useless. Also, you can't really\ncustomize a DJI drone that much. Ukrainian soldiers needed to be able to customize their drones more and more as the war progressed. And that led to the rise of the FPV drone. (tense music) These drones are usually used for racing, or for getting shots like this. The strength of the FPV drone is that they're easily put\ntogether with cheap parts and they can be highly customized with a little help from a 3D printer. On the battlefield, Ukrainian soldiers started\ntaking these little FPV drones and strapping explosives to them, carrying it across the front line and then barreling right\ninto a Russian target. These cheap drones became\nthe edge that Ukraine needed to level the playing field in the sky. But there was one major problem. - They get destroyed constantly. And obviously, kamikaze drones are only\nmeant to be used once. They're also a kind of expendable material on the front line. - [Johnny] Soldiers begin\nusing a lot of these things. By one estimate, they're using 10,000 of\nthese drones per month. - And if a unit doesn't get them replaced very, very quickly, they\ncan be in big trouble on their little part of the front line. - [Johnny] And yet the\nflow of drones kept coming. Thanks in part to a widespread\neffort, a grassroots effort, all around the country\nfrom resourceful Ukrainians who saw an opportunity to\napply their technical skills to supporting their country. (gentle music) (speaking foreign language) (drone whirring) - The Kyiv Independent helped us connect with some of these drone makers. They are technicians, engineers,\nsome of them are students, a lot of them are volunteers, and they are the ones keeping these drones flowing to the front lines. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - This guy, Denis Lyubchenko, used the money and infrastructure\nfrom his existing business but redirected it to making drones. (speaking foreign language) - This informal drone economy\nhas cropped up organically and it's widespread. A lot of people are participating in it. But it's outside of the authority of the government or the military. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] It's yet another expression of how Ukrainians are\nresourcefully fighting back in light of their country being invaded by a much stronger power. - So you have IT specialists,\nyou have engineers, and you basically have this nation, which is just very\nexperienced with tinkering and experimenting and coming\nup with solutions on the spot, or really tricky problems. They've got the technical background and now there's motivation. (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) - Very often you see\nfundraisers just scrolling through Instagram Stories\norganized by friends of soldiers who know that there are people\nout there on the front line, they need a drone. - So you have started to see\nthat the tactics of drones on the battlefield are\nevolving really quickly. They're starting to settle\ninto some main tactics that drones are now being\nused for all the time. A first major one is recon\nand intelligence gathering. Drones being undetectable eyes in the sky allow Ukrainian soldiers\nto get a lay of the land in a way that you can't\nreally get any other way, unless you have like a\nfull-blown air force. They're able to track and view their adversary's troop\nmovement, and crucially, they're able to investigate their targets before they try to hit them. When you're shooting\nthese big artillery guns, it's kind of a game of guess and check. You shoot the gun, you\nhope it hits the target, and then if it doesn't, you\nadjust it and try again. When you have a drone\nin the air to observe where that shot actually hits, you can more precisely calibrate your gun so that you're hitting your\ntarget more accurately. But with the rise of FPV drones and all of this customization, you're starting to see drones\nbecome carriers of explosives, bigger and bigger explosives. Just like what Francis saw, a customized explosive\nthat is attached to a drone with a 3D printed quick release, that with the press of a button, can release the explosive\non the desired target. And then of course there's\nthe kamikaze tactic, which is just to strap\nan explosive to a drone and run it right into\na target, like a tank. This effectively turns your cheap drone into a precision guided missile, something that would cost\norders of magnitude more. But as these techniques become\nmore and more sophisticated, so do the counter attacks. Russia counters all of this, not only with drones of their own, they now have fleets of drones that they are using to\nattack Ukrainian cities, but also with electronic warfare, which basically means jamming signals. This whole tactic relies on radio signals that allow a pilot to\nsee where they're flying and to control the drone remotely. Russia is getting better and better at putting out signal jammers to stop pilots from seeing\nand controlling their drone. You can see some of this\ninterference happening in some of these drone feeds. And when your drone looks like that and you can't control it, it\nbasically renders it useless. So to counter this, Ukrainian soldiers now put up drones that are specifically\nmeant to boost their signal to create kind of a\nbridge of a radio signal that will counteract\nthis electronic warfare and secure a more solid signal between the pilot and the drone. The cat-and-mouse game here is kind of the Wild West for warfare, and it is pushing drone warfare\ninto uncharted territory. And finally, these\ndrones on the front lines are being used to capture video, which is then edited together and usually set to some\nhardcore rock music and published to the Internet\nto boost morale in this war. (rock music) Morale is a key ingredient\nto winning a war. And war propaganda is\nas old as war itself. So when Ukrainians see this footage of a Ukrainian pilot cleverly\ntaking out a Russian target, it has a real effect. - [Off-Screen Voice] Yeah! Bombed them! - The rest of the world is\nwatching this as it unfolds. This is unprecedented territory, strapping explosives to\nsmall consumer drones and using them in a real\nworld warfare experience. So this is going to change war forever. And in fact, we're already seeing this. The Pentagon recently\nreleased this proposal for small businesses in\nAmerica to pitch them on how to build a small\nexplosive or munition that they can put on a small drone. This is a part of their\ninnovation and research effort. They say here in this\ndocument that the ability to put explosives on small drones is vital for the future of army combat operations. And that their ability\nto do this would advance the US Army's modernization priorities. They're basically saying that drones are a big part of the future of war, and they emphasize that\nwhatever this product is, it needs to be attachable\nby a soldier in the field, meaning someone's out\nthere on the front lines and they can take this explosive, they can put it on a drone\nand they can send it away. Exactly what they're doing in Ukraine. The Pentagon is watching what is happening and they're responding. But for those caught in the\nmiddle of this deadly war, drones are about one thing\nright now, and that's survival. Survival of their country. As this conflict grinds on, Ukrainians continue to show us just how serious they are\nabout enduring this long fight by coming together, by\nsupporting their troops, and endlessly innovating. And in the process, ensuring that their country\ndoesn't get swallowed by their much larger enemy. (speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (drone whirring) (drone whirring continues) (ambient music) Hey folks, thanks for watching. I loved working on this story because I got to talk\nto people on the ground. I got to interface with the\nexperience of Ukrainians and tinkerers and\ndefenders of their country. I mean, it was really compelling. I'm really grateful for all\nof those who who spoke to us. I wanna tell you about a couple things. Number one, I don't know\nif you all know this, but we have a second channel now. It's called \"Search Party.\" It is a geopolitical and global\nsports explainer channel. Turns out geopolitics and sports are becoming more and more intertwined. And this channel really breaks it down. It is run by my old Vox\ncolleague, Sam Ellis, who is the creator of \"Vox Atlas,\" and now he runs \"Search Party.\" So go over and subscribe. We have a lot of amazing videos coming out and you won't wanna miss them. If you like this stuff here, you'll like this stuff over there. I wanna say thanks to all\nthe members of The Newsroom, which is our Patreon. The Newsroom members\ncontribute to our journalism, and in return, they get a behind-the-scenes\nvlog every month. They get access to my scripts,\nthey get royalty-free music, and they get the warm, fuzzy feeling, that they're supporting our journalism. We want to do deeper and deeper\nvideos over on The Newsroom. They allow us to do that, to\nlevel up, to be more ambitious. Other ways to support\ninclude LUTs and Presets, which we use to color\nour photos and videos. All the links are in the\ndescription, as per usual. And the best support is just being here, watching the videos,\ncommenting, sharing, whatever. I really love the feedback\nthat I get from everybody. I love the good discussions\nand the comments. And I'm just happy that we can\ncontinue to make good stuff. So thanks for being here and\nI'll see you in the next one. Hey, before you go, I need\nto tell you one last thing, which is that we made probably\nour last batch of the poster that I designed last year. It's a poster called \"All Maps Are Wrong,\" and I'm very proud of it. It shows all the ways that\nyou can take our Earth and project it onto a 2D plane, which always comes with some distortion. Anyway, it's kind of a\nnerdy map lover thing, and if you're into that, you should go over and check\nit out before they're all gone. This is probably gonna be our last batch, so get 'em while they last, and the link's in the description."

A few decades ago, China gave a bunch of pandas to the U.S. National Zoo here in Washington, D.C., as a sign of friendship and diplomacy. But recently they took the pandas back because of the increasing tensions between these two countries. But after this meeting between these two presidents, Xi Jinping suggested that they should send the pandas back as a gesture of their friendship.

    "video_id": "2r5eKpptixo",
    "captions": "(dramatic music begins) - [Newsman] The president's\ncar is now turning on to Elm Street in open limousine parade. (gunshot fires) - [Johnny] There's a cover-up\nthat's about to happen here. - [Newsman] This is a\nsituation and I read, \"Kennedy is shot in head.\" - [Johnny] The\nassassination of a president and then a scramble by the U.S. government to hide information from its people. - So much information was\nhid from the American public. - [Lyndon] How many, how many,\nhow many shots were fired? - [J. Edgar] Three. - [Johnny] The question\nof who shot JFK and why has riveted America since that\nhorrifying day 60 years ago. But over time, it's become\nclear that the FBI and CIA kept information hidden, not just from the public,\nbut from the commission in charge of investigating\nthe assassination. This has fueled an understandable doubt in the official account, including, by the way, Lyndon B. Johnson, the president who took JFK's place. Congress even came out\nin the '80s saying that this was probably a conspiracy, and the public ran wild with this. They came up with hundreds of suspects of who could have been\ninvolved in the assassination. Theories like this thrive\nwhen government authorities aren't transparent with their people. So let me show you how this happened. Let me explain the official story and why that story has been\nhit with a wave of doubt over the decades and explain that unlike a\nlot of conspiracy theories, doubting the official story here isn't as crazy as you might think. (tense dramatic music) - [Journalist] This was a turning\npoint in American history. People all of a sudden decided, \"I'm not sure they're\ntelling us the truth.\" - JFK is this really\nsymbolic character who lived during a very, very important\ntime in American history, and the story really\ndives into the context of what it was like to be\nin America in the '60s. I'm really excited to dive in\nand show you all of the stuff. I need to thank the\nsponsor of today's video. Sponsors allow us to do\nthese super deep dives that take months to make with\nlots of different people, so thank you, BetterHelp,\nfor sponsoring the video. I'm a true believer in therapy.

Let's dive back in to\nthis fascinating story of what happened to JFK. (typewriter keyboard clacking)\n(tense suspenseful music) People loved John Kennedy. He was this good-looking guy who was always hanging out\nwith his beautiful family and he just seemed to\ninstill a sense of confidence in people. Kennedy rode this positive\nperception up the ranks of American politics to\nbecome the 35th president. This was in the early '60s when America was in a\ngiant time of transition. - Oh, this is a revolution, of course, that is sweeping our country now. - The U.S. was the global superpower and was locked in a Cold\nWar with another empire a world away. So JFK walks into the presidency to find his military\nand intelligence leaders causing a lot of trouble around the world. They had become very comfortable\nwith dangerous secrets. They were funding wars, they were overthrowing\ngovernments in faraway countries, they were assassinating leaders that threatened American interests, and they were doing most\nof this totally in secret. By the way, if you wanna know more\nabout those CIA shenanigans, go watch the video where\nwe map all the U.S. coups. Anyway, JFK walks in and\nsees this as \"too much.\" He wants to reign in these\nspy and military leaders from what he sees as an\nabuse of American power. He ended up firing and demoting\na bunch of these leaders, a lot of these intel and military guys who were plotting and\nexecuting covert operations around the world, and he continued to pursue\nlike his ideal of world peace. He chose diplomacy over violence. When nuclear-armed missiles\nwere found in Cuba, he slowed down the momentum towards a full-scale presence in Vietnam and he shut down several\nof these covert operations that were being planned\nby the leaders around him. This caused great tension between JFK and America's military and spy leadership. All of this context is important when we look back on that\nday in November 1963. - [Newsman] Friday morning, 11:37, the President's jet lands\nat the Dallas Airport. (typewriter keyboard clacking)\n(tense suspenseful music) - [Johnny] President Kennedy and the Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson arrived to Dallas for a speech that the President was to give. He got in this open-top\nlimousine with his wife, Jackie, and the Texas governor, John Connally, along with his wife, Nellie. They rode through these streets, downtown Dallas lined\nwith cheering spectators, and then gunshots rang out. (gunshot fires) - [Newsman] Kennedy\napparently shot in head. Blood was on his head. - [Johnny] The shots hit the\nPresident in the neck and head, also wounding Governor Connally. The President was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. - And very often, you'll find\na zipper hidden in the arm. - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. You'll excuse the fact\nthat I'm out of breath, but President Kennedy and\nGovernor John Connally have been cut down by assassins'\nbullets in downtown Dallas. The President has rushed\nto Parkland Hospital. (tense suspenseful music) (tense suspenseful music)\n(typewriter keyboard clacking) - [Johnny] Within hours\nof the assassination, the prime suspect became this\n24-year-old former Marine, a self-declared communist who had renounced his American citizenship and moved to the Soviet Union, where he then fell disenchanted\nwith life in Russia and move back to the U.S. Eventually, ending up on the sixth story of this building in Dallas where he worked and where he was on\nthat morning in November where he aimed a rifle\nand shot the President. His name was Lee Harvey Oswald. And after these shots rang out, he fled. While on the run, he shot and\nkilled a Dallas police officer before hiding in a movie theater and then eventually being arrested at around 2:15 PM that day. - I didn't shoot anybody, no, Sir. - There was to be a trial, and Oswald planned to plead not guilty, claiming the whole thing\nwas actually a setup. - I'm just a patsy. - Patsy, which is like an old-timey term for like the fall guy,\nthe one who was setup. That same day, the vice\npresident, Lyndon B. Johnson, was rushed back to the presidential plane and sworn in as the new\npresident of the United States before taking off and\nheading back to Washington. At the same time, the FBI, the top investigatory body in our country, descends onto Dallas. And very quickly, the director\nof the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, who's a big part of the story, he comes to a conclusion\nas to what happened. This is before any investigation\nhad really gone forth. And Hoover decides that Oswald absolutely was the one who did it. He was a communist sympathizer, he was a frustrated misfit, and crucially, he acted alone. There was no one else. Here's a phone call between Hoover and the new president, LBJ. - [J. Edgar] There's no question\nbut that he is the man now. The fingerprints and things we have. - I'd like some legal representation, but you, police officers, have\nnot allowed me to have any. - But luckily, we have a justice system and we would find what\nthe facts actually say. Oswald was going to stand trial where the evidence could\nbe thoroughly examined, where the country could see for themselves who actually shot their President and get closure on this horrifying event, where whoever did it could\nactually be brought to justice. But that never happened. Two days after the assassination, while Oswald was being transferred from police headquarters\nto the county jail, a nightclub owner named Jack Ruby jumped out in front of the\ncrowd of police officers and news reporters and shot Oswald. (gunshot fires) He was quickly rushed to the hospital where he died soon after, the same hospital where\nPresident Kennedy had died just 48 hours earlier. - Lee Oswald has been shot. - I think he got what he deserved, if he's the one that did it. - It is difficult to say\nhow long it will take for the full realization of\nwhat happened to really sink in. - With Oswald dead,\nthere could be no trial, no real sense of justice. This left the government\ninvestigators, the FBI mostly, with the opportunity to\nreally own the narrative of what happened. The very next day, the Deputy Attorney General\nsends a memo to the White House stressing that the\npublic must be satisfied with this explanation\nthat Oswald acted alone. He didn't have co-conspirators\nthat were still at large. This had to be the story, and\nI'll explain why in a sec. This memo also included some wisdom and kind of a foreshadow\nof what was gonna happen over the next several decades where the memo urges the\nWhite House to release as much information as\npossible to the public so as to avoid public speculation. Just remember that advice, \"Release the information to\navoid public speculation.\" It's kinda the most\nimportant part of the story. We have these recently\nreleased phone recordings between the FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover, and the new president, LBJ, and we see in this phone call that the FBI actually didn't\nwant a thorough investigation. - [Lyndon] I think it\nwould be very, very bad to have a rash of investigations. - [J. Edgar] It'd be a three-ring circus. - [Lyndon] Well, the only\nway to stop them is probably to appoint a high level one\nto evaluate your report. I can select out of the government, and I could tell the House and Senate not to go ahead with the investigation. - [J. Edgar] Yes. - LBJ creates this group\ncalled the Warren Commission, and you can see in these phone calls, he was asking the FBI director who should be on the Commission. - [Lyndon] What do you\nthink about Allen Dulles? - [J. Edgar] I think\nhe would be a good man. - [Johnny] Wait, did you catch that? Allen Dulles, he was the former director of the CIA. He's one of the guys that JFK fired after he tried to overthrow\nthe Cuban government. And now, he's about to be\nappointed to the committee investigating Kennedy's assassination. This did nothing to instill\ntrust in the Commission. - The new president appointed a Commission of seven prominent Americans to investigate the whole affair. - [Lyndon] The Special\nCommission will have before it all the evidence uncovered\nby the Federal Bureau of Investigation and all the information available to any agencies\nof the Federal Government. - The Warren Commission\nwas given just 10 months to investigate this\nsituation using the evidence that was mostly provided\nto them by the FBI. They produced this report, which essentially confirms the conclusion that J. Edgar Hoover, the\ndirector of the FBI, had come to in the hours and days\nfollowing the assassination, that on November 22nd, the shots fired that killed the President and wounded the Governor\nwere fired by one guy, Lee Harvey Oswald. The report stresses that he acted alone. They say it very definitively. He nor the person who killed\nhim two days later, Jack Ruby, were a part of any conspiracy,\ndomestic or foreign. All of the shots came solely from the sixth floor of this building, and crucially, there were\nonly three shots fired. Three bullets. - [Lyndon] How many, how many,\nhow many shots were fired? - [J. Edgar] Three. - [Lyndon] Any of them fired at me? - [J. Edgar] No. - [Lyndon] All three to the President? - [J. Edgar] All three to the President, and we have them. - [Johnny] The report\nsays that the first bullet likely missed the car completely, but that the second one did\nsomething very interesting. It first hit the president in the back and then exited his chest. It then entered through\nthe governor's back, went through his rib, and\nthen exited through his chest, but it wasn't done yet. It then entered his wrist,\nshattering the wrist bone, and then exited the wrist and went partially into\nthe governor's leg. Whoa, okay. It's quite the journey for one bullet. Oh, and the bullet in question, which just apparently made seven wounds, supposedly looked like this, which some ballistic experts have said looks a little too pristine for a bullet that allegedly just went\nthrough two human bodies. And then, of course, the third bullet, according to the Warren Commission, was the one that delivered the fatal headshot to the President. This was the explanation\nthat the Warren Commission came up with to explain all of the wounds that were found on the victims. All of this damage had to be\ndone with just three bullets, and why just three bullets? Again, ask J. Edgar Hoover\nright after the assassination. - [J. Edgar] On that floor, we found the three empty\nshells that had been fired. - They only found three\nshells up on that sixth floor. So if all of this damage was done with more than three bullets, that would mean that there had\nto be more than one shooter. A conspiracy. But there couldn't be a conspiracy. Hoover had adopted this line of thinking right after the assassination, this assumption that it was just one guy, and that line of thinking endured into the Warren Commission, a commission that Hoover himself helped the President assemble. In the end, the Commission used a lot of cherry-picked evidence\nprovided to them by the FBI that supported their\nalready-drawn conclusions. And in the process, they turned any focus away from exploring all\nof the possibilities, including the possibility of a conspiracy. The report focuses almost\nentirely on one guy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and his three bullets. - Who killed John F. Kennedy? The Commission answers\nunequivocally, \"Lee Harvey Oswald.\" Was Oswald a member of a conspiracy? The Commission answers, \"He acted alone.\" - They ignored witnesses that\ncontradicted their stories. They ignored or modified\nthe signed reports from surgeons and doctors who\nworked with President Kennedy immediately after he\narrived to the hospital that said that the wounds in\nthe President's neck-chest area looked like they came in from the front, meaning not from this building that was behind the President. In other words, the FBI\nand the Warren Commission ignored the advice from that memo that admonished the government\nto release all of the facts. In my mind, this was the biggest mistake and the root of all\nthe conspiracy theories that exists today. The question I had in all of this is, why? Why not do a proper investigation that explores the possibility\nthat this was done by a group of conspirators\ninstead of just one guy? For me, the answer to this question has a lot to do with the greatest fears that the American government\nand people were facing in the early 1960s. (tense suspenseful music)\n(typewriter keyboard clacking) First, we have to remember\nthat 1960s America was right in the heart of the Cold War, a time of constant vigilance\nof fear of nuclear apocalypse, of extreme tension between\nthese two superpowers. If this assassination was seen as an attempt to topple the government. Or even worse, if it had been\norganized by the Soviet Union or its fellow communist regime in Cuba, that would create a sense of panic among the American public. It would be a very different situation than a 24-year-old communist\nsympathizer acting alone. A believed conspiracy\nwould also create pressure from the American public to strike back, which could lead to an escalation with another nuclear-armed nation. Oh, and the CIA also had an incentive to keep an investigation\nfrom being too widespread. At the time, they were secretly conducting\nall of these operations to assassinate Cuba's\nleader, Fidel Castro. This was a big deal and it\nwas a big secret at the time. Any deep investigation into\npossible conspiracy with Cuba might reveal that the CIA is trying to assassinate Fidel Castro, which would not be good for the CIA. So one way to read all of this, the memos, the rushed conclusion, the emphasis on Oswald acting alone, the need for there to\nonly be three bullets, you can see this as a bunch\nof government officials scrambling to keep the\nAmerican public calm to make sure that\npandemonium doesn't break out all while reducing the possibility of geopolitical escalation\nwith the Soviet Union. You can see this in some\nof these phone calls where the new president is deeply worried about keeping the American people united around a simplified\nnarrative of what happened. He's worried that if\nalternative theories get out, it could threaten our entire system. So their tactic for doing this\nwas to hijack the narrative to suppress and influence\nthe investigation and make it very simple, Oswald did it. That's it. Here's the problem though. Eventually, people will do the math and realize that the government has been keeping the\nfull picture from them, and that's exactly what happens next. (tense suspenseful music)\n(typewriter keyboard clacking) So the Warren Commission files its report with the official story of what happened, but soon after they do so, members of the Warren\nCommission themselves come out and say like they\ndon't actually believe the story that the Warren Commission just put out, especially when it comes\nto the key assertion that one bullet was responsible\nfor causing seven wounds. - I could not convince myself that the same bullet struck both of them. - [Interviewer] You\nmean that you, yourself, weren't convinced about\nthe single-bullet theory? - No, I wasn't convinced. - [Johnny] Governor Connally, the one who was sitting in front of JFK and the one who was supposedly shot by that one single bullet, he disagreed with the story. - I understand there's some question in the minds of the experts\nabout whether or not we could both have been\nhit by the same bullet. I just don't happen to believe that. - Even the new president,\nLBJ, wasn't totally convinced. I mean, he was kind of secretive about it, but he eventually did come out and tell a reporter from the Atlantic that he thought that\nthis was a conspiracy, that it was Cuba\nretaliating against the U.S. for all of these CIA attempts\nto assassinate their leader. This was not good for the Warren\nCommission and their story. Then, 12 years after the assassination, this full uncut version of a strip of film that shows the assassination of JFK, it finally airs on national TV. - It's the film shot by the\nDallas dress manufacturer, Abraham Zapruder, and it's the execution\nof President Kennedy. - This was the first time\nthat Americans could see solid visual evidence of this event, but why hadn't it been released earlier? To some, this film contradicted the official account from\nthe Warren Commission and it sparked this new\ndemand for real answers from a government that kept behaving like it was hiding something. All of this is coinciding with\na time in American history where Americans are losing\nfaith in the Federal Government. You just see this massive like nosedive. All of the CIA's covert operations are starting to come to light, the country is mired in\nthis endless war in Vietnam, the President's people were\njust found spying on their political opponents in a hotel in D.C. Like, the government has not\nearned our trust at this point, so people are like, \"It wouldn't be a far\nstretch that the government was also behind the assassination of JFK.\" This was furthered by the\nsuspicious assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. - Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence\nin the Civil Rights Movement has been shot to death\nin Memphis, Tennessee. - This was all too much and\nthe people wanted answers. So in a shining moment of\nredemption of our democracy, Congress responded by forming a committee that reopened the\ninvestigations into these two assassinations, JFK and MLK. This committee did a real investigation. They actually were earnest about this and they confirmed what a lot of Americans were already feeling, which is that the Warren\nCommission's investigation didn't sufficiently look into the possibilities of a conspiracy. They say it point blank. They were way too fixated\non their assumptions that it had to be this\nlone gunman that did it and that their conclusions\nwere way too definitive, and then they specifically\ncall out the FBI and the CIA for withholding information\nfrom the investigation. One FBI agent even testified\nthat he was ordered by his superiors to destroy evidence. In this case, a letter that\nOswald had written to the FBI. - And he handed it to me and\nhe said, \"Oswald's dead now. There can be no trial. Here, get rid of this.\" - Why was the FBI asking its\nagents to destroy evidence? The committee concluded that\nit was a \"high probability that it was two gunmen that fired at JFK and that it was probably a conspiracy.\" That's what it says. But they stopped short\nof trying to determine who that other gunman was or who had organized the conspiracy. And then they once again\nmake the recommendation that all of the information\non this topic be made public. - Isn't it time for the American people to, at least, know what\nhappened at 12:30 PM in Dallas, Texas on November 22nd, 1963? - Quick caveat, the committee's conclusion that the assassination\nwas probably a conspiracy relied heavily on one piece of evidence, which was the sound\nrecording from that day where you can hear gunshots\nand you hear more than three, and it kind of inferred that there were like multiple shooters. This evidence was later challenged and kind of debunked by the FBI, but also a different research\nfacility that basically said, \"This sound recording\nwasn't even gunshots. It wasn't even recorded during the time of the assassination.\" But to me, the whole conspiracy\nthing was not actually the most important part of\nthis committee's report. The most important part\nwas that they confirmed that the Warren Commission had\nbeen cherry-picking evidence and hiding stuff from the American people. After the Congressional Committee confirmed to the American\npeople that the FBI and the CIA had been hiding evidence, the conspiracy theories rose up once again culminating in this\nmovie in the early '90s that paints an alternative picture of what could have happened here, a shadowy government conspiracy\nto kill the President, or at least a conspiracy\nto cover up the real story. - Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the mafia, keeps them guessing like\nsome kind of parlor game, prevents them from asking the\nmost important question, why? Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited? Who has the power to cover it up? - The film was largely conjecture, kind of based on some elements of truth, and some might argue that it\nwas irresponsibly misleading to, like, show the American public like, \"Hey, the government\nkilled the President.\" But hey, in a world where the\ngovernment isn't being clear and forthright to the American people, this film felt like a response. Maybe the government was hiding the truth, maybe the government did do it, or maybe they're just\ncovering something up. We don't know because they\nhaven't released information. This was a popular movie and people latched onto the\ntheories presented in this film. - The notion that there were\nmore than one set of shooters the way that it's presented\nphysically in this movie is highly convincing. - Public pressure got so intense that Congress finally decided to do what they should have done in the '60s, which is force all of these agencies to release all of the information. So in 1992, Congress passes this law that would lay the\nfoundation for releasing all of the documents\nrelated to the assassination by October 2017. That was the deadline. They assembled a committee\nand gave them several years to go through all of the documents and reexamine the official account and prepare these documents\nfor release to the public. We actually talked to the\nchairman of that committee. - I was nominated by President Clinton to chair the Assassination\nRecords Review Board. - In the process of going over\nall of this documentation, this review board found\nsome more inconsistencies and discrepancies and instances\nof potential cover-up, like the autopsy. There's an entire video I could\nmake about just the autopsy and the missing brain and all of this, but the crux of it is that what\nthe doctors and surgeons saw moments after the President was shot. They recorded and they, like, wrote down, but then what the official autopsy record actually looked like when it was released was something very different. The way the wounds were described, where the wounds were, what the brain looked like, all of this stuff had\nbeen changed or modified. The photos themselves had\npotentially been changed, and then the brain itself\nlike literally went missing. It's like unaccounted for. So anyway, that's an entire rabbit hole that you can go down if you want to. Releasing all these records also revealed that the CIA and FBI had been keeping tabs on Oswald's whereabouts,\nwhich maybe makes sense because he was like a Soviet sympathizer, but like, why didn't we know that before? We learned that the Secret\nService had destroyed documents, the original motorcade\nroute sheets that they had, the surveillance tapes from that day. They had destroyed them. - Now, we found those documents in the hands of another agency, so ultimately there was no harm. - Judge Tunheim said that, yes,\nthey got a lot of documents, but a lot of stuff was still missing. Like, there was one guy at the CIA who took control of the investigation a couple weeks after the assassination, and all of his records\nare just unaccounted for. - Now, did he destroy them all? Maybe, I don't know. There's no real record of that, so you still have that\npreviously destroyed issue. - In total, they finally\nreleased 5 million documents by 2017, basically everything except\nfor a few thousand documents that the CIA still refuses to release. Why? Guys, come on. You can find this whole\ntrove of JFK documents on the National Archives' website. We'll put a link in the description. Okay, but here's the\ncraziest part of all of this. Even after 5 million\ndocuments were released to the American public, to a public that was like\nhungry for like conspiracy, still, there is no solid-smoking\ngun evidence in any of this that points to a conspiracy, that points to anyone other\nthan Lee Harvey Oswald as the person who\nassassinated the President by himself, acting on his own. Now, the evidence may exist somewhere, but it's been destroyed or whatever. The point is, the government\ncould have released these 5 million documents in the '60s. Like, they could have done this\nback when people wanted it, back when they should have, and it wouldn't have\nchanged their official story and it would've satiated\nan American public that was skeptical of their government. At this point though,\nI think it's too late. The feeling that the\ngovernment was hiding something has now sunk deep into\nthe American psyche. We all kind of are like, \"The JFK assassination, yes,\nsomething was up there.\" I'm not really sure they're ever gonna regain our trust on this one because of how much hiding\nof information there was throughout all of these decades. So on the internet, all around, from people who are\nactually pretty credible, you have alternative\nexplanations that abound. Maybe it was LBJ who planned it so that he could be president. Or what I believe is perhaps\nthe most feasible theory, which is that some\nrogue faction in the CIA wanted to take out JFK because JFK was against\nwhat the CIA was up to. He was shutting down\ntheir covert operations. And then there's, of course,\nthe idea that Cuba did it. I mean, that's what LBJ, the\npresident after JFK, thought. Like, he was like, \"It was probably Cuba because we've been trying to\nassassinate their leader.\" The point is that because\nof the information vacuum left by the CIA and the\nFBI holding back evidence from the American people, people started to look at\nthe evidence they did have and grasp at any evidence they\ncould find for conspiracy. They started connecting\nthe dots of the witnesses who met mysterious or suspicious deaths. Many theorists will fixate\non this mysterious man holding an umbrella in\nthis video on a sunny day, maybe giving the signal\nto a second shooter? It's all very tantalizing, and some of it is actually very valid as like leads for further investigation. But despite a lot of really fishy stuff, I have not seen any solid evidence that proves an alternative story to the one that was told\nto us back in the '60s that Lee Harvey Oswald\nwas the guy who did it and he acted alone. I think it's very plausible that there could be some conspiracy. I think we will never know because we simply don't have the evidence. One thing I do know for certain though is that the moment this investigation turned into an effort\nto stifle information and influence the facts\ntowards one conclusion, it laid the foundation for the public to turn this into a\ncesspool of speculation. Again, I keep going back to that feeling of being lied to by your government. It's very potent. It sticks with you. It creates fertile ground for conspiracy theories\nof all kinds to sprout. Because when you feel\nlike you're being lied to by your own democracy,\nby your own leaders, no matter the reason or justification, it makes you feel like you're on your own, like no one's got your back, and that you are the one who\nneeds to find the real truth. And to me, it's that space that the most enduring conspiracy theories find their footing.

It actually involves multiple\ncountries and groups, all with different\ninterests and capabilities and all with the power\nto influence this war. In this video I wanna show\nyou each of these groups. I wanna show you who\nthey are, what they want, what their calculations are. And to show you how this war between Israel and Hamas\nis threatening to spread. Spread to the rest of the region, but also to the rest of the world. - [Announcer] And U.S.\nofficials are worried that this could escalate\nbeyond just a conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and could in fact become a regional war. (men chanting) - The Gaza Strip is one of\ntwo Palestinian territories. It's home to over 2 million Palestinians and it's different than the West Bank. The West Bank is cut up and governed by a mix of Israeli occupation and a Palestinian national government. Gaza, on the other hand,\nis governed by Hamas. An Islamist organization\nwith a militia wing whose mission is to\nresist and oppose Israel to fight against Israeli\noccupation of Palestinians by whatever means necessary, including terrorism and violence. Hamas chose October 7th, 2023 to launch their most deadly attack. Breaking down the border wall\nsurrounding the Gaza Strip and massacring civilians in a ground and rocket assault on Israel. This terrorist attack killed\nan estimated 1,400 Israelis and Hamas ended up taking 229 hostages back to the Gaza Strip. - Hamas is expert at using\ntunnels and basements to hide people, including hostages. - It was a senseless\nslaughter of innocent lives and it was the most deadly\nattack in Israel's history. Immediately after the attack,\nIsrael declares war on Hamas. They call up a reservist\nforce of 360,000 soldiers and they immediately start\nbombing the Gaza Strip. - [Announcer] Thousands of airstrikes and Gaza is now cut off from\nelectricity, water, and food. - Their stated mission is not just to strike back against Hamas, but to end the group forever. - [Announcer] Israel's\nfurious strikes on Gaza are laying waste to entire neighborhoods. (people panicking) (electronic music) - Israel says that the\nnorth of the Gaza Strip is now an evacuation zone\nthat they're going to bomb. And they tell the 1 million\nPalestinians living there to leave, to evacuate towards the South. (person speaking foreign language) But Palestinians can't leave this area. Their southern border is with Egypt and Egypt has vowed that\nthey will not let anyone in. The Prime Minister made this\npoint very clearly by saying that Egypt is willing to sacrifice, quote millions of lives to avoid allowing Palestinians into Egypt. So the airstrikes continue and Israel says that they're preparing\nfor a ground invasion to send troops into the Gaza Strip, to target Hamas fighters and leaders. (ominous music) This is when Israel's most\nimportant ally swoops in. - [Announcer] Joe Biden,\nthe U.S. president has landed in Israel. - President Joe Biden travels to Israel and urges the Israeli Prime Minister to not make the same mistake\nthat the U.S. made after 9/11. Sending in troops to wage\na grueling and doomed war against highly motivated fighters and eventually ending up\nfighting in dense cities where militants and\ncivilians blend together. (electronic music) The U.S. learned that no matter how\npowerful your military is, this kind of warfare is brutal and very difficult to\nachieve any kind of victory. The U.S. is also worried\nthat if Israel invades Gaza, that it will trigger a broader\nconflict in the Middle East. And this is where we need to zoom out to get a bigger-picture look\nat the rest of this region. (electronic music) - [Announcer] War between Israel and Hamas threatens to explode\ninto the wider region. - If we wanna understand the\ngeopolitics of this region, you have to look at Iran. Iran is the country that\nwants to be the most powerful and influential country\nin the Middle East. This puts them in direct\nconflict with Israel, a powerful country that is nuclear-armed that is also a foothold\nfor the United States to project its power in the Middle East in Iran's neighborhood. (electronic music) So there's this deep enmity\nbetween Iran and Israel and by extension, the United States. (electronic music) Instead of attacking Israel directly, which would be a catastrophe, Iran opposes Israel by funding\na network of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish militia\ngroups and governments around the region. Giving them money and weapons as part of what they call\nthe axis of resistance against Israel and by\nextension, the United States. One of these groups in the\naxis of resistance is Hamas. Iran supports Hamas by\ngiving them training, money, and very importantly, weapons. Like the thousands of rockets that Hamas fired into\nIsrael on October 7th as a part of their attack. This axis of resistance exists to keep constant pressure on Israel, to make Israel think twice\nabout ever attacking Iran. Iran needs Israel to think that this network is a credible threat, that they will act if\nIsrael does something that they don't like. So as Israel bombards the Gaza Strip killing all of these civilians, Iran and their axis of resistance\nfeels pressure to respond. So you start to see all\nthese small-scale attacks all throughout the region targeting Israeli and American targets. - [Announcer] Increasing\nattacks by Iranian proxies on U.S. forces stationed in the region. - Most of this action breaks out in Israel's northern border with Lebanon, home to Iran's most powerful\nproxy group called Hezbollah. A political and military organization with tens of thousands\nof well-trained soldiers. They're armed to the teeth\nand they're funded by Iran. They have over 100,000\nmissiles of varying ranges capable of hitting almost all of Israel. Hezbollah is actually a much\ngreater threat to Israel than Hamas in Gaza. And in the weeks following the attack, Hezbollah shows that\nthey're ready to fight by shooting at Israeli\nmilitary installations along this border region, Israel strikes back at Hezbollah\nin these border skirmishes, threatening an escalation. They drop bombs on two airports in Syria. Airports where Iran sends weapons\nand supplies to Hezbollah. It looks like an escalation, especially as Israel moves most of its soldiers up here, not to Gaza. While tens of thousands of\nIsraeli citizens are evacuated. - Attacks by Hezbollah\nand Israel are continuing with its fighters destroying\nan Israeli attack. - [Johnny] The U.S.\ncontinues to urge Israel not to invade Gaza, fearing that a ground invasion would cross Hezbollah's red line and provoke them to invade from the north, turning this into a two-front war. Which could boil over\ninto a three-front war if Palestinians in the West Bank rise up and start fighting with Israeli settlers and soldiers who occupy the West Bank. - [Announcer] The key to\na spread of the conflict lies on the Israel-Lebanon border. If that becomes a second front, the entire region will then feel the heat. - One of the paradoxes of global conflict is that even when all of the sides don't actually want a full-scale war, they have nothing to gain from it. A full-scale war can break out anyway. And in this case, what\nmight not be obvious is that Hezbollah and Iran actually don't want a\nfull-scale war with Israel, which would bring a war to Lebanon, a country that has been\ncrumbling under economic turmoil in recent years, for which\nsome Lebanese blame Hezbollah. A war would deepen this crisis and deepen the resentment for Hezbollah and threaten their ability\nto operate in Lebanon. And yet, as Israeli jets continue\nto bombard the Gaza Strip, Hezbollah and their Iranian\nsponsors have to show that they are willing to act, that they are a credible threat, that they have red lines\nthat are being crossed. This is the deadly game of chicken that escalates conflicts like this. This is what turns them into a situation that no one can control. But another paradox of global conflict is that some threats of force can actually diffuse the tension, can stabilize an escalating conflict. At least that's the bet that the United States made here. - The Pentagon's deploying 300\nmore troops to the Mideast. - [Johnny] While Israel was still debating whether or not to send troops into Gaza, the U.S. deploys two naval strike groups. One off the coast of Israel and the other off the coast of Iran. These groups are made up\nof huge aircraft carriers accompanied by supply and warships. We're talking 15,000 sailors in total standing watch as this conflict escalates. The U.S. also readies its\nmissile defense systems and prepares soldiers for deployment. It's a huge show of force, and it's the U.S. trying to\nuse its superior military power to send a signal to Iran and its proxies that they're there and they're watching and that they will be dragged\nin to any escalating conflict. - To any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking\nadvantage of the situation, I have one word, don't, don't. - And then against the warning of the United States, Israel\nsends troops into Gaza. - [Announcer] Israeli troops and tanks advanced further into Gaza\nengaged in urban combat. - The ground invasion is\nmore limited than expected, but it's what the Israeli Prime Minister is calling the second stage in their plan to completely destroy\nHamas and its leadership. As Israeli troops flooded into\nGaza, the big question was, would Hezbollah act? Would they invade from the north? And surprisingly, they didn't. And this shows us three things\nthat weren't as clear before. Number one, it shows\nthat the price of a war for Lebanon is huge and that Hezbollah is taking that into account. They stand accountable\nto the Lebanese people and Lebanon does not want war. It also shows us that Iran is hesitant to use Hezbollah in this context. Hezbollah is their most\npowerful card to play in deterring Israel from\never attacking them. And in using it to protect Palestinians, they will weaken Hezbollah's\nrole as a deterrent. Or to say it bluntly, what this shows us is Iran cares much more about its own security than it does about the plight of the Palestinians. (electronic music) But the third thing that this shows is that Hezbollah believes that Israel will not be\nsuccessful in their mission to eradicate Hamas. According to a Lebanese diplomat who talked to the New York Times, Hezbollah has been quote\nquietly telling its partners that it believes that\nHamas is in a good position and does not yet need Hezbollah's help. And indeed, Hamas itself\nhas come out and said that they're ready, that they've been preparing\nfor a ground invasion because they have an advantage. Inevitably, this ground invasion will mean luring Israeli soldiers into a labyrinth of\ndensely populated cities where fighters can easily hide\nand blend in with civilians. Not to mention Hamas' huge\nnetwork of hundreds of kilometers of underground tunnels where\nthey can hide, store supplies, and store their hostages. - [Announcer] The tunnels\nalso have a psychological use, an unseen, unpredictable\nangle designed to keep enemies wondering when and where\nthey'll be ambushed. - [Announcer] For any\nIsraeli ground offensive, this may prove the biggest challenge. - It's a truly excruciating\nkind of warfare in every conceivable sense. - This is a quickly changing situation and I don't know what\nthe conflict looks like when you are watching this, but right now the bombardment\nof Gaza continues. The death toll of\nPalestinians is skyrocketing. The people are running\nout of food and water and medical supplies. The UN is condemning\nIsrael's response saying that there's no justification\nfor what Hamas did, but Israel's response is too much. Too many civilians are being killed. Some at the UN are even\ncalling Israel's actions potential war crimes. And the world is calling\nfor a pause in the fighting, a ceasefire that would\nallow humanitarian aid to get into the strip. But a ceasefire is something\nthat Israel's Prime Minister says is not on the table. - After the horrific\nattacks of October 7th, calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel\nto surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism,\nto surrender to barbarism. That will not happen. - Egypt has just started\nletting foreign nationals and severely wounded people\nin the Gaza Strip leave and cross into their country, but they continue to deny\nentry to the vast majority of Palestinians who remain trapped inside of this small rectangle. But they are together\nwith Qatar helping mediate between the sides. Already facilitating a deal\nthat released four hostages that Hamas had captured on October 7th. For now, Iran's axis of\nresistance stands deterred from escalating this any further. Continuing small attacks, but calculating that a wider\nspread conflict isn't worth it, especially as the U.S. moves\nits troops into position. It is a delicate balance. One that could easily break or spiral. All it takes is one miscalculation, one attack that was meant to be a message, but actually kills dozens of people and elicits a stronger response, which in turn elicits\na stronger retaliation, which could lead to an escalation, a spiral into a catastrophic\nwar in the Middle East. (electronic music) And in the middle of this all, people and families who\nwanted nothing to do with any of this, who don't care about the\ngeopolitical calculations and the balance of power\nin the Middle East, millions of people confined to a war zone. Not sure if the last\nthing they'll ever see is the next airstrike from Israeli jets. Innocent civilian hostages\nkept in underground tunnels, not sure if they'll ever\nsee their families again. And the families who are mourning the loss of their loved ones who were taken by this senseless conflict. And at the root of it all, the leaders in charge of\nprotecting their people, but who have instead chosen to\npursue policies of division, occupation, violence, and hatred. The ingredients that produced\nthis current situation. (person speaking foreign language) So for now, we will watch\nas the Middle East sinks towards deeper and deeper conflict. And we will hope that\nlevel heads will prevail in the decision-making and\nthat somehow we can prevent more suffering and more loss of life. This is gearing up to be months, if not years of conflict in this region and I'll be following it and trying to make sense\nof it for everyone.

    "captions": "I'm sorry to report that the new Cold War between China and the United States has reached the pandas. These very cute, lovely giant pandas are famous and they are down the street at the zoo in Washington, D.C. and they have been since the \u201870s when Richard Nixon went to China, and as a gesture of friendship, China gave us two pandas. [Pat Nixon] I am pleased to accept the precious gift of the panda from the government of the People's Republic of China. We've had these two pandas at our zoo for the last 50 years, and now they're going home forever. China practices panda diplomacy, giving pandas to countries around the world that they're friends with. If you make China mad, they might take away your pandas. And that's potentially what's going on here. No one knows exactly why they didn't renew the lease for the pandas to stay at our zoo. but many experts think that it's because of the rising tensions between the United States and China. So, if you're here in D.C. and you love pandas, you've got a few more months to say goodbye."

    "captions": "- [Johnny] On August 28th, 2023, the Chinese government released a map. The map did a surprisingly good job at making a lot of other countries angry. - [Reporter 1] Several\ncountries have rejected China's new standard map. - It's a violation of the law. That's where I put that map. - [Johnny] The release\nof this map also was met with a huge event and\nannouncement within China. This featured the state media\nlaunching into a commentary on the importance of maps. (reporter speaks in Chinese) - [Johnny] Followed by\na warning to the people that maps that have errors can cause, quote, great harm to society. (speaks in Chinese) - [Johnny] So let's look at\nwhat's going on with this map. Why countries around the\nregion are condemning it and why China had to go\nto such great lengths to tell people that there's\nnothing wrong with these maps, and that in fact a map like\nthis is key to national unity. To do this, I'm gonna need a\nhigh res version of this map. Luckily, the Chinese\ngovernment has me covered. (reporter speaks in Chinese) (bright music) - I wanna show you what this map says and show you how China uses cartography to assert and project power in its region. Because as clean as this map looks, within it, there's\nactually a lot going on. Border tug of wars, fake islands, a 10th-dash on a line in the ocean, barbed wire wrapped clubs and proxy wars. It's the perfect example of\nhow maps aren't just maps, they're tools of national power. (bright music) I don't like the feeling\nof being spied on. And like all of us, I am spied on all of the time, not just by governments, but by corporations, by people who wanna make\nmoney off of my information. That brings me to this\nquick pause in our video to talk about our sponsor Incogni. Incogni is a personal\ninformation removal service. I don't like the feeling\nof being spied on. I don't think any of us do. But we all are kind of spied on, some of us by governments, but almost all of us are spied on by corporations who\ncollect our information, put it on these data broker lists, and sell it on an open market, to people who wanna make money off of us. Luckily, in many countries\nincluding the United States, we have laws and rights to remove ourselves from these lists, but most of us don't know how to do it. It's a cumbersome, bureaucratic process. And that brings me to the\nsponsor of today's video Incogni, which is a personal\ninformation removal service. I've been using Incogni\nnow for a few months, and it has changed my world. What you do is you sign up for Incogni and you give them permission, and then they go through the process of requesting that you\nbe taken off that list. And if anyone pushes back, like one of the corporations\nlike makes it harder, Incogni follows through with the process to make sure that you get\noff of all of these lists. And then they update you month after month so that you can see the progress, you can see your privacy being reclaimed. The people who want this\ninformation aren't just marketers who wanna sell you like new tennis shoes. But it's like people search sites, which are becoming a\nthing that use this data to like put you on these\npeople search sites so people can find your information. Health insurance companies will sometimes buy some of this data so that they can use like\nyour web browsing history to like jack up your\nhealth insurance bill. And perhaps, most annoyingly, it's spam. I mean, my phone was constantly exploding with like random robocalls. I got all these phishing\nscams all of the time, like my information was everywhere and it was blowing up\nmy phone in my inbox. I mean, there's no end to the shenanigans that corporations will do to make money off of you\nand your information. No longer, luckily, Incogni exists, and I am genuinely grateful for that. Unrelated to the fact that\nthey're sponsoring today's video, which like I'm very grateful for that too, I'm just grateful that they exist because I don't like my\ninformation just being everywhere. So if you want to get in\non Incogni at a discount, there's a link in my description. It's incogni.com/johnnyharris. When you click the link, it helps support the channel and it gets you 60% off their annual plan. The reason I have the annual plan is because even if you\nget taken off these lists, you'll eventually make it back on. And having Incogni there to\nconstantly monitor these lists and keep getting me off of them is of value to me. So the link's in the description. Use the code johnnyharris. Thank you Incogni for\nsponsoring our journalism. And now, it's time to dive into this mapping story about China and its very, very interesting new map. The government of China\nwants their country to look like this. But in reality, it looks\na lot more like this. We're gonna move left to right from India to Taiwan\nand the South China Sea. Oh, by the way, the Chinese government\nrequires its mapmakers to use this algorithm that\nintentionally scrambles the latitude and longitude\ncoordinates of their maps all in the name of national security. This makes it hard for people like me to work with Chinese maps, but we were able to\nhack through these maps and line them up with\nour own mapping systems, which is how we're able\nto make this video. Okay, with that, let's get started. First, we have Kashmir, a region that is already heavily disputed between India and Pakistan. The map shows that all of this\nsection is a part of China, and indeed, China controls it. But India claims that this\nactually belongs to them. It's the source of tense conflict. Both countries are building\nstuff in this region. Roads, communication towers, airfields, everything to be ready in case a full blown conflict breaks out. Troops from both sides face each other in a standoff at this line, the line of actual control, that's really what it's called. It loosely marks the border between these two massive countries, a border that was never\nreally agreed upon. Because remember where we are here. We're in the Himalayas, the tallest mountains on earth. Drawing lines and\ncontrolling territory here just doesn't work super well. But both sides want to exert control even here in the high mountains, especially in these\nimportant trade regions. These are two nuclear countries. And so they've agreed to not\nuse firearms up here, no guns. So instead, when conflict breaks out, it looks more like a medieval battle with barbed wire wrapped\nclubs and fence posts. The most recent clash was just in 2020 right here near Ladakh. 20 Indian soldiers and four\nChinese soldiers were killed. - [Reporter 2] Indian and Chinese soldiers fought on disputed land using\nstones and bamboo poles, and around two dozen people die. - As you go down the border\nbetween India and China, there are several more of\nthese pockets of disputed land in the Himalayas. As we head east, we'll hit Nepal, and I have to mention\nthat there was recently a leaked government report out of Nepal that asserts that China is encroaching into Nepal's sovereign territory, building stuff with no permission on Nepal's side of the border here in the Humla District. Nepal actually didn't want\nthis report to come out. They have to walk a fine line being sandwiched between\nthese two behemoth countries. And a big part of that means\nstaying on China's good side. A few years ago, I was up here shooting\nan episode of Vox Borders and the locals told me\nthat the Chinese military didn't respect the border. They kind of did whatever they wanted, which is why I wasn't even allowed to get up to the border fence\nbetween these two countries. It's an eerie feeling\nbeing so close to a country that is so serious about projecting its\npower to its neighbors. Anyway, let's keep going east where we'll hit another landlocked country in the Himalayas, Bhutan. The border here continues\nto make an effort to divide these countries in a rugged glacier filled expanse. Back in 2006, China quietly pressured Bhutan to give them this big chunk\nof mountain territory, and Bhutan conceded. They didn't really have a choice. And so while they kind\nof keep it hush hush, China is reminding the world that they actually control\nthis part of Bhutan. It's theirs now. China's using the same playbook\nin different parts of Bhutan blurring this northern border\nas they encroach south. In 2020, China claimed\nthat they actually own this part of Bhutan, a forested nature sanctuary. But strangely, this\nofficial map doesn't show that this area is inside\nof China's borders. Maybe it will next year. The most strategically important part of China's claim on Bhutan is here. This little strip of land\ngives us a better idea of why China is squeezing the\nborder of this tiny country. If you zoom out, you'll see where we are. Right here at this vital choke point between these two rivals, India and China, this thin corridor where India connects to its eastern states. Some call this the chicken neck. The map asserts that China\nowns this part of Bhutan, the Doklam Plateau, which provides them a perfect\nmilitary vantage point over the chicken neck,\nIndia's critical corridor. This would make India vulnerable in the case of an act of conflict. Oh, and their claim is\nnot just on the map. Satellite imagery analyzed by Reuters shows that China is building roads and settlements and structures on this sovereign territory of Bhutan, enhancing their strategic\nmilitary position and fortifying their claim on the map. These border shenanigans in Bhutan are considered a proxy for\ntension between China and India. Bhutan, like Nepal, is just\nsandwiched in the middle. - These satellite images of the Chinese incursions in Bhutan, where China has built roads and barracks on the undisputed\nterritory of Bhutan. - [Johnny] Okay, let's keep moving on. Next to Bhutan, China's map shows that all of this land are within its borders. They now call it South Tibet, but all of this territory\nbelongs to India. It's full of Indian citizens. India's claim to this land relies on this 890 kilometer borderline that a British representative drew in 1913 in partnership with a\nrepresentative from Tibet who agreed to the line. But China says this isn't legitimate. They own Tibet now, and they never authorized this line dividing Tibet from India. So on their map, they assert that all of\nthis belongs to China. And to take it a step further, they're actually renaming stuff\non their maps in this region from mountain peaks to rivers and cities, showing us how China wants to claim and standardize every\ncorner of its country, exerting control and influence\neven in these remote places. Now, India's not standing\nby and letting this happen. To counter this, the Indian government is\nspending a half a billion dollars to build roads and develop hundreds of villages with the goal of solidifying\ntheir claim to this land. As we head east, let me mention\nthat during the pandemic, China has been building a fence along this border with Myanmar mostly to keep people and\nelicit goods out of China. This border has always been porous. People who share culture and language would cross back and\nforth in formally trading, but this fence has totally changed that, and people are angry. I've considered doing an entire\nvideo on this border fence and how it's disturbing\nand affecting life here. If that's interesting to you, please let me know in the comments. So while this isn't a disputed territory, it is another example of\nChina's increased effort to tighten its control on\nevery corner of its land. Okay, now we've arrived to the ocean. The part of the map\nthat gets a little wild. The government map actually\nmakes it look simple. All of the water inside of\nthis dashed line is China's, but the reality actually looks like this. This is what's known\nas the nine-dash line, and it was effectively\na hand-drawn boundary by the Chinese government in the 1940s. It's not a precise border. It wasn't agreed upon\nby the countries here and nor is it legal, at least according to the\nPermanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague who calls the nine-dash line lawless because it clearly cuts through the waters that international law says belong to these neighboring countries. And that's how you get this\njumble of all these lines. But as superpowers do, China ignores all of\nthis because they can. And they continue to operate\nas if this entire ocean, which, by the way, is replete\nwith fish and fossil fuels, as well as militarily strategic islands and important trade routes, all of it is theirs. This has created active conflicts\nwith neighboring countries because for China, these aren't just lines on a map. China has been pumping\nsand onto tiny reefs to create islands where there were none. Then they build a military outpost on these newly created islands. In the last decade, they've built dozens of these outposts throughout the South China Sea, and you can see that\nthese militarized islands are right inside the waters that the world has agreed\nbelong to these other countries. The Chinese Navy also steps in, patrolling these waters and routinely harassing\nfishermen from other countries reminding them that China\nisn't subject to the rules. This is their water, just like their official map says. - [Reporter 3]] United States is accusing China of harassment. - [Reporter 4] A Filipino\nfisherman was chased by Chinese Coast Guard speedboats as he made a dash for the shallow waters of Scarborough Shoal last Friday. - [Johnny] A similar dispute is happening on a group of islands\na little north of here where Japan, China, and\nTaiwan all claim these islands that are surrounded by oil and gas fields. China will often flex on Japan by sending Coast Guard ships into the water and airspace\naround these islands. This is their neighborhood. They think these islands are theirs, and they're going to assert\nthat claim on the map, as well as in real life. On China's map, Taiwan is\nincluded as a part of China. Even though Taiwan has been\nindependent for decades, China insists that this is theirs. And if push comes to shove, they've made it very clear that they're willing to\nclaim it back by force. And to that end, this new map includes an\naddition to the nine-dash line, a 10th-dash, a line that drifts dangerously north to encircle the water east of Taiwan. This isn't the first time\nthat a 10th-dash has appeared on a Chinese government map, but it is a meaningful\nmoment for the government to just slip in another dash and it's created a big debate about what this actually means. But one thing that almost\nall experts agree on is that China's ability to just\nswitch up their ocean claim by adding another dash communicates the original message\nof using a hand-drawn line as your maritime claim, which is that China feels\nhistorically entitled to this region, to this ocean, and they will behave how they choose in their own neighborhood, especially at a time when\nits neighbors are partnering with its geopolitical\nrival, the United States, to surround and encircle China with a large military\nbuildup in the region. The last one I'll mention is a tiny one that's kind of surprising. It's up here where the map\nclaims this river island that should belong to Russia. There was a dispute about this, but 20 years ago, Russia and China agreed to\nredraw the border like this, giving half of this island back to Russia. But in this map, they claim it once again and\nno one is totally sure why. So this new map out of China is a series of political statements, which arguably every map is. Some of these are worthy of debate, some are wishful thinking, and some are downright aggressive. But one thing is clear, China is now rich and powerful and motivated to exert its\ngeopolitical vision in the world. It's a reminder that maps\nhave always been a tool for great powers to\nexpress their aspirations. And this map in this\nmodern day is no different. (bright music)"

    "captions": "Joe Biden just warned Israel to be careful as they consider invading Gaza in response to these Hamas attacks. You would think that Hamas would be no match for the much stronger Israeli military. But what Biden is referring to is the lessons the U.S. learned after 9/11, when our very powerful military went to Afghanistan and Iraq and spent decades mired in warfare with much less powerful fighters, but crucially, fighting in cities. This thing that is much more difficult than any other kind of warfare. Military analysts told the Financial Times that if Israeli soldiers invade Gaza they\u2019re likely to find that fighters are actually dressed as civilians, that weapons might be stored in mosques, that houses will be rigged with explosives. And that there will be military facilities under schools. This will make it very difficult to fight with militants without inflicting major harm on civilians. The U.S. got sucked into decades of endless, unproductive urban warfare, and they're warning Israel to be careful as they consider their invasion strategy. I\u2019m going to be following this war to try to understand it, if you want to follow along for more."

Since Hamas's attacks, Israel has closed this northern border, leaving the crossing with Egypt as the only way out. But Egypt doesn't want to let Palestinians in. The country is not interested in housing a bunch of refugees from Gaza. And they're worried that because Israel is planning to invade the Gaza Strip, if these Palestinians come in, they may never go home. So, Palestinians are effectively trapped in this small rectangle that is turning more and more into a war zone. Joe Biden swooped in and made a deal with Egypt to let humanitarian aid come in through the southern border. But there's still no news on whether or not the Palestinians will be able to leave. And that is a big question for these 2 million people living in Gaza. If you want to better understand global politics, follow along for more."

    "captions": "- [Johnny] This is Kutupalong, the largest refugee camp in the world. There's nearly a million people here. It's located here at the\nsouthern tip of Bangladesh near a place called Cox's Bazaar. The people here are\nmostly Rohingya Muslims a people who now have no country. That's because in 2017, the military and citizens in their homeland, Myanmar forced them out in a\nbrutal ethnic cleansing that left thousands dead, their homes and villages\nburned to the ground. So let me tell you their\nstory, how they ended up here and hopefully you'll\nunderstand why this video is a fundraiser for these people to try to lighten their burden. Myanmar is no stranger to conflict between its many ethnic groups. But the violence that caused the Rohingya to flee their homes, that\nforced a million people into this refugee camp was different. It was violence that was\nfueled by hateful messages and disinformation,\ninflammatory fake stories spread by Buddhist\nnationalists and extremists, and even the military of Myanmar. (foreign language) - These messages were spread and amplified by one social media platform\nthat swept the country. A western tech company that\nhoped to corner the market in Myanmar and profit\nimmensely in this country, a country that was just\nstarting to use the internet. Let me show you how this happened. (suspenseful music) Ultimately, this is a\nstory about misinformation and radicalization on the internet. There are other bad things\nthat can happen on the internet and I'm gonna pause the story right now to tell you about the\nsponsor of today's video, who is in the business\nof protecting you online.

Sometimes I connect to\nthe internet via Britain so that I can get access\nto British Netflix content that isn't available here. But most people use North VPN to simply protect their online activity. It's not just a VPN anymore. It is now a threat protection\ntool that allows you to block malware, to block intrusive ads, and to generally give\nyou safety with your data as you surf the internet.

Thank you Nord VPN for\nsponsoring today's video and supporting our journalism. Now, let's get back to\nthis very important story about the internet and\nFacebook in Myanmar. Myanmar used to be called Burma, and it used to be closed off to the world. For decades, it was ruled\nby military dictators who kept the country closed,\nand poor, and oppressed. The military dictators\nbelonged to the Burmese Buddhist majority, and\nhad a particular fixation on marginalizing the Muslim\nminority called the Rohingya. Over the years, they stripped\nthe Rohingya of their rights not letting them move around the country. And in the '80s, they passed a law that said that these Rohingya people were not actually Burmese citizens. But then in 2010, in a surprise move, things in Myanmar started changing - [Reporter] Myanmar's new dawn\nhas been a long time coming. - The Burmese president\nhas hailed a new chapter in relations with the United States. - [Johnny] After decades of isolation, new leadership came to power and began opening up the\ncountry to the outside world. Soon, cell phones were\nflooding into the country at an astounding rate, jumping\nfrom nearly no cell phones in 2006 to 90% penetration by 2016. Cell phone towers started\npopping up all over the place, connecting the country to the\ninternet at a breakneck speed. - That internet adoption rate explodes from one half of 1% to 40%. And I know that might not sound like a lot if you're in the United States and everybody is on the internet. But when you were in a\nsociety where no one is online and suddenly half of the\ncountry is online, that is huge. - [Johnny] That's my old\nVox colleague, Max Fisher a journalist who recently wrote a book about social media algorithms and their role in stoking extremism in Myanmar and elsewhere. - Like, you go to a village and there might only be a few\npeople who have cell phones that have internet access, but those people are relaying\nwhat they're seeing there to everyone that they're meeting - [Johnny] For venture\nbacked US tech companies like Facebook looking for new users, this overnight internet\nadoption in Myanmar looked like an opportunity. 50 million potential users who are just coming\nonline for the first time. So Facebook made deals\nwith local phone providers making it so that smartphones came preloaded with the Facebook app, and that these new internet users could browse Facebook for free without using any of their\nexpensive mobile data. More and more people spread\nonline and alongside that, Facebook rapidly spread\nthroughout the country. - I remember that number 40%\ninternet adoption rate well almost the exact same\nproportion of the country, 38% in 2016, says that they\nprimarily get their news from Facebook, that's huge. 38% is way bigger than any media source that I can think of in the United States by this huge proportion... - [Johnny] For most people in Myanmar Facebook was the internet,\nFacebook was the news, and almost immediately videos\nlike this start showing up. (foreign language) - [Johnny] This is Ashin\nWirathu a Buddhist monk who is the leader of the 969 movement. It's an extremist movement\nthat focuses on the Rohingya, spreading conspiracy theories about them how they're invading the country, how they're planning to\ndestroy the Burmese people. Wirathu called himself\nthe Burmese Bin Laden, and he made a career out of becoming an anti Rohingya preacher. One of his main methods\nwas always paper pamphlets and leaflets. He would distribute these throughout the country to spread his lies and his conspiracies about the Rohingya. But in 2003, he was sentenced\nto 25 years in prison for all of this hate speech. But he was released early in 2012, right as Myanmar was changing, opening up, becoming connected to the internet. As Wirathu entered Burmese society he found a new tool to spread\nhis anti Rohingya messages. An algorithm designed\nto serve users content that will engage them,\nthat will outrage them, that will keep them on the\nplatform for as long as possible so that a tech company in California can sell ads and make money. - So the thing that the Facebook\nalgorithm learns to promote in Myanmar very quickly is\nhatred of the Muslim minority. - [Johnny] Over the next few years, Wirathu found a home for his hate speech on Facebook and YouTube,\nbut mostly Facebook which had quickly become the country's favorite\nsocial media platform. This significantly amplified his reach to hundreds of thousands of\nFacebook users in the country. (foreign language) - [Johnny] And he was just\none of many spreading lies and conspiracies about the Rohingya. - Hate speech, conspiracies,\nand incitements to violence, all directed at the\ncountry's Muslim minority are just overrunning the platform. - [Johnny] Over the next five years, tension between the\nBurmese Buddhist majority and the Rohingya Muslim minority\nturn more and more violent as the country grapples\nwith the rapid change in economic growth associated\nwith opening up to the world. This tension and racism in no\nway was caused by Facebook. But it was on Facebook\nthat a troubling pattern started to emerge. Somewhere in the country,\nthere's a a crime, it's allegedly committed\nby some Rohingya person like the alleged assault and\nmurder of a Burmese woman by a group of Rohingya men. News of the crime spreads like wildfire, some of it making it onto social media. Remember, Facebook was\nthe news for many people. And of course, we all know\nwhat happens on the internet as it spreads, the story\nchanges, conspiracies emerge that the Rohingya are stockpiling weapons or that they are actually\nforeign invaders, and that they're planning to take over. Anti-Rohingya voices with\nbig followings chime in, saying that this is proof of what they've been saying all along. The Rohingya are planning\nto take over the country and they must be expelled. And soon the fight goes from social media to the doorsteps of the\nRohingya people themselves. - The state of emergency has\nbeen declared in Western Burma where deadly clashes between\nBuddhists and Muslims have killed at least 17 people. Hundreds of homes were set a light and... - [Johnny] The first massive outbreak of violence in this era happened in 2012. - [Narrator] We're\nburning Rohingyas' houses because they live near our village, and they gather at night\nand try to attack us. - [Johnny] Ordinary Burmese\ncitizens headed the call, raiding Rohingya villages and\nburning them to the ground. The security forces had to step in but not to stop the violence. Instead, to help the destruction. Witnesses report that the security forces wouldn't let the Rohingya\nextinguish the fire that was burning down their\nhouses even when they tried. They just stood by and let it happen. From this 2012 incident, which is kind of the\nbeginning of our story, the government officially reported that 192 people were killed,\n8,600 homes destroyed. But experts say that the numbers are almost certainly much higher. 140,000 Rohingya were\nforced to leave their home. Many fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh. Facebook didn't play a huge role in this first major outbreak\nof violence back in 2012. The platform was new and\njust getting started, but this pattern of conspiracies and rumors spreading on the platform, and then leading to real world violence, that pattern continued to grow as more and more people got on Facebook. And soon it would play a role\nin helping Buddhist extremists commit what many call genocide. So where's Facebook, the\ncompany in all of this? There was this journalist\nand digital researcher, Aela Callan was in Myanmar\nconducting research on a Stanford fellowship\nlooking into hate speech online. And she's seen this pattern emerge. - [Max] She's so alarmed,\nshe flies all the way back to Silicon Valley to meet with\npeople at Facebook to say, \"Hey, this is really\ndangerous, it's really bad.\" It turns out she learns in that meeting that Facebook has exactly one\nmoderator who speaks Burmese, which is one of the many\nlanguages spoken in Myanmar, which basically means\nit's entirely ungoverned. - [Johnny] Callan attempts\nto sound the alarm. - [Max] She's warning them in this meeting with Facebook executives,\n\"This is really dangerous. What you are doing is really destabilizing for this country at a really fragile and really tenuous moment,\"\nand they basically do nothing. And this happens over and over again in the four years between when\nFacebook arrives in Myanmar and when the genocide starts. - [Johnny] This was a\npart of a larger trend, not just from Facebook but the whole international community. They didn't wanna focus on the dark side of what was going on in Myanmar. They wanted to focus on\nthe positive aspects. Myanmar's miraculous and\nsudden opening up to the world. - The world's attitude is, \"Hey, this was a extreme\nauthoritarian military dictatorship closed off from the outside\nworld, that it's opening up, they're having elections,\nthey're having democracy, they're turning away from\nChina towards the West. Isn't this great?\" - [Johnny] Just a month after\nthis first spat of violence president Obama visits Myanmar and meets with the government. Foreign companies continue\nto invest in the economy of Myanmar, and Facebook's presence as a key source of information\ncontinues to spread. But under the surface,\nin the algorithmic feeds of millions of users, hate and conspiracy was being rewarded with attention. The algorithm feeding it\nto more and more users enraging them, inflaming them confirming their beliefs and their biases. - [Reporter] According to\nhuman rights campaigners 20 Muslim students were\nmurdered here in March, when religious violence\nswept through this city in central Myanmar. - [Johnny] Wirathu audience kept growing into the hundreds of thousands. His speeches reaching a\nlarger and larger audience, and the pattern continued. In the town of Meiktila, an argument in a Muslim owned\ngold shop turned into a brawl leaving a Buddhist man injured. Buddhist extremists post\ninciting messages on Facebook saying that more attacks are coming, that the Rohingya are dangerous. And once again, what\nstarted in the newsfeed turns into a violent Buddhist mob. Roaming the streets, forcing\npeople out of their homes, burning mosques to the\nground, killing dozens. And once again, the security\nforces largely stand by allowing another massacre. In fact, the military starts\nto participate in a new way. Restricting the movement of the Rohingya, forcing them into camps\nand not letting them leave. In response to these conditions, some Rohingya form an insurgency group and start fighting back, but\nthey're totally outmatched. Extremism on Facebook continues to grow. And in March of 2014 Aela\nCallan once again makes the trip to Silicon Valley to deliver a warning. \"Hate speech and disinformation are spreading on the platform\nand it will lead to violence.\" But once again, Facebook did nothing. They still only had one\nBurmese speaking moderator who wasn't even in the country, who was expected to keep\nall of this under control. And sure enough, a few months later Wirathu uses Facebook to\ntarget a Muslim tea shop telling lies about the owners and giving his followers\ntheir name and address. Hundreds of followers take to the street burning down Muslim owned\nbusinesses and killing two. - [Reporter] The\nviolence, mostly targeting the minority Rohingya community has killed more than 200 people\nand made 140,000 homeless. - [Johnny] Facebook\nstill wouldn't step in, so the Myanmar government\nhad to, they blocked Facebook in the city of Mandalay where\nthe violence was happening. It was the strongest warning yet that Facebook was indeed\ndriving violence in the country. This and more warnings from\nexperts was a wake up call but Facebook only ends up making promises but takes no aggressive\naction to stop hate speech on their platform, and\nthey continue to focus what they're good at,\ngrowth and expansion, the thing that will make them money. In 2016, a think tank in\nWashington DC releases a report that analyzes 32,000\nFacebook accounts in Myanmar. These were accounts of everyday users, and the report found that these accounts were overwhelmed with hateful\nmessages against the Rohingya. And just when you think that\nFacebook's enabling role couldn't get any worse, the military of Myanmar\njoins the platform. They create pages\npretending to be news sites or beauty and lifestyle pages. They gain huge followings and then they sprinkle in propaganda. They amplify the tensions\nbetween Buddhists and Rohingya. They post graphic photos of corpses, saying that the Rohingya were attacking, that jihadist attacks would\nbe carried out any day. And the conspiracies kept\ngetting more and more extreme. - Oh yeah, the Muslims in my village are Stockpiling guns at\nthe behest of Saudi Arabia, and they're going to take over unless we go and kill them first. And it would get thousands of shares. - [Johnny] So what we're\nlooking at is Facebook not just amplifying hate speech posted by the average\ncitizen or by extremists, but the platform being used as a tool of psychological warfare by a military trying to create fear and\nmistrust in its own people. It was a giant escalating mob\nhatred towards the Rohingya which wasn't new in Myanmar. These ethnic tensions go back decades but it was different now\nbecause the mob in this case wasn't just someone's\nvillage or community, it was the entire country,\nbeing viewed through the lens of a technology that\nserves up the most extreme and engaging content, that polarizes in the name of engagement. It was a ticking time bomb one that went off in 2016 and 2017. Because the Rohingya\ninsurgents were fighting back, in 2016, the military starts performing what they call clearance operations. Going village to village,\nburning down homes, and driving the Rohingya out. These clearance operations lead to the death of hundreds of Rohingya. 90,000 more people are\nforced to flee their home over the border to a\nrefugee camp in Bangladesh. And once again, they meet\nlittle to no pushback from their government or\nthe international community. They now had a playbook. It was a new level of violence, not just from the polarized people, but now from the military itself. Seeing this violence break out. In early 2017, David Madden who ran a tech startup in Myanmar, traveled to Facebook headquarters to give them a final\nwarning that their platform is spreading hate, and that\nthe situation in Myanmar is getting really bad. This was his second time\ndelivering such a warning but like all the others\nbefore him, he was ignored. A few months later,\nit's the summer of 2017 and Wirathu is at it again,\nvisiting Rakhine State where the Rohingya lived. Delivering one of his\nsignature hateful sermons, which is being amplified by local media and of course his following on Facebook. The next month, Rohingya\ninsurgents launch another attack on security forces in Rakhine State. The attacks lead to 12\nsecurity personnel deaths. (despondent music) And this was the final justification that the military was looking for, to do what they had been\nplanning and plotting for years. It happened quickly and violently. Armed men marched from village to village across Rakhine State in one\nof these clearance operations. They were joined by civilians\nfeeling more justified in their racism than ever. - [Reporter] It's a chilling\nand detailed account of what can only be described\nas a premeditated massacre. - [Johnny] And together the\nmilitary and the civilians kicked down doors, they\nburned down homes and mosques. They killed indiscriminately, committing horrific acts of violence. The rampage was widespread and systematic - [Reporter] Rohingya\nvillagers had fled in terror when troops and their\nown Buddhist neighbors rampaged into (indistinct)\nand then torched it. - [Johnny] Hundreds of\nvillages burned to the ground. This geo data obtained\nthrough satellite imagery shows the areas that\nwere burned and destroyed by this extermination campaign. And it helps us see just\nhow widespread this was. It was swift and violent,\nit was systematic, and it was an effort\nled out by the military and joined by local people\nwho had been radicalized for years by anti Rohingya propaganda. More and more of it being\nspread throughout the country by the unmonitored algorithms of Facebook. Tens of thousands of Rohingya killed and over 700,000 fleeing for their lives, ending up in a refugee camp in Bangladesh. To outside observers, this event might have looked\nlike spontaneous violence but this was actually the\nresult of a coordinated campaign by a few key people with\naccess to technology that allowed them to reach millions. To lie to them in the most hateful ways, to warp their realities. It was a full scale ethnic cleansing and it was in part fueled and enabled by an ungoverned social media platform. Even after the violence, the Burmese military\ncontinued to use Facebook writing one post that said\nthat the Rohingya problem had actually been an unfinished job that had finally been solved. And by solved he means\nthe organized murder of tens of thousands of innocent people, and the forced expulsion of\nalmost a million of them. The UN would refer to this campaign as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. Others used the word genocide. And only after this horrific event did Facebook actually respond. It wasn't until 2018 when they\nfinally took down the pages of senior military officials\nwho were spreading lies and calls to violence on their platform. The UN came in to\ninvestigate how this happened how another genocide\nhappened on our watch. And they concluded that\nFacebook had been quote, \"A useful instrument for\nthose seeking to spread hate.\" They also noted that Facebook\ndeclined to share with them data that would've helped\nwith their investigation. (crowd screaming) In 2021, these military leaders who were responsible for\nthis ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people, they\ntook over the country again. They removed the elected\ngovernment in yet another coup. Kutupalong, the refugee camp in Bangladesh now holds over 1 million people. Most of them Rohingya fleeing the violence\nin their home country. The government of Bangladesh wants to return them to Myanmar,\nbut international observers and the Rohingya themselves say that there's no way\nthey could do that safely. After all, the government in power is the one that massacred them. Returning to Myanmar now would\nbe more dangerous than ever. So they sit in their refugee camp without a country and without support, which is why we are raising as much money as we can to support them. Facebook claims that they\nchanged their practices since the massacre of 2017,\nbut in 2022, just last year Global Witness did an investigation and they were able to\nplace ads on Facebook that contained hateful messages\nin the Burmese language. Facebook didn't reject any of those ads where as here in the\nUnited States or in Brazil, Facebook seems to have real\ncontrols for hateful ads, but it appears not in\nMyanmar even after all this. This story in some ways\nis specific to Myanmar. It's a country that had\nbeen closed off to the world for a long time. It opened up, it was newly\nconnected to the internet, and soon longstanding tensions between ethnic groups exploded. But in other ways, this is a\nstory about humans everywhere about how we've chosen\nto build our society around technology and\nsocial media platforms that are supposed to\nconnect us, and they do. And yet in the process we've learned just how much they also create division, spread disinformation, and limit our ability to\nlive in a shared reality. It's a story about how that\nprocess, that trade-off, can have deadly consequences. (despondent music)"

    "captions": "There's one map you have to see to understand this conflict between Hamas and Israel. Gaza is this small strip of land that has 2 million Palestinians living in it. After a short war in the \u201860s Israel captured a bunch of land. The map went from looking like this to this. Israel eventually gave Sinai back to Egypt, but they continued to occupy this small strip of land called Gaza. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza and turned it over to the authority of the Palestinians. It was quickly taken over by this anti-Israel group called Hamas, which gets us back to this map. As soon as Hamas took over Israel and to lesser extent, Egypt started controlling everything that went in and out of this strip. So since Hamas has launched these rocket land and sea attacks, Israel has used this blockade to cut off the 2 million Palestinians living here from fuel, food and supplies. Their power plant has run out of gas and it is a horrible humanitarian situation. All of this is yet another chapter in this decades long pattern of Israeli occupation and Palestinian resistance, much of it peaceful, but some of it like this horrifically violent."

It's an important reminder that the movement for the liberation of Palestinians is very different than this violent terrorizing group called Hamas. The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. They simply want freedom and dignity and autonomy. And yet their land has been sliced up, built on and is under constant control and surveillance by Israeli military and citizens. When I was reporting in the West Bank, I saw that this is also a form of violence. It is a quieter and less flashy form of violence, it doesn\u2019t make the same kind of news, but it is violence nonetheless. And yet it in no way justifies what Hamas has done in launching these attacks. These protests remind us that there is a bigger, more legitimate movement at play here one that should not be conflated with Hamas and their horrible actions in the last few days."

These rockets and their parts mostly come from other countries like Iran and Syria. Historically, they've made their way into the country through this network of tunnels. Israel's always finding these tunnels and trying to shut them down. But they certainly still exist. They also do this thing where a ship off shore will drop a floating capsule full of weapons and it will be picked up by these scuba fighters. One way or another, they use these black market smuggling techniques to get these rockets into the country and they build up a huge arsenal and then they kind of release them all at once, which is what they recently did starting this new war.

    "captions": "- [Astronaut] Four forward,\ndrifting the right a little. 30 seconds. Looks like Neil is\ncoming in fine by there. 11, Mike, see you in the background. - [Johnny] If you don't\nbelieve that humans ever landed on the moon,\nyou'd probably think that on July 16th, 1969, a select\ngroup of government officials, a crew of filmmakers sworn to secrecy, and a famed Hollywood director\nnamed Stanley Kubrick, all gathered on a sound\nstage in a military base, deep in the Nevada desert,\nbetter known as Area 51. And here, they pulled off\nthe greatest hoax in history. You'd probably think that astronauts, or should I say actors,\nBuzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins\nfled this rocket through a secret passageway just\nbefore it took off for space, totally empty, and you\nwould have to believe that the estimated 400,000\npeople who were involved in this mission were in on it, all promising to take this\nsecret to their grave. 22% of Americans either don't believe that we landed on the\nmoon or harbor some doubt. - [Narrator] To advance the\ntechnology of space flight. - [Johnny] We looked at the\ntapes and the countless photos. We talked to astrophysicists,\nmeteorologists, and NASA historians to better understand the Moon Landing\nConspiracy, how it started, what hoaxers use as their evidence, and what this belief teaches us about why some conspiracies are so enduring. (mysterious music) - [Astronaut] We are go for launch! Houston, we are good in one minute. Launch sequence engaged, we are go. Liftoff, we have liftoff. - Okay, um, real quick. One of the big revolutions\nin science in recent decades is an understanding of our minds. We have learned more and more that our minds are actually just\nan organ called our brain that are like any other muscle. They can be trained, and\nretrained, and redirected, and that doing so dramatically\nchanges how we see the world and how we experience the world. This has led to the whole\nfield of mental health, which is honestly not much\ndifferent than physical health. With physical health, we do exercise to, like, keep our bodies strong. With mental health, we're learning that you can also do exercise. It's called therapy. I've been doing therapy\nnow for several years, and I can say with total confidence that it is a life-changer. I mean, I've reshaped how I see the world and how I deal with difficult things. We all have difficult things. And all of this brings me to\nthe sponsor of today's video, who is BetterHelp. BetterHelp is a platform\nthat is making therapy more accessible to millions of\npeople thanks to technology. Unlike the traditional way\nof finding a therapist, which often involves calling people, and going to doctor's offices,\nand sitting in waiting rooms, with BetterHelp, you just\nsign up, take a quiz, you tell BetterHelp who you are, what you're struggling with,\nwhat you would like to achieve, what you wanna change about your mind, and then BetterHelp\npairs you with somebody in their giant network\nof tens of thousands of licensed therapists. You can talk to them by video chat, you can talk to them by\nphone, which is what I do, I do phone therapy, or you\ncan talk to them by text if you don't want to\nactually speak to somebody. If your therapist isn't a good fit, you can change and pick someone\nelse in their giant network. For me, mental health\nis now non-negotiable. I kind of am blown away\nthat I didn't do therapy for most of my life,\nbut now I'm in therapy, and I deeply appreciate it, it has changed the way I see the world. So I'm very grateful that BetterHelp is making therapy more accessible. I'm also grateful that\nthey support our channel and our journalism, and for\nsponsoring today's video. There's a link in my description, it's BetterHelp.com/JohnnyHarris. When you click that link, it\nhelps support this channel, but it also gets you in on a discount.

Thank you, BetterHelp for making therapy more accessible to millions of people, for sponsoring today's video, for supporting our channel\nand our journalism. With that, let's dive back into this wild conspiracy theory\nof the moon landing. - [Reporter] Armstrong is on the moon. Neil Armstrong, standing\non the surface of the moon on this July 20th, 1969. - [Neil Armstrong] That's\none small step for man. - All right, so to give you some context on the moon landing, I\nneed to briefly explain World War II and the Cold War, which is something I've kind\nof done a lot on this channel. So instead of me doing it\nagain, we hired someone with an old-timey, like,\nradio transatlantic accent to do it instead. Buckle up for this one. - [David] In a world on\nthe brink of destruction, the United States of America\njoined the Allied Forces in the Second World War in 1941. The big three, the Soviet\nUnion, Great Britain, and now the USA versus the Axis powers, Italy, Japan, and Nazi Germany. They sure did put up a fight, but the Allied Powers\ncame out on top, you see. But then America and the USSR got real cold with each other. A tragic reversal of the old\ntales of enemies turned lovers. The communists found\nthe United States to be exceedingly aggressive\nand quite trigger happy with all their new military power, meddling in things they ought to be keeping their noses out of. Across the pond, the\ncapitalist United States was fearful that the USSR was hankering to spread their communism\nacross the whole globe. The war remained cold\nonly because both powers had thousands of the most deadly weapons humanity had ever seen and wouldn't dare use them against each other. It was something of a\nhorrifying stalemate. Soon, the empires turned\nto other feats of strength, psychological warfare,\nspying, sports, proxy wars, and a race to advance their technologies. And to top it all, a race like no other, a race to space. - At first, it is very\nclear that the Soviets are winning the race. They're launching dogs\nand plants into space and bringing them back alive. They send up satellites\nthat orbit the moon and take photos of the far side\nthat no one had seen before. They even put a human up into space to orbit around the entire earth. - [Narrator] The first space flight would be made by a Soviet man. - The US needs to catch\nup, so President Eisenhower creates a brand new government agency dedicated entirely to space, and they eventually start\nto send up satellites, and even people, but\nthey don't get someone to orbit the entire Earth\nlike the Russians did. Womp-womp, the US is\nlosing the space race. And this is where JFK gets\nup in front of the nation and declares that the\nUS is setting a goal. - In this decade, we shall\nmake up and move ahead. - He's declaring what would surely be the ultimate finish line in\nthis global race for power. - We choose to go to\nthe moon in this decade! - [Johnny] An American astronaut eventually orbits the earth. - Not because they are easy! - [Johnny] Russia then puts\nthe first woman in space while also getting the first\nperson to walk in space. - But because they are hard! - [Johnny] The NASA teams\nare pulling all-nighters year after year, trying to figure out how they're gonna make\ngood on JFK's big promise to somehow get a man on the\nmoon by the end of the decade. Things are heating up, time\nis running out, and then... - [Astronaut] Launch\nsequence engaged, we are go. (fire roaring) (explosion booming) (muffled speaking through radio) - [Johnny] NASA's disaster\nwas a major setback, but the stakes were too high to give up. The Space Race had become much more than a technological rivalry. Winning the race to the moon would mean winning the ideological war for the world. Would it be communism or capitalism? They couldn't give up\nnow, so they kept going. (intense electronic music) In 1968, NASA finally gets\na spaceship, the Apollo 8, to orbit the moon with astronauts aboard. There's hope. Russia is able to\nexchange a crew in space. For both sides, a moon trip\nsuddenly seems within reach, but who will get there first? - I, Richard Milhous\nNixon, do solemnly swear. (\"Hail to the Chief\") - [Johnny] And then, after\nhundreds of millions of dollars and countless focused hours by the country's brightest minds, comes a morning on a summer\nday in Houston, Texas in 1969. - [Astronaut] Ten... - [Johnny] Three men buckle up. Hundreds of millions of\npeople around the world find themselves glued\nto their television sets because the greatest achievement\nof mankind might happen. Then starts the five... - [Johnny And Astronaut]\nFour, three, two... - [Astronaut] One, zero. All engines running. Liftoff, we have a liftoff! 32 minutes past the hour,\nliftoff on Apollo 11! Tower cleared! - [Astronaut 2] We got a roll program. - [Neil Armstrong] Neil\nArmstrong reporting their roll and pitch program, which puts Apollo 11 on a proper heading. - [Astronaut] Rolls complete\nand a pitch is program. (emotional music) - [Johnny] The rocket heads\ntowards the finish line, that pearly orb that humans have stared at and mythologized about, fixated on, and they're finally gonna touch it. - [George Bailey] Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso\naround it and pull it down. - [Johnny] Four days\nand 200,000 miles later, it's July 20th, 1969, months\nbefore JFK's deadline was up. Two of the three astronauts disconnect from the orbiting ship and\ndescend onto the moon's surface. And then... - [Michael Collins] There you go. - [Neil Armstrong] Oh, it's\nbeautiful, Mike, it really is. (Johnny exhaling sharply) - These fumes. The race had clearly been won. A line had been crossed, not just for the global\nsuperpower who did this, but for all humans who had just taken their obsession for\nexploration to new heights. But right away, after this event, even though it was\nbroadcast on live television for the whole world to see,\nthere were rumblings of doubt. About a year after the landing, you start to see newspaper articles casting doubt that any of\nthis actually happened. Two years after the\nlanding, we see James Bond running away from a\nbunch of security guards through the Nevada desert\nwhen he somehow stumbles upon a secret moon landing\nfilm set, resulting in this moon buggy car chase\nthing through the desert. It was all a tongue-in-cheek reference to this budding conspiracy\nthat the whole thing was faked. A few years later, a\nformer US Navy officer and Apollo Rocket technical\nwriter comes out with this book. - [Bill] I think it was\nan intuitive feeling that what was being shown was not real. - [Johnny] The book is a\nlong evaluation of evidence that claims that we never\nactually went to the moon. This book makes the case\nthat the moon landing was so political that the\nUS, having failed to develop a feasible plan to get to the moon, pulled off this secretive\nstaging of the event, all as a propaganda play to\nget ahead of the Soviets. And he emphasizes the\npoint that, you know, it's the Cold War, it's\nnot that farfetched that the US government would come up with some deception campaign in\nthe name of beating communism, which is, like, totally fair, actually. But that's not evidence,\nthat's just speculation. He does go on to present a\nbunch of photos and explanations that turn into the foundation\nof what would become a widespread theory that\nthe moon landing was faked. - The lunar landings were\nmore than likely fabricated. - Why wouldn't the moon\nlanding be fake, you know? Why wouldn't we fake that? - We did not land men on the moon. - The moon? Yeah, it's fake. - And I would bet my life on it. - This is actually the reason\nI wanted to make this video, is I wanted to understand\nwhat the foundation of this conspiracy theory actually was. The people who truly earnestly believe it, what do they think happened here? I'm not gonna go through\nall of the evidence and theories here because they're kind of all over the place, but let me show you some of the major ones. The first major one starts here. - [Theorist] How come there\naren't any stars in this photo? There's no atmosphere or\nlight pollution on the moon. Shouldn't this photo look like this? - Well, it turns out that if\nyou want to capture the stars, even on the moon, you have\nto open up your camera for a very long time and\nlet a bunch of light in. Trust me, I know this because\nI spent months of my life trying to photograph a galaxy, and I learned a lot about\nhow not to photograph stars, and let me just tell you, it's\na lot harder than it looks. When I was doing that, I\nwas opening up my shutter for 30 seconds, and I\ntook hundreds of images just to get this one shot. So when you're on the bright moon, and you're trying to\nphotograph a bunch of guys in bright white reflective suits, you're not opening up your\nshutter for a very long time, you're not letting in a bunch of light. There's basically no chance\nof getting a decent shot of the stars in this environment. But you get something, I mean, if you take the photo and\nblast up the brightness, you can kind of see some\ntraces of the stars, if you really need to do that. - [Theorist] Okay, but\nwhat about these shadows? Some of these shadows go this\nway and some go this way. Shouldn't the shadows be parallel if they're all coming\nfrom one source, the sun? - [Johnny] Yes, the only\nlight source in this photo is the sun. But you have to remember that\nlight bounces off things, especially white things. So you have light bouncing off of lots of different surfaces, which is one reason the\nshadows look a little weird. Oh, and remember that\nyou're looking at light that was filtered through a lens. A camera lens distorts\nthe direction of things, depending on how wide or tight it is. - [Theorist] Okay, but\nwhat about this flag? This flag is waving, but\nthere's no wind on the moon. - Yes, the flag is kind of waving, but remember that this\nisn't a normal flag. NASA had to make a custom\nflag for the Apollo missions that had a horizontal rod right up here so that the flag wouldn't look like this. It had to look nice, and\nAmerican, and patriotic. You had to be able to see it. So when the astronauts\nwere sticking the flag in the lunar soil, the motion of that movement\ncaused the material to move, and it kind of looks like it's waving. - [Theorist] Okay, but\nlook how they're moving. This is so unnatural. It's almost like they're\nbeing pulled up by a wire. Oh, and look, did you catch that? That looks like a wire! - Okay, wait, just, confession here, I was watching all of these\nconspiracy documentaries, like, while we're doing this story, and they're, like, incredibly tantalizing. This is the one that\nactually kind of got me. I was like, \"Wait a minute,\nthey are moving really weird.\" The motion is so off-kilter, it looks like they're being,\nlike, dragged by a wire. So to figure this out, we actually talked to a\nphysicist and a meteorologist who helpfully explained just how different life in one-sixth Earth's gravity is. I mean, think about it. Our intuition for everything we know is calibrated to Earth's gravity. It's everything we've ever known. It's how our brains interpret the world, it's how our muscles\ncalibrate to the world, so when you're watching these\nvideos of these astronauts in suits that weigh 180\npounds, clunking around with their Earth gravity-trained\nmuscles on the moon, you see some really weird movements. But, I mean, who knows? Maybe the two scientists we\ntalked to are actually in on it. Maybe they're some of the\nhalf million Americans who were paid by the government\nto keep the hoax alive. All that we could feel like America is better than the Soviet Union in 1969. Maybe, could be. Okay, listen, I'm not gonna go through every single one of these theories. There's a lot of \"evidence\" out there, like why isn't there\nexhaust on this flame? Or why did the Eagle\nLander not leave a crater? What about the radiation exposure that these astronauts would've gotten? What about Neil Armstrong's\nboot print or the lost tapes? Don't get me started on the lost tapes. We actually had a whole\nsection in the script about the lost tapes, and ultimately, it didn't make the cut. Now listen, I want it to be clear that you should not be\nashamed if you actually want answers to these questions,\nespecially in a time where all of us are kind of renegotiating our relationship with trust\nin governmental institutions. But I will tell you that\nafter earnestly looking into this stuff, none of the presented evidence comes anywhere close to the\nburden of proof and evidence I would need to see to believe that the moon landing was a hoax. I will put resources in our source doc of the many instances of\nastrophysicists and scientists walking you through all this stuff. I think it's useful to look at. Before we move on with our\nstory of the conspiracy theory, let me use this moment to say\na word about human neurology and visual information,\nsomething I think about a lot. For me, when I sit through\nthe evidence-based debunk on these theories, which is\nsomething we did for this story, it helps me understand the\nlimits of human senses. Our eyes, and ears, and\nlogical thinking brains were optimized for very different problems than evaluating the physics\nof our fellow homo sapiens jumping around on a baby\nplanet 200,000 miles away. Like, we're not set up for this stuff. Going through the conspiracy theory, and then going through the debunks, reminds me why we as a species developed other ways of sensing, other ways of measuring and\nknowing things about the world, other tools that aren't\nas intuitive to us, but that extend our power to\nknow things that are real, that are true. If you don't lean on these\ntools, in other words, if you don't look to\nscience in your evaluation, and instead rely on your optic nerve feeding grainy pixels\ninto your great ape brain, I think we can all agree\nthat you'll take for truth things that are not true. Okay, neurology section is over. Let's get back to it. If you're gonna go down this rabbit hole and indulge your conspiracy\nmind like I did for this story, let's talk about what people\nthink actually happened here. Like, all of this footage\nand all of these photos, What do the moon hoaxers\nthink we're looking at? One of the most common explanations is that the US, afraid that\nthey would be embarrassed in front of the global stage\nbecause they would fail on JFK's big promise, hired\na famed Hollywood director, Stanley Kubrick, who had just\nreleased a groundbreaking space movie, and they\nused his visual skills to deceive the world,\nfilming the moon landing on a sound stage in the\nmiddle of the desert. I mean, look, this rock\nhas a perfect C on it! Is that a prop? These misaligned shadows,\nthey explain as studio lights. The flag was waving because there was air conditioning in the studio, and these photos were actually taken by Stanley Kubrick's crew. All of these movements they say were done with wires and slow motion. And that black, starless sky\nis just a black cloth backdrop. - [Neil Armstrong] That's\none small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. - [Johnny] In 1977, the conspiracy\ntheory had spread enough that NASA had to come out\nand issue a fact sheet responding to the claims. The first sentence of which is just, \"Yes, astronauts did land on the moon.\" But then a movie comes out in 1977 about the government\nfaking a space mission, this time to Mars, to save\nface to the American people. But the Space Race was over,\nit wasn't the focus anymore. And eventually, so was the Cold War. This moon landing theory\nbecame more and more fringe. But inevitably, like any other good, tantalizing conspiracy theory, it was eventually repackaged and put into one of these really spooky,\ncheesy cable news documentaries. In 2001, Fox News aired this documentary. - [Narrator] On \"Conspiracy Theory.\" Did we land on the moon? - [Johnny] It was basically\njust a repackaging of all the old theories,\nbut for a new audience. But now, it was the dawn\nof the internet age, and NASA had to respond\nto this Fox News doc by reissuing the fact sheet\nthat they issued in 1977, but this time on a website. An innocent foreshadow\nto combating information on the internet. They had no idea what was coming. The doc gave the conspiracy\nnew energy, new followers, and soon, a conspiracy theorist was following Buzz Aldrin around a hotel, pestering him and demanding\nhim to swear on the Bible that he landed on the moon. And buzz punched him in the face. Shortly after that, a French\nmockumentary came out, laying out \"evidence\" that Stanley Kubrick did film the moon landing. The problem is, people\nthought it was real. - [Joe Rogan] There's a fake documentary, not a real documentary, but\na fake, like a mockumentary, where he's admitting and\npeople are talking about- Have you seen that one? - [Greg Fitzsimmons] No,\nbut that makes sense. - [Joe Rogan] Yeah, a\nlot of people are like, \"Dude, you didn't even know? There's an actual, real interview with him where he admits that he\nfaked the moon landing!\" But it's not.\n- [Greg Fitzsimmons] Yeah. - It's just, it's fake. - [Johnny] So today,\nthe conspiracy lives on, in a world of increasing\nscience skepticism and on an internet that\nfuels pretend information, and to a demographic that\nis more and more mistrusting of institutional knowledge. One poll found that in 2019,\n11% of American millennials believed that the moon landing was staged. It's become a particularly\ndurable conspiracy theory because it has all of the ingredients of a good conspiracy theory. It's shadowy government\nantagonist with political motives, it leans on the human eye and brain as the primary measuring\ntool for the evidence, and when you believe in stuff like this, it feels good, like you're in on a secret. So let me just end this\nvideo by telling you why I know we landed on the moon. - [Narrator] You are looking\nat a very thin section of moon rock, magnified 500 times. - [Johnny] First off, we\nbrought back 900 pounds of rocks during the Apollo missions. The Soviets, who were our technological and geopolitical enemies,\neventually sent a robot to the moon to collect\nsamples of their own. These precious rocks are\nsent out to scientists and educators 400 times a year\nto be studied and examined, and it has been verified by\na lot of different people who have no motive to lie that these rocks were developed in an environment\ncompletely rid of oxygen. Also, the Soviets themselves\ncorroborated the moon landing and acknowledged that it happened. I mean, the Soviet leader kind\nof begrudgingly complimented the US, and they published,\nlike, a tiny little blurb in one of their newspapers, but, like, they lost and\nthey admitted they lost. Also, if I'm gonna rely on\njust my human brain logic for a second here, think about it, there were hundreds of thousands of people who were involved in the Apollo missions, scientists, engineers,\nphysicists, policymakers, mathematicians, all working\nday to night towards this goal, obsessing over every\ndetail and then monitoring every step of the way from Houston, Texas, to the surface of the moon and back, communicating with the\nastronauts the whole time. So imagine two Texas\nMotor Speedway stadiums full of the brightest\nminds in the country, all in on the biggest\ndeception of all time without a single leak. And finally, if you insist\non using your eyeballs as your only sensors that\nyou'll accept as proof, just look at this. This photo was taken by a\ntelescope orbiting the moon. These are astronaut and buggy tracks, here on the surface of the moon. You can even see the buggy's\nparking spot right here. And if you think that this photo, that, yes, was originally taken by NASA, but many other photos have come\nup by other space stations, that show physical evidence\nof humans on the moon, if you think that this\nis still the government, like, 40 years later,\nthe kids and grandkids of the Apollo people, still\nPhotoshopping pictures to keep up this elaborate ruse, I don't know what would convince you. (cheerful piano music) Hey everyone, thanks for watching. This was a fun video to work\non and we have so much archive. Like, luckily there's\namazing footage for this and we got to use a\nteaspoon of it for this, but really, we'll put some\nlinks in the description and in the source doc for a\nplace you can go to look at all of this amazing\nfootage and photography. I want to quickly tell\nyou about The Newsroom, which is our Patreon,\nwhere all of you support the journalism we're doing here. You can go to The\nNewsroom and get access to a behind-the-scenes vlog\nthat we do every month, so it is an insight into\neverything we do here. You can meet the team,\nyou can see the process of how we are building this\njournalism studio on YouTube. You also get access to my scripts, you get access to Tom Fox music that you can use royalty-free, and it's just a way that you can support the journalism we're trying to do here. You also can check out the new\nposter that we just launched. It is called All Maps Are Wrong. I designed it with the\nhelp of some of my friends, and it is something I've been\nwanting to do for a long time. It has all of the map projections that are the way that we take\nthe Earth, which is a sphere, and put it onto a flat\nplane, which is called a map. And in doing so, you\nstretch the map inevitably, and it means that all maps are wrong. And this poster is kind\nof an homage to that. We have LUTs and presets, which is how we color\nour photos and videos, and we recently launched a tip line, a place where we can hear from you on what stories you think we should tell, whether you have access to\nspecific data, or evidence, or knowledge that you think would make a compelling story, or an investigation that needs to be done, or just a story that you think is under-covered\nand that needs explanation. Information about that\nis in the description. We always love to hear from\nyou to make our reporting more holistic, more\nrepresentative, and stronger. So thank you for your submissions, thank you all for being here, I will see you in the next one. (Wallace sighing) (record crackling)"

And it's one of the most ambitious attacks in a really long time. The rockets were fired by a group called Hamas, which refuses Israel's right to even exist. For decades, Hamas has protested Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory by launching missiles from this small slice of Palestine down here called the Gaza Strip. But this attack was more deadly than normal. It's killed at least 700 Israelis, most of them civilians and thousands more wounded. Israel immediately declared war against Hamas and the Israeli air force began dropping bombs, killing hundreds of Palestinian civilians. They\u2019re activating 300,000 of their reservists to get ready to fight. They're promising that this is just the beginning.

    "captions": "(gentle dramatic music) - Your olive oil may not\nbe what it claims to be. claims to be. - [Johnny] A couple years\nago in southern Italy the police were spying on\nan organized crime network. (Person speaking Italian) - [Johnny] Their undercover footage shows these large tanker trucks\npassing into their compound. They started tracking\nthese trucks with GPS and found that the trucks\nwere loaded with oil. They were delivering this oil to markets and restaurants in Germany. They were selling it to buyers who thought that they were buying high quality extra virgin olive oil from the best olive regions in the world. (suspenseful music) After many months of this investigation the police finally\nbusted into the compound and what they found is\nthat these criminals were importing cheap seed oil that cost them just\nover one euro per liter, but then they were coloring\nit with like chlorophyll to make it look like olive oil. They even had the machinery\nto bottle this oil and to label it with the important words extra virgin olive oil with a nice little Italian flag on it. At the height of their operation they were selling around\n23,000 liters per week to customers in the north\nfor 5 to 10 times the cost that they bought this cheap seed oil for. The police estimated that\nthey were bringing in around 8 million euros a year. In the end, 24 people were arrested and 150,000 liters of fake\nolive oil were seized. (Reporter speaking Italian) (gentle music) - Good olive oil is really hard to make. It's delicate, it's hard\nto ship across the world but when you get the real\nstuff, extra virgin olive oil it's really healthy and delicious. And from the mafia in southern Italy to mainstream olive oil brands\non your grocery store shelf olive oil is full of fraud and deception. In fact, there's a chance that you've never actually\ntasted extra virgin olive oil, even if you think you have. So let me show you how this happened and why it even matters. And how you can get in on the real stuff, real extra virgin olive oil. 'Cause I'm telling you, when\nyou do, when you taste this, it's unlike any substance on earth. (upbeat music) I've been working out lately,\nlike I can do 10 pull-ups, which when I started this\njourney like 10 months ago I could do one, now I can do 10. and that's because of CoPilot. CoPilot is this platform where you get paired up with\na personal fitness coach and you communicate\nwith that fitness coach via a very well designed app. My coach is named Devyn and he's great and I've told him all about my goals. I wanna be able to lift my body, I want to just have a\nworkout that's approachable and not like grueling and he designed a custom\nworkout step by step. So every day when it's time to work out I open up this app, I press start workout, it fires it up on my watch and on my phone and I start working out, I\njust follow the instructions. There's like video\ndemonstrations of each step so that it's crystal clear and then it moves you\non to the next activity. What this does is, number one it gives you a real person\nto stand accountable to which is just so much better\nthan like a YouTube video that you're like watching and no one else knows\nthat you're working out. CoPilot found that people\nare nine times more likely to stick to a workout routine\nif there's a real person that they have to stand accountable to. Nine times, which is\nactually not that surprising, it it makes sense. Number two, it allows you\nto customize a workout exactly to what you want. Oh, and at the end of every workout I'm able to give feedback\nto my coach Devyn and be like, \"Hey Devyn, I think it was too easy today on the arms. Can we make it harder?\" And he the next day has coded in a new workout that is harder on the arms. The other thing this does\nis it takes away ambiguity. Like I think the killer of\nmotivation is ambiguity. Like you're like, \"So\nwhat do I start with?\" And with CoPilot, you just press a button and it tells you what to start with, which for me at like six in the morning when I'm working out because\nI need to to be happy, I don't want to think, I\njust want to get it done. And CoPilot makes that happen\nbecause of its very fancy app. I try my best to actually use the products that I endorse here on this channel. Obviously this is a business, I need to sponsor these videos so that we can make good journalism, but also like I've used this for 10 months and I can vouch for it, it's\na pretty dang good product. So there's a link in my description. It is go.mycopilot.com/Johnny-Harris, just click the link, it\nhelps support this channel, but it also gives you 14 days for free with your own personal fitness coach. So that you can design your own workout and have somebody to stand accountable to and make those workout\ngoals actually come true. Thank you CoPilot for\nempowering me to do 10 pull-ups and for existing and for\nsponsoring today's video. Let's get back to our story\nabout the mafia and olive oil. (upbeat music) Most olive oil in the world is made here in these sunny climates\nof the Mediterranean. Thousands of years ago,\npeople here figured out that juicing the fruit\nof this ancient tree produces a golden oil that's like magic. They adored this tree. Its branches were worn\nby the goddess of peace or a victorious olympian. It was an olive branch that told Noah that the flood was over. Over the centuries it became a sacred tree with a sacred fruit that\nproduced a sacred liquid. It was food, it was medicine, it was fuel, it was a cosmetic, it was a\nkey part of religious rituals for people of the Mediterranean\nfor thousands of years. The rest of the world didn't know much about this special oil until the 1960s when an American doctor was\nconducting a health study of over 13,000 middle aged\nmen from seven countries. He found that the people of\nItaly and Greece lived longer and were generally healthier, despite being ravaged by war and poverty. He concluded that it must\nbe because of what they ate, fish, nuts, vegetables, and, of course, copious amounts of olive\noil instead of butter. (upbeat music) Soon word spread to the rest of the world that this Mediterranean diet\nwas the way to live longer and that olive oil was a key ingredient. It's the '70s and '80s and everyone is talking about olive oil. - Major health headline here tonight and it involves a very popular diet, the Mediterranean diet full of olive oil. - Olive oil. - Olive oil - Extra virgin olive oil. - What is the best olive oil? - A little olive oil, or\nif you like use a lot. - Between 1958 and 2019, global production of olive oil tripled. Demand in the United States exploded. Olive oil is no longer a regional thing. By the 1990s this has become a huge international supply chain Serving customers around the\nworld who are willing to pay, to pay a lot more for this\nextra virgin olive oil. The stuff that scientists was saying was an elixir of health and longevity. - You can combine what\nis beneficial for health to what is really taste. And people, of course, they are quick to grasp the importance\nof combining good food with good health. - [Johnny] Suddenly these\nsmall olive oil operations in rural parts of southern Italy have international customers clamoring to get in on their product. So they start selling\ntheir oil to middlemen who can take it and sell it to a co-op. The co-op gets all the oil together and then sells it to another co-op who eventually sells it to a company who bottles it and then ships\nit to a far away country to be put on grocery store shelves. This complex supply chain\nwith all these middlemen comes with a lot of opportunities for people to take advantage\nof this newfound love for this magical, expensive oil. But to understand olive oil fraud you first really have\nto understand the magic of extra virgin olive oil. (mysterious music) Every winter at farms\naround the Mediterranean farmers head to their groves\nto comb through the branches of these ancient trees\nat just the right time so that this delicate\nfruit is perfectly ripe as it falls to the ground\ncarpeting the grove floor. The clock immediately starts ticking. Within 24 hours they must\nget this precious fruit to the mill where the olives are crushed and then spun in a centrifuge\nuntil the oil is separated. No heat, no filters,\nno chemicals, nothing. Just high quality olives quickly\npressed one time and spun, then bottled, then crucially\nkept dark, kept cool, sealed and ideally consumed within 18 months. It's a delicate resource intensive\nprocess to pull this off, and even more so when you then have to\nship it across the globe. But it's really the only way\nto get this magical liquid that we call extra virgin olive oil. The stuff that's good for your heart, for your brain, for your bones. The stuff that tastes\nlike fatty grassy gold. This stuff is so good. And this is where I tell you that most olive oil is kind of a lie. Sometimes a white lie and other times a mafia is\ndeceiving you kind of lie. So first things first, Italian\nolive oil is important here. If you look at this price\ngraph of Italian olive oil you'll see that it's\nquite a bit more expensive than the olive oil coming\nfrom the other big players in this space, Spain and Greece. Italian olive oil is more expensive, not only because it is\nknown for genuine quality, but also because it's Italy. Italy is Italy, it looks like this. It's food looks like this. Italy has the perception of being the gourmet food\nepicenter of the world. So people, including me,\nare willing to pay more for Italian extra virgin olive oil because it's good and it's from Italy. On that point, let me show\nyou two kind of insane maps. First look where most\nolive oil is made in Italy. It's the darker areas down here. And second, let's look\nat the regions of Italy where the mafia is most present. Right down here next to this\ntoe and the heel of the boot. The regions with the highest\nproduction of olive oil are the regions where the mafia is and this is where it all comes together. There's this ancient trading city right on the toe of the boot. (gentle dramatic music) The Calabrian Mafia, one of\nItaly's most influential clans controls this busy port in this city. They also control or influence much of the farmland in this\narea, including olive groves. In 2016, this mafia clan was\nshipping in cheap, low grade, chemically treated\nolive oil called pumice. They would then bottle this up and label it as extra\nvirgin olive oil from Italy even though it was like\na derivative of olive oil chemically treated and not from Italy. But then they would ship this olive oil to importers in New York\nCity, in Boston, in Chicago. Importers who thought they were buying the best olive oil in the world from the best region in the world. But really they were paying for cheap oil and giving huge profit margins to the mafia committing this fraud. The Italian food police, which\nis like literally a thing, eventually busted this scheme. - [Reporter] We arrest of\none of the most powerful street gangs in Calabria. - Olive oil is hard to detect as fake. It kind of all looks the same. You have to have a trained eye to know if like the color is off. Most people aren't drinking olive oil, they're cooking with it or\nputting it on their salad and they're kind of just\nassuming that it's legitimate and that it's giving them health benefits. And a lot of people don't really know what good olive oil tastes like. So olive oil fraud is particularly easy. And particularly lucrative, because of the premium price that good extra virgin olive oil commands. Because of this Italy has\nan entire investigative unit dedicated to food fraud, and they're regularly\nbusting these fraud schemes. Some of them are less extreme than the ones we've talked about. A really common one is people will ship in olive oil from Spain, they\nwill bottle it in Italy and then they will put a label that says that it's Italian olive oil and they will sell it at a higher premium because Italian olive oil\ncommands a higher price. But oftentimes it's even\nmore subtle than that. Olive oil companies will\nmix extra virgin olive oil with old or decaying oil\nor they'll use olives that have been sitting\non the floor of the grove for like a couple of weeks and they're like, eh, we will\njust like press them anyway and call it extra virgin olive oil. And it's not, it's a different thing. Again, this is a really\ncomplex supply chain with lots of opportunities\nfor people to step in and change it from this delicate liquid called extra virgin olive\noil to something else, and it's really hard to detect. A lot of this olive oil ends\nup on your supermarket shelf with a photo of a humble Italian farmer in an idyllic landscape\nwith words like cold pressed or premium selection with\npretend stamps of approval that don't mean anything. I mean listen, these could all be legit\nextra virgin olive oils but I don't know because here in the US we actually have no enforcement standards. Luckily scientists have tested this. One of the first big tests on this was from researchers at UC\nDavis, a college in California. They went out and bought\na bunch of olive oil from stores in California. They tested them to see\nif they met the standards for extra virgin olive oil\nand they found that 69% of imported olive oil that was claiming to be extra virgin failed to meet the\ninternationally recognized sensory standards where\nan expert tastes it and can tell if it's\nactually extra virgin or not. And of those 31% failed to\nmeet the chemical standards, meaning they were too acidic. A lot of this stuff is not\nextra virgin olive oil. Now I'm sure I'm gonna get an email from people in the olive oil industry saying that this study\nisn't actually legit because it was only a sample size of olive oil in stores in California. But this was actually just\none of several studies over the years that have\nshown the same thing. Most of the olive oil on our shelves claiming to be that amazing golden liquid that is delicately produced and stored and contains the fullness of the taste and the health benefits of olives, AKA extra virgin olive oil, most of these labels are lying. Now most of the oil in these\nbottles does come from olives. Like there's not a lot of that fraud where they're like taking seed oil and pretending that it's olive oil that's been clamped down on. Still happens, but not very often. But again, it being made from olives is not what makes extra\nvirgin olive oil special. It is the way that it's made. It's the way that it's processed. It's how quickly they take\nthe fruit from the grove and they press it and bottle\nit and store it and ship it. This oil is not that. It is not extra virgin anymore. And yet they slap a\nlabel so that you and I feel like we're getting the best stuff and we're getting it for a good price. You would be in big\ntrouble if you got caught labeling it as such in Italy and a lot of European countries. But wait, why haven't these companies who are doing it in the United\nStates gotten in trouble? Because in America we don't care. Whereas in Italy they literally\nhave laws that are violated when you label something\nas extra virgin olive oil and it's not. Here in the US, we have no laws for this. Companies don't have\nto test their olive oil to prove that it's extra virgin. They can just import them and slap on extra virgin to the label and no one can do anything about it. Between this and the\nfact that most Americans probably don't know what extra virgin olive\noil even takes like so they don't know what to expect. The US has become what one expert calls the dumping grounds for olive oil that says it's extra virgin and it's not. So is there any hope here? Can you ever try the real stuff extra virgin olive oil that\nis like magical golden liquid? Yes you can. It exists. You just need to know what to look for. We put together a list of tips on how you can find legitimate\nextra virgins olive oil and know that you're\ngetting the good stuff. I'm gonna put the link in the description. It's everything from the material that the bottle is made out of to the nuances in the\npackaging and labeling and the date labeling, the quality seals. We also give you some ideas\non some of the trickery that companies try to fake it to try to make it look\nlegit but it's actually not. So that link is in a description. If you want to try extra virgin olive oil and get your hands on it and\nare willing to pay for it because spoiler alert it is more expensive than the fake stuff that's\npretending to be real, then you can go check out that doc and hopefully it's helpful. The point is that it is possible and I guess if you're still\nhere watching this video you're wondering why is this so important? Like why are we talking about\noil and olive oil fraud? And there are a couple answers. Number one is that this is a\nreally amazing old tradition. It's a tradition that\nfueled the civilizations in the Mediterranean\nfor thousands of years. The harvesting and pressing\nand bottling and consumption of olive oil, good olive oil\nis an old delicate tradition. And when you mix capitalism with that you often get a race to the the bottom on who can make it the cheapest\nand sell it for the cheapest so that they can make the most money. And inevitably you will get opportunistic people who try to trick you to make you think that it's the real thing so that you'll pay for it. And this hurts the producers who are actually doing the\nresource intensive process of harvesting and processing\nthis in the right way. And at the end of the day, to\nme, it is absolutely worth it. Good extra virgin olive oil\nis unlike anything else. A few years ago I discovered that I had never actually\ntasted extra virgin olive oil. So I bought my first bottle. It was kind of expensive, it was like $25 and I started using it on everything. I even started drinking it raw\njust to like get the flavor because I'm kind of weird\nand that's what I do and I'm sorry, but it's just delicious. And I started to understand\nwhy this stuff became so sacred for so many cultures in the Mediterranean. Why it's like a part of\nevery major religion. Why it has endured as a\nhealth and culinary staple. And I guess in knowing how\nvaluable this liquid is I actually understand why fraudsters and the mafia got involved here, why they tried to deceive us into thinking that we are consuming the most magical liquid on\nearth, even if we're not. (upbeat music) Thanks for watching the video. Am I too obsessed with olive oil? Is that a thing? Because I'm, I just really like it and I just had to make this video because I just am like I think this video was me being obsessed with olive oil and also me being so frustrated at when the international\neconomy like screws us over with opportunistic corporations. Like those two things coming\ntogether is what this video is. So thank you for watching. I hope you get in on the the how to buy good olive oil doc that we put together in the description. I wanna thank those who support\nus over at The Newsroom, which is our Patreon. We obviously do\nsponsorships for our videos, which is a major way that\nwe're able to do these. But in addition, The Newsroom has become a community of\npeople who wanna support the independent journalism\nwe're doing here and I'm deeply appreciative of that. Over on The Newsroom, you can get access to a\nbehind the scenes vlog that we do every month that\nintroduces you to the team shows you what we're up\nto, how we do what we do, just sort of gives you\na behind the scenes. And then you also get\naccess to my scripts. You get access to Tom\nFox music if you want but more importantly you get access to the warm fuzzy feeling\nthat you are supporting independent journalism on YouTube. So I think that's why most\npeople subscribe to The Newsroom, is because it is supporting\nthis kind of work. Other ways you can support,\nwe've got LUTs and Presets, which are how we color\nour videos and our photos. I made a map poster that I really like. That's super cool and fun. And if you have purchased it,\nplease tag me on Instagram so you can show me what it\nlooks like in your room. We launched a new channel that's probably a huge thing\nI should have said first. Search Party is a new\nchannel that is live now. We launched it with my\nold colleague from Vox, Sam Ellis, the creator of Vox Atlas. He now has his own channel and it is in collaboration with us and we are all working\ntogether now and it's awesome. So Search Party is live. I think those are all the\nthings I need to tell you here in this little end part of the video. I'm looking forward to\nhearing your thoughts and your comments. I always appreciate the back and forth and the dialogue and the\nfeedback, so keep that up. And thank you CoPilot for,\nfor sponsoring today's video. Thank you all for being here. I'll see you in the next one. (gentle music)"

We're talking about a region up here. It's called the Caucasus, these two countries, Azerbaijan and Armenia. There's been a lot of tension between these two about borders, which is why you have all these enclaves. One of these borders is right here. The region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Ethnic Armenians have lived here for decades and have been trying to make their own state within Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has tried to drive them out for decades. But Russia, who's just right up here, has been the one kind of keeping the peace, keeping stability between the two. But Russia has turned its attention towards its war in Ukraine. So Azerbaijan, with the support of their neighbor Turkey, has kicked out almost everyone in this enclave and pushed them into Armenia. And that's what we're looking at in this imagery. All of this is a sign of Russia's waning influence in the Caucasus and an increase of Turkey's influence there. If you want to better understand international politics, follow for more."

[TRUDEAU] potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing of a Canadian citizen. Let me explain why this is a big deal. Hardeep Singh Nijjar moved to Canada from India and was a leader of the Khalistan movement, an effort to create an independent state for Sikhs, a religious minority in northern India. The Indian government called this guy a terrorist and has been trying to arrest him for years. Nijjar found refuge in Canada, where nearly a million Sikhs live. That is, until recently, when he was gunned down by two men outside of a temple in Vancouver. India denied any involvement in this, but Justin Trudeau's accusation that India was involved means that there's at least some credible evidence here. But we just don't know yet. The whole thing is causing some real tension between the two countries. And it's right at a time when the West is trying to strengthen its relationship with India as part of its efforts to counterbalance China. So I guess now we just wait and see what evidence comes out.

These metals are key ingredients to making batteries, which we need a lot of very soon to get us away from this. Burning hydrocarbons to move our bodies and our goods around the world. One way to get all these metals is to send giant robots to the bottom of the ocean floor to vacuum up all of these deposits and then to send them up to the ship on the surface. But there's one big problem, which is that this patch of ocean isn't owned by any country. It's international waters. So countries are going to have to work together and establish rules on how to do this properly. And at this point, we don't know what the environmental implications are of just digging up all of these metals from the bottom of the ocean.

U.N. secretary general is calling this an epidemic of coups. And that's because when one military successfully overthrows their government and the international community doesn't really do anything, there's sort of a contagious effect. Where would be coup plotters in nearby countries feel emboldened to do the same thing. The reason why all of this is happening now is because of a real contagion called COVID-19, which really ruptured these fragile economies, leading to higher prices, dissatisfied people, and creating the perfect conditions for the military to come in and overthrow the government.

Let's say it's 2007 and you're the captain of a cargo ship traveling off the coast\nof the Horn of Africa. You're transporting wheat\nfrom Kenya to Saudi Arabia. When you look out at the ocean and you see these guys. They come at you quickly, just a small speedboat of them, and soon they're right up\nagainst the side of your ship. They're about to throw\na ladder to climb up. You run into the ship's\ncitadel, or safe room, and you call the Coast Guard. Or maybe you try to spray\nthem with this water hose to scare them away. But it's too late. They've now climbed on board. They're rounding up the crew. They're gonna hold you hostage and demand a ransom of millions of dollars for anyone who will pay. The shipping company, your\nhome government, your family, doesn't matter. And if you don't give them the money, you'll be held in captivity, starving, maybe even tortured for days, weeks, months, even years. - If there's no answer\nto payment of the ransom within three days, then the kidnappers here will sell me to Al-Shabaab. - [Johnny] This happened\nhundreds of times. This is what a typical hijacking\nin this region looked like in the early 2000's, where by the end of the decade, hundreds of piracy incidents\nwere reported every year and they were still just getting started. So let me show you how the Horn of Africa became the epicenter of modern-day piracy and how what started as Somali fishermen defending their waters turned into an organized criminal network. This is the rise and\nfall of Somali pirates. - [Reporter] Off the Somali coast where those pirates attacked that vessel. (pirate screaming) (aggressive electronic music) - [Commentator] You're dealing\nwith irrational people. - [Commentator] If your\nback is against the wall, I don't know what they are able to do. - Okay, little sidebar really quick. Yes, I'm wearing my orange jacket inside because it's kind of cold in the studio. Anyway. One of my least favorite parts about living in the internet age is how tracked I am and\nhow tracked we all are. I spend a lot of time on the internet, and when I do that, all of my data, all of\nmy browsing behavior, my purchase history, my address, my Social Security number,\nmy location history is scraped by some shadowy company and put onto a list and then bought and\nsold in an open market. This is why my inbox is chaos, why my phone is always\nblowing up with robocalls, why I'm constantly being marketed to and sent stuff to my\nhouse that I don't want. It's a nightmare and it's\ngetting worse every year. People's data is being\nmore and more exploited, not just by marketers, but by recruiting companies\nand financial companies and risk management companies and people search sites so that people can search you. It's like not cool. Luckily, we all have rights to get ourselves off of these lists. The problem is no one's\ngonna spend the time going through the bureaucracy to actually get yourself off these hundreds of lists\nthat you are probably on. And that is where Incogni comes in. Incogni is the sponsor of today's video, as you probably have gathered, and I'm very grateful to\nthem for sponsoring the video and supporting our journalism. But also I'm grateful that they exist. Because I didn't know about them until they came to sponsor a video, and now I'm a super fan.

When I signed up for it, they were able to scan and see that I was on dozens of\nlists, over a hundred lists, and they were able to show\nme what lists I was on. It's all on this nice-looking dashboard. And then the best part is you get to sit back and watch Incogni do all the work for you, go and fight to get you\noff all of these lists. Sometimes that's as easy\nas just a little request that they do and they\nget you off the list. Sometimes they get\npushback from the company, and they will do that fight for you until you are off that list. And you just get to sit\nback and watch it happen. I'm really glad that they invented this because it has been getting out of hand. Like we love the internet, it's great, but like this data exploitation thing is getting out of hand.

Thank you, Incogni, for\nsponsoring the video. Let's dive into this big topic of pirates. Pirates aren't one thing. They've always existed. As long as there's been\ninternational trade on the ocean, there have been pirates, sailors who utilize the\nexpanse of the open ocean to rob and steal and run\nsophisticated businesses. If you haven't seen CGP\nGrey's deep dive on pirates, go watch it. It's a two-parter. Pirates are everything from Norse sailors who raided other ships on the high seas to the famous pirates of the Caribbean, like Britain's Blackbeard, who stole a French slave ship and souped it up into the\nultimate pirate vessel. Pirates were poor men who were looking for\nmoney and social mobility. Some of them were looking\nfor fame and glory and power in a time where seafaring men had little status or\nopportunity in society. We've romanticized them, we've caricatured them, and we idealize them as\nlegends and myths of the past. But piracy never fully went away. It still very much exists today. Here's a map of all the piracy incidents over the past 40 years, at least the reported ones. From Indonesian pirates\nhijacking cargo ships in the Strait of Malacca to Bangladeshi pirates\nholding fishermen hostage in exchange for ransoms, all the way to West Africa, where Nigerian pirates\nsteal oil off huge tankers and sell it on the black market. But most of the dots on\nthis map are right here, the gateway to the Suez Canal, one of the busiest\nhighways of global trade, off the coast of a country where piracy uniquely could thrive. The government of Somalia\ncollapsed in the early '90's, the country fractured, and instead of a central government, local clans started to control\npatches of the country. There was no real government to regulate this\n3,000-kilometer coastline, the longest coastline in Africa. As a result, huge fishing boats, mostly from Iran and Yemen, took advantage of this free-for-all, swooping in to these unregulated\nSomali waters to fish. These foreign fishers would steal hundreds of millions of\ndollars of seafood every year with nets that tear up the sea floor, destroying the ecosystem and depleting the fish\nstock in the process. This illegal fishing by foreign vessels started to outsize the catch of locals whose water this was. Local Somali fishermen\nwith their tiny boats couldn't compete, and soon this illegal foreign fishing eclipsed the catch of local Somalis. Around the same time, companies from Switzerland and Somali's former colonizer Italy were illegally paying corrupt factions of the Somali government to take their toxic waste, some of it even being radioactive. Tons of this waste ended up in both Somalia's land and water, which would go on to\nhave significant effects on the health of local communities. So it's the 1990s, and between the illegal\noverfishing and the waste dumping, Somali people's main livelihood is being pillaged by foreigners. And they don't really have a\ngovernment to help them out, to protect them. So some Somalis decided to fight back. - An American cargo ship\ntaken over by pirates. - Somali fishermen got together, and they formed an ocean militia. Some would call themselves\nthe Coast Guard, and they would use these tiny boats to chase down foreign fishing vessels and demand that they pay a fine. Some experts have called\nthis subsistence piracy because it was piracy, but it was also kind of fishermen\ndefending their livelihood from predatory foreigners. And at first it was rare. I mean, if you look at the data, you just see a handful of\nsuccessful incidents every year. Oh, and they were pretty basic too. Like in one of these early\nincidents of Somali piracy back in like 1994, you've got this wooden\nboat full of 26 Somali men claiming to be the Somali Coast Guard, and they go up to a shipping vessel and they get on board. They like hijack it for five days, but realize they can't really do anything so they just steal as much as\nthey can from the cargo ship and just go on their way. Yes, this was piracy, but it was super basic\nand kind of harmless. It was a bunch of locals\nfilling in on the power vacuum left by their non-existent government. And this is how it was for a long time. Loosely organized gangs\nof armed Somali men climbing aboard cargo\nships or fishing vessels, intimidating the crews to collect fines or sometimes asking for\ninformal license fees for fishing in their waters even though they didn't have any authority to give out licenses. They did it to get money, to basically be like, \"If you're gonna fish in our waters, \"you need to pay us.\" And the rest of the world\ndidn't really know about this. It like wasn't big enough\nnews for anyone to care. But that would soon change. - Across the region,\n80,000 people are dead. At least 22,000 of them were\nkilled here in Sri Lanka. - So there's kind of a turning point. Christmas 2004. This tsunami was devastating, mostly in Southeast Asia, but it also hit Somalia's\nreally delicate coast, destroying homes and boats and crippling an already\ndelicate economy and food supply. - [Reporter] The tsunami took the lives of some 150 people in Somalia and poisoned the precious\nlittle water supply that people had here. - And it also washed up\nsome of that toxic waste that had been dumped off their shores. This led to a UN investigation, which concluded that the waste was likely causing severe damage to the health of local people. And at this point, Somalia still isn't one country. There's some parts of the country that are peaceful and safe and under government control, but most of Somalia is still a patchwork of competing clans and warlords, a hotbed for terrorism and\norganized crime networks that controlled different\nparts of the country. (soldier chanting) And piracy, this thing that started off as an informal Coast Guard, was maturing in sophisticated ways. (ethereal electronic music) By 2005, you start to see\npirates using motherships, larger ships that allow them to go way further off their coast, and then to use speedboats to attack like they did to this cargo ship. This was a huge level-up\nfor Somali pirates. These motherships started\nto be equipped with radar, which allowed the pirates to have new ways of detecting their prey. You start to see them have GPS systems or satellite\nphones to communicate. Pirates start looking at shipping industry blogs and databases to locate and track shipping vessels. This was turning from\nbasic subsistence piracy to something more sophisticated. Pirates started to realize\njust how much money and value was flowing through this corridor headed towards the Suez Canal, like one of the busiest\nhighways of international trade in the world. And with these new and improved tactics came more profitable business models that would change everything for pirates. - [Reporter] Police in\nFinland say the owner of the missing freighter Arctic Sea has received a demand for a ransom. - It was the early 2000's, and it was the beginning\nof the era of ransoms. - You were kidnapped by Somali pirates and you were held hostage\nfor more than two years. - [Johnny] Hey, Michael,\nit's Johnny Harris. - [Michael] Hi, Johnny,\ngood to hear from you. - So we had a really\ninteresting conversation with this American journalist named Michael Scott Moore. He was kidnapped by Somali pirates and held for almost three years before being released for\na $1.6 million ransom. - [Michael] And people say, \"Oh, but they're just\nfrustrated fishermen.\" They're not. They were in the '90's, but it was a much bigger deal than just fishermen turning to piracy. - Ransoms changed everything. Pirates were realizing how easy it was to hold a ship hostage and to demand a multimillion dollar ransom to extract a huge profit, which attracted the attention of warlords, who saw a business opportunity. Warlords now wanted to fund hijackings like this one where pirates were hijacking\na Ukrainian coal ship that was traveling from\nSouth Africa to Turkey. They could hold it hostage and release it only in exchange for $700,000, which is what they got. Or another instance where\npirates riding on speedboats captured this Japanese ship and its 20-person crew, holding them hostage until somebody coughed up $2 million. There was investment in\nthese pirate operations because there was a return to be had. And by 2007, around 30% of\nthe world's pirate attacks occurred within this circle. But wait, let's keep this in perspective. This actually wasn't particularly high. If you look at a graph of all of the other regions of the world, you'll see that this wasn't\nby any means an outlier. But watch what happens the next year. This line going up represents the expansion of\nthe piracy industry in Somalia. There was way too much\nmoney to be made here, and warlords were\ngetting better and better at investing in and\nrunning pirate businesses. By 2009, this body of water off of Somalia was home to nearly half of\nall piracy incidents on Earth. And look at this graph of\nthe average ransoms paid. In 2008, the average ransom\nwas a million dollars. A total of $30 million\nwas paid out that year. And you gotta keep this in perspective, these were huge sums of money for anyone, but especially poor\nfishermen turned pirates in a country with a GDP per\nperson of $517 per year. But even still, this was just the beginning. - If you'd simply refuse to pay, I mean, the pirates\nhave a lot of hostages. The consequences of those\nbeing shot, for instance, would be unimaginable. - All of this influx of ransom cash kicked off a pirate economy cycle where pirates would attack a ship, hold the crew hostage, and get paid a high ransom. They would bring this back\nto the clan leader warlord who funded them, which would make that person rich and allow them to invest in bigger boats and more guns and\nrecruiting more young men and appeasing the local\ncoastal communities who would support them, which they would use to hijack more ships in more sophisticated ways. And it repeated and repeated, getting more and more sophisticated\nand dangerous each time. - [Michael] So a businessman\nwho gets to be so rich that he needs to protect his\nbusiness interests with gunmen, that's a warlord. And a pirate boss is nothing else. He's a businessman who invests in piracy. - The pirate businesses\nhad lawyers and cooks and bank-note tellers with machines that could detect fake bills so that they could know\nif their ransom cash was real or not. There was this great reporting at the time in 2009 by Reuters. One of their journalists\nwent to a pirate town that had been a sleepy fishing village but had turned into a booming pirate hub, or in their words, pirate lair. What Reuters found was that\nthis economy was so booming that they had created a stock exchange where any local in the town\ncould invest what they had into a piracy business. There were dozens of\nthese piracy businesses, and you can invest in the one that you think is gonna\ngo get a successful ransom by hijacking an international\nshipping vessel. And people made a lot of money. One local said they made\n$75,000 in just a couple months because they had made a good\nbet on the right pirates. - [Michael] Pirate bosses\nwere not just top pirates, they were investors who had\na portfolio of businesses. - These pirate businesses would in turn support these communities, help fund the schools and the hospitals in order to curry favor with the locals to make sure that they would support them running their businesses. But the people who were\nreally getting rich here were mostly the clan leaders, the warlords who were building massive\nvillas and buying luxury cars and throwing lavish, drug-laden parties. This was no longer the DIY Coast Guard. This was now lucrative organized crime. And yet some of these pirate groups still tried to make a moral case as to why they were\njustified in doing this, saying that this wasn't piracy, this was retaliation for all of the exploitation\nof Somali waters by foreign countries. You see this in a 2008\nhijacking of a Ukrainian vessel, when these pirates demand $8 million, claiming that they would use the money to clean up the toxic waste that European companies\nhad dumped in their waters. Yes, European companies have\ndumped toxic waste in Somalia. Were these pirates actually\ngoing to use the $8 million to clean that up? Probably not. At least that's what we\nfound in our reporting. A lot of the moralistic,\nlike Robin Hood narrative became really thin once\nwarlords got involved and once they demanded a\nreturn for their investment. And you just start to see how\nthin this moral argument is when pirates start boarding ships and just shooting crew at random to show how serious they were and to increase the likelihood of getting a high ransom payout. - Unfortunately, there is\none seaman from mainland who was killed by by the Somali pirates. - [Johnny] Or when they\nstarted hijacking UN ships that were full of food and medical aid meant for Somali people. - The ship apparently was\nbound for Mombasa, Kenya, and the shipment included\nvegetable oil, corn, soy blend, and other basic food commodities bound for people in countries including Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya. - This was about money and power, and it was able to thrive because of a country that\ndidn't have a government that actually controlled the country. By 2011, there were 237\npiracy incidents here. Over 1,200 hostages were taken that year. 35 of them died while in captivity. This was becoming more and more deadly and more and more lucrative. Let's go back to that graph of the average ransoms that were paid. You can see it grow up\nto around $5 million for the average ransom. The total number of ransoms paid in 2011? $150 million. It was getting out of hand, but it would take a few key events for the world to really take notice. - [Captain] Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, all ships stay inside,\nstay inside, stay inside. We are trying to run away from them. Now, stay inside everybody. This is a real alarm. Please stay inside. - There's this funny thing\nin international news where in order for the world\nto take notice of something, it sort of has to affect like Westerners. And that's no different with pirates. There was this one incident\nin the fall of 2005 where a group of pirates showed\nup to a luxury cruise ship. It was full of Western tourists. - They hit us with rocket grenades, RPGs. There was a woman in her cabin, and she was fortunately in her bathroom, but a rocket grenade went right through and blew the whole cabin up. - The cruise ship escaped, but it still led to global news coverage. Another incident was in 2008 when a Ukrainian ship was\nhijacked by these pirates. Little did these pirates know they had just stumbled upon a shipment of tanks and grenades and\nammunition bound for Sudan. They were demanding $35\nmillion to give it back, holding the crew and the ship hostage. The U.S. and Russia both freaked out here, and they sent in their navys to like monitor the situation to make sure the pirates weren't gonna take the\nweapons off the boat. In the end, the pirates agreed to\na $3.2 million payout, and the secret weapons\nshipment continued onward. It was a big scare, and it was another step\nin waking the world up to how big of a deal this was becoming. But the biggest event\nhappened a few months later. A U.S. container ship was\ntraveling from Oman to Kenya when four pirates boarded\nand hijacked the ship, holding the crew hostage\nand demanding $2 million. The U.S. government has a firm policy that it doesn't negotiate with hostages, but what they do do is\nsend in their military. So after four days, the Navy Seals arrived with snipers. They shot three of the four\npirates and rescued the crew. It was an incident that was later depicted in this Tom Hanks movie. These were dramatic events, a hostage situation with\nsnipers and Navy Seals, and it spread into the\ninternational news cycle in a way that Somali\npiracy just hadn't before. - [Reporter] Captain\nPhillips was taken hostage for almost five days and then rescued by the U.S. Navy. - It was clear that this had become too lucrative of an economy. There was too much incentive for warlords to get in on all of this\nmoney for it to stop. The only way to slow this down\nwas a serious intervention. As we were reporting this story, I kept asking like, \"Why is this such a\ndifficult problem to solve?\" And we asked all of the\nexperts we interviewed, and we have a pretty good idea now why this is way more\ncomplicated than expected. First off, guns. You can't really carry guns on international shipping vessels, partly because there's\ninternational gun laws that are complicated, partly because shipping companies\ndon't want guns on boats because it can be a weird liability thing. You can't just have like a\ngun in a safe box somewhere. Second, it's hard to send in the navys to patrol these waters because pirates often\ndon't look like pirates until it's too late, at which point they're prone to use their victims as human shields against any threatening navy. So unless you've got like the\nbest snipers in the world, like the Navy Seals, it's actually really hard to use just like military force\nagainst these pirates. And lastly, you have to remember\nwhat we're talking about. We're talking about the open ocean, huge swaths of water. It's really challenging to monitor and control\nthis in an effective way. It's one reason why piracy has always thrived on the open sea. But even despite all these challenges, governments and businesses\nput their heads together and they figured something out. The first one's kind of boring. It's this report that this international\nshipping organization put out that basically teaches ships\nand captains and companies how to protect themselves. They recommend them using\nthis high-pressure hose that allows 'em to just like\nspray water at the pirates. They started recommending putting barbed wire and\nrazor wire around your ship. Kind of gnarly. Put locks on your doors, increase your surveillance. Like this is pretty basic stuff. Create a safe room or a citadel where you can like lock\nyourself in if you get hijacked. But one of the big things they did was create this\ninternationally-recognized corridor where ships could all travel\ntogether like in a caravan, sometimes escorted by a navy ship from one of these countries, helping them navigate this really busy but very vulnerable part of the international shipping highway. And another huge step was, in spite of all the complicated gun laws, vessels were now allowed\nto employ armed guards to stand watch as they\nnavigate these waters. So now you've got like security guards with guns on the ship who have nothing else to do but like protect the boat. And guess what? All of these strategies totally worked. I mean, look at this graph. After its all-time high in 2011, hijacking incidents plummeted because of these interventions. But this leaves us with kind of a complicated\nresolution here. These communities were left\nbehind by their government. They don't have the\ninfrastructure of a society where people can thrive and work. That's for a lot of reasons, but it's in part because of the pillaging and the exploitation from outsiders. And so while these warlords who committed horrific crimes to get rich deserve no moral justification, it is morally complicated when you look at people who\nare just trying to live, whose waters have been\npoisoned by toxic waste, whose country has been pillaged, and who turned to piracy as a last resort. But I'm not gonna go into\nthe ethical dilemma here. I think you all can fight that out in the comments if you want. I'd love to see what you have to say. The fact is piracy was\nsolved in the Horn of Africa because of these interventions, at least for the most part. But just as Somali piracy was declining, incidents of piracy started popping up on the other side of the continent. The Gulf of Guinea took Somalia's title as the piracy hotspot of the world. These attacks happen\nfor different reasons, and they look quite different. They're usually Nigerian pirates boarding oil tankers to steal the oil that they feel like was stolen from their land. The international community\nis now turning its focus here, and this is a more\ncomplicated thing to solve for a lot more reasons. The fact is piracy won't go away as long as the ingredients that\nhave always fueled it exist. Frustrated young men with\nno chance of finding work in an economy, incentivized and organized by clan leaders looking to get rich on the high seas, operating in a gray area where the government and the society that should support them and employ them doesn't exist or is too weak to help, leaving them to fend for themselves and to turn to more and more\nsophisticated forms of crime in the process. (plaintive electronic music) (plaintive electronic music) Hey, everyone, look at this map behind me. I don't know if you caught\nit during the video, but this is a map mostly of East Asia, but you get this Somali\nPeninsula and the Gulf of Aden. And basically everything\nwe've talked about, it's all right here. It's really a beautiful map. And when you look at it, you can see just how\nimportant this Suez Canal is to global shipping. Anyway. I've wanted to look into\nSomali pirates forever. I always saw the news over the years and never really understood\nthe story, the background. And we reported on this, and we talked to a lot of experts, and there's actually a\nlot of politics in this. There's a lot of people who argue for like a vindication\nmorally of Somali pirates, saying that they're just retaliating against a world who's exploited them. And like there's a strong argument there. But I don't know. Again, I'm really curious to hear what people have to say about it. Yeah, we are interested in making deeper and deeper videos. A video like this takes\nmuch more time and resources to like really understand, to get the data. Like we've got this whole\ndataset that we used to map every incident. Like that's just like a way bigger thing. But we want to do more of these. So I'm curious to hear from you what stories we should do next. For those who want to support this effort of making high-quality, factual videos, we have a Patreon. It is called The Newsroom. That is what we call it. And it is a place where you\ncan support with your money to help make possible what we do here. You can also buy LUTs and presets, which are the things that\nwe use to color our videos to make our videos look\nbeautiful like this and not like this, which is what it looks\nlike when we shoot it. I have a map poster that we sold out of, but then I'm pretty sure we reprinted it like a thousand more. So that should be in stock. Don't quote me on that. It could be sold out again by\nthe time you're watching this. I have no idea. Yeah, go watch Search Party, which is our new channel that is created by my old Vox colleague and now my partner, Sam Ellis, who is building that channel, but sort of under our\nbroader company here. And it's awesome and it\nis rigorous and amazing and really good journalism. It's called Search Party. It is here on YouTube. And I think that's all the\nthings I need to tell you about here in my little cozy couch setting. It's so dim in here. I feel like I could just\ntake a nap on this couch. And I just might. So thank you all for being here and for the support and the kind comments and the appreciation. And we'll see you soon in the next one. Bye-bye. (ethereal electronic music)"

Kim Jong-un hasn't left the country in three years, but he just decided to do so. To go to Russia. To visit President Vladimir Putin. He snaked up the coast of North Korea past this really bizarre place where China, Russia and North Korea borders all come together and eventually made it to Eastern Russia. By the way, this train only goes like 30 or 40 miles an hour max speed because they want it to be extra safe. Kim is reportedly joined by his munitions and weapons guy leading many experts to speculate that this trip is about Russia asking North Korea for weapons. Reminder that Vladimir Putin is very isolated from the world right now and is struggling to get the weapons and materials he needs to continue his war in Ukraine. So he's turning to a fellow outcast, North Korea, for help. So now we just wait and see if North Korean weapons start flowing into Russia.

    "video_id": "LP3T_VAkY9o",
    "captions": "(dramatic music) (keyboard clicking) - [Johnny] In the summer of 2002, the Director of the British\nIntelligence Agency, MI6, Richard Dearlove,\ntraveled to Washington DC to meet with the Director\nof the CIA, George Tenet. The topic of the meeting was Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein. In the meeting, the CIA director shared\nclassified information with his British counterpart, who then traveled back to\nLondon to 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime\nMinister, Tony Blair. Dearlove told his Prime\nMinister everything about what was really happening behind the scenes in the United States, how the US was planning to\ninvade Iraq no matter what. It was a highly classified meeting but notes were taken and\nclassified and put into a memo. That memo was later leaked to British author and\njournalist, Michael Smith, who published it in 2005 and that's what we're looking at, a secret meeting and the memo it produced, meant only for the eyes\nof top British officials. It was an explosive leak. What we see is that Dearlove\ntells his Prime Minister everything he heard in\nWashington a few days earlier, and that this was a very different story than the one the Bush administration was telling to the public, that an American invasion was inevitable, that Bush's people were fixated on removing Saddam Hussein\nfrom power, no matter what, and that the US government was blatantly cooking up intel and facts to help sell their invasion. This document shows us how\npower really works in our world, how a small group of people\ndecided to topple a dictator, to occupy a country, and then invented a story\nto support their plan. It was a false story, but it helped them sell a horrifying war. It's a story that is revealed in detail by the Downing Street memo. (dramatic music continues) - States like these\nconstitute an axis of evil. One last chance to avoid war. And the entire world will know that we will take whatever\nactions necessary. - Hey, we are interrupting the programming for a commercial break, that's how we're able to make videos and do all of this\nbecause we have sponsors. If you're a longtime viewer of the channel you will know that I am\na giant fan of therapy, professional therapy with\na professional therapist. I went because I felt like I wanted to understand my mind better, I wanted to understand\nsome of my demons better. Been doing it for three years and it has reshaped the\nway that I see the world. The sponsor of today's\nvideo is BetterHelp, who is a company that is trying to make therapy more accessible using technology. Usually, when you try to find a therapist, you call around, at least\nhere in the United States, to like see if your insurance works and if there's availability and you go sit in an office. With BetterHelp, you sign up and you\nfill out a questionnaire and then BetterHelp\nmatches you with somebody in their massive network\nof licensed therapists. There's like tens of thousands\nof people in this network and they will match you with somebody. And unlike the traditional way, you can be communicating with a therapist in as little as like 48 hours, which is mind blowing for those of us who have gone the traditional way before. If you don't like your therapist, you can switch for free and choose somebody else\nin their massive network. If you're not interested\nin like a video call, you can just do it over text, if that's how you prefer to communicate. The point is that learning\nto trust and communicate with a professional can have\nhuge benefits on your life, and BetterHelp tries to make\nit a more frictionless process for you to get connected\nwith a good therapist and start changing your life with therapy. We live in a time where therapy\nis more and more normalized and I love that and I love that BetterHelp is working hard to get\npeople into therapy. There's a link in my description, it's betterhelp.com/JohnnyHarris when you click the link it\nhelps support the channel, but it also gets you in on\n10% off your first month so you can try it out at a discount and see if it's a good fit for you. For me, therapy took a few\nmonths to develop that trust and develop an understanding of how it was working in my life. So you can try it out and see if it has that\nsame effect for you. And again, you can cancel any time if you feel like it\nisn't a good fit for you. Thank you, BetterHelp, for\nsponsoring today's video. And with that, let's get back into it with the Downing Street memo. - On September the\n11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war\nagainst our country. The United States\nmilitary has begun strikes against Al-Qaeda terrorist\ntraining camps in Afghanistan. - [Johnny] Let's start by looking at another document from the fall of 2001. When Deputy Secretary of\nDefense Paul Wolfowitz created this memo for his\nboss, Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense. This was just 10 weeks after the attacks that changed the course of history but this document wasn't about that. It was about Iraq, a country that had\nnothing to do with 9/11. Rumsfeld reviewed the document before meeting with an army general. He marked it up with his notes, giving us insight into what the Secretary of\nDefense of the United States was really thinking about after 9/11, how this group of military\nleaders were set on, quote, \"building momentum to\ntopple Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, to\ndecapitate the government,\" a government that was no\nlonger useful to them. Saddam Hussein had been a useful client to the United States,\nespecially in the '80s when he was waging a war against Iran, an enemy of the United States. But those days were now over. Saddam had turned into just\na troublemaker in the region, creating instability that could threaten the\nUS' easy access to oil. - Two hours ago, allied\nair forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait. This conflict started August 2nd when the dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor. - [Johnny] And in many\nways, Iraq was an old mess in need of cleaning up, a mess that Bush Senior\nhad failed to resolve during the first Gulf War. Iraq was supposed to disarm\nitself after that war but had kicked out the UN\nweapons inspector teams. But that wasn't the main\nreason why, right after 9/11, these guys were talking\nabout invading Iraq. A bigger reason is that these leaders wanted to remind the world\nwho the global superpower was. They needed to after\nbeing brutally attacked on their own soil. A non-US friendly regime, like Iraq, couldn't be allowed to\nstand in a post 9/11 world, or in the words of Rumsfeld himself, hours after the towers fell, quote, \"We need to bomb something else to show that we're big and strong and not gonna be pushed around.\" Iraq and its leader was\nthat something else. And now, Bush and his advisors\nwere looking at a plan to make it a reality. But how to start the war? Could they tie Saddam Hussein to something that Americans feared,\nlike 9/11 or anthrax? Or could they tell a story about weapons of mass destruction? What other countries could they bring in to support their invasion? And of course, the most\nimportant consideration, Rumsfield jots it here at the end, they would need an influence campaign, they would need to sell the war. And when should they begin? How about right away? - Iraq continues to flaunt his hostility toward America and to support terror. - [Johnny] Three months later, the President was telling the world that Iraq was one of a\ngroup of evil countries that the US must oppose in the global fight against good and evil. - States like these\nconstitute an axis of evil. The price of indifference\nwould be catastrophic. - [Johnny] By the summer of 2002, this idea that Bush's advisors\nhad scratched down after 9/11 was developing into an official policy. That handwritten influence campaign to sell the war was now in full swing. - There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. The Iraqi regime has been free to pursue the development of\nweapons of mass destruction. - We know they have weapons\nof mass destruction, there isn't any debate about it. - [Johnny] And this is\nexactly what the head of MI6 told Prime Minister\nTony Blair at his house in the summer of 2002 after meeting with the CIA in Washington. It's what we see in\nthe Downing Street memo that there was a perceptible\nshift in attitude in Washington and that the US invasion of\nIraq was now seen as inevitable and that they were now fixing intelligence around a decision that\nthey had already made, and that the US wasn't really\nplanning to work with the UN. They didn't want weapons inspections or getting UN approval for military force. And crucially, the Head of the\nMI6 tells the Prime Minister that these Bush people\naren't really thinking much about the aftermath of such an invasion. - What is inevitable is not regime change, it is disarmament of\nweapons of mass destruction. - [Johnny] This memo\nwasn't supposed to be seen by anyone but just a few, and that's why we can learn from it. It serves as one of the most\npotent pieces of evidence that the Bush administration was maneuvering two\nvery different stories. Their private story about the need to remove a dictator to project US power, which was in stark contrast\nto the public story that they had to tell\nto sell the invasion, their influence campaign. - Any country on the face of the earth with an active intelligence program knows that Iraq has weapons\nof mass destruction. - [Johnny] Because they knew that if they were really gonna sell this war, they would need to convince\nnot only the American public but also Congress and at least partially, the international community. What we learned in the Downing Street memo is that they had settled on two main focus points for their story, that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and that they're also working\nwith the masterminds of 9/11. Not long after this meeting\nbetween MI6 and the CIA, Bush and his allies ramp\nup their influence campaign to sell their war. - We've learned that Iraq\nhas trained Al-Qaeda members in bomb making, poisons and deadly gases. - [Johnny] The sales pitches\nto the American people for an invasion of Iraq were\nmade with absolute certainty. Certainty that Iraq had WMDs. - He had agreed, and the UN had agreed, that he would not have a WMD program. We know he does have one. - [Johnny] Certainty that\nthey wanted to use them against Americans and American allies. - Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has\nweapons of mass destruction, that he is amassing them\nto use against our friends, against our allies, and against us. - [Johnny] Certainty that\nIraq was harboring terrorists. - An Al-Qaeda terrorist\nescaped from Afghanistan and are known to be in Iraq. - [Johnny] And certainty that Iraq was working on obtaining nuclear weapons. - And Iraq's state-controlled media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Hussein and\nhis nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about\nhis continued appetite for these weapons. - [Johnny] And these\nspeeches were working. By the fall of 2002,\nAmericans were in favor of an invasion of Iraq by\njust a narrow majority. But there was just one problem, that all of these statements were lies. Indeed, this was already known in the secret rooms of Downing Street that the US was fixing\ntheir facts and their intel to match their already made decision. Iraq's supposed links to Al-Qaeda were based on one interrogation of a guy whose testimony lacked,\nquote, \"specific details\" and who was intentionally lying about it to mislead his interrogators. Bush and his allies knew this, it was clearly documented\nback in February of 2002, and yet publicly, the\nscary story about Al-Qaeda being in Iraq continued to be\nsold by Bush and his people. - The Iraqi regime has\nplotted to develop anthrax, nerve gas, and nuclear\nweapons for over a decade. - [Johnny] The case for weapons\nof mass destruction in Iraq was equally thin and\nsenior officials knew it. Like in September, 2002, when Donald Rumsfeld received this report from the Joint Chiefs assessing what real evidence there\nactually was for WMD in Iraq. The report is shockingly honest and it says that the conclusion\nthat Saddam has WMD, quote, \"Relied heavily on analytic\nassumptions and judgments rather than hard evidence.\" That's word salad for it was\nspeculation and conjecture. The report goes on to say that they didn't have anything solid on nuclear weapons-related facilities, and concludes that they\ndon't know of any facilities where Saddam may be producing\nor testing biological weapons. And so, we know now that\nthey had almost no evidence for their story about why\nthe US should invade Iraq. And yet even knowing this, they kept selling the same story, convincing the American people. - There's no doubt in my mind he wants to have a nuclear weapon and he's got some capacity. - Wherever threats are\nforming against our country, we will respond. - [Johnny] But they couldn't\ngo on like this forever. They knew that if they were\nreally gonna sell this war, they were going to need to\nshow real convincing evidence, not to the people, but to Congress. And this is where we get another instance of\nfixing the intelligence to fit the policy. It came in September, 2002, when President Bush asked Congress to give him the authority to invade Iraq. In response, senate leaders requested an immediate National\nIntelligence Estimate, which is a report from the\nentire intelligence community meant to help Congress\nmake informed decisions. This could be really bad\nfor Bush and his allies. So he and the CIA get hard at work pulling together a report\nthat fits their story, intelligence to back up all their public statements and speeches. They come out with this\nhighly redacted report that they deliver in October of 2002. The report makes some very strong claims. They claim that Iraq has\nbeen building more WMD, that they have chemical\nand biological weapons, and that they will have a nuclear\nweapon during this decade. And to congressional leaders,\nthis appeared rock solid. Here was the entire intelligence community coming together saying that\nIraq had horrific weapons and that they wanted to get more. - Saddam Hussein has composed\na scarlet chapter of terror. Our only responsible option is to confront this threat\nbefore Americans die. - There is no such thing as\na Democrat or Republican war. - [Johnny] So in that same month, based on this report and all\nof these public speeches, Congress gives the green light for war. (heart beating loudly) But this National Intelligence\nEstimate was deeply flawed. It was a perfect example\nof the fixed intelligence described in the Downing Street memo. It was put together in less\nthan a month, totally rushed. The report had been plagued by groupthink and directed by political pressure with the Bush administration\npushing analysts to deliver a report that\nmatched their conclusions that they had already\ncome to months earlier. And they did this using\nvery old intelligence. The CIA hadn't had any human\nassets on the ground for years, so their report wasn't even based off of anything after 1998. But it didn't matter, Bush and his allies had\nsuccessfully sold the war to Congress and the American people. But there was one last hurdle. It was the international community, which would mean they would\nhave to face the UN process that they apparently had no patience for. - Iraq has answered a decade of UN demands with a decade of defiance. - [Johnny] So it's November, 2002, and in response to the rising tensions between Iraq and the US, the UN Security Council\npasses this Resolution 1441. It was a measure that\nwas meant to give Iraq a final opportunity to comply\nwith weapons inspections to show the world that\nthey had fully disarmed and had no weapons of mass destruction. Bush and his allies saw\nthis as an opportunity, if they could somehow show that Iraq wasn't complying with\nthis new inspection process, this resolution implied\nthat they would be justified in invading the country, their\nlong desired war would be on. But they had a problem, which is that Iraq and Saddam Hussein were complying with the\nweapons inspections. Over the course of four months, UN weapons inspectors searched\nIraq from top to bottom. They were led by Hans Blix, the former Head of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. They conducted over 900\ninspections at over 500 locations and they didn't find anything, no WMD, no biological weapons,\nno nuclear weapons programs. - Iraq has, on the whole,\ncooperated rather well. Access has been provided to all sites we have wanted to inspect, universities, military bases, presidential sites,\nand private residences. - [Johnny] Hans Blix did find two things that were important. First, they did find\nsome ballistic missiles that the UN says have an effective range that makes them illegal, so they would need to\nbe destroyed by Iraq. And second, there were\nsome chemical weapons that the Iraqi regime said\ncannot be accounted for. But Blix insists that\nthis does not mean that they have these weapons, it just means that they need more time to work out the accounting situation. But this error was exactly\nwhat the Bush circle needed to justify their invasion. - [Announcer] I call now on the distinguished Secretary of State of the United States of America. - [Johnny] They sent their most respected cabinet member to the UN, Secretary of State, Colin Powell. He came equipped with\nphotos of what he says are mobile weapons facilities. - Saddam Hussein and his regime\nare concealing their efforts to produce more weapons\nof mass destruction. - [Johnny] He plays\ntapes that he says prove that the Iraqis are hiding their weapons. - [Colin] We evacuated\neverything to make sure it was not around when\nthe inspectors showed up. - [Johnny] And then he says\nthat this is solid evidence that shows that Iraq is\nviolating the UN resolution that told them to disarm. This whole thing contradicts\nwhat the UN weapons inspectors had found in their hundreds\nand hundreds of inspections. They bulldozed the process, and say they have justification to invade. - My colleagues, we have an obligation to see that our resolutions\nare complied with. - They've got the\nAmerican public on board, they've got Congress on board, and now the UK is in lockstep. - This is the time for this house to show that we will stand up\nfor what we know to be right, to show that we will confront the tyrannies and\ndictatorships and terrorists who put our way of life at risk. - [Johnny] The Bush administration\nabandons the UN process, and that March, his people do what they set out to do 18 months earlier, when they were looking\nfor something else to bomb to show who's really in\ncharge on the world stage. - My fellow citizens, American and coalition forces\nare in the early stages of military operations to\ndisarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger. America faces an enemy that has no regard for conventions of war\nor rules of morality. (tense music) (explosion booming) - [Johnny] Bush's war took the life of an estimated half million Iraqis, and thousands more who\nfought for their country. And over the course of\na decade occupying Iraq, no weapons were found,\nno nuclear facilities, no mobile weapons labs. In fact, it seemed like Iraq had dismantled its nuclear\nprogram back in 1991, and the rest of its chemical\nand biological weapons just a few years later. After the invasion, the US never allowed the UN\ninspectors back into the country to help with their search. The US would never find a way to link the Iraqi regime\nto Al-Qaeda or to anthrax. Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, who played a major role\nin selling this war to the international\ncommunity would later say that he regrets his part in starting the war. - I deeply regret that some\nof the information I presented which was multi-source was wrong. - [Johnny] Hans Blix, the Chief Weapons Inspector for the UN, would comment later that year that, \"It is sort of fascinating that you can have 100% certainty about weapons of mass destruction and zero certainty about where they are.\" We may never know what was in the heart and minds of these senior leaders, whether they truly\nbelieved their own lies, whether they felt justified\nin the choices they made. But what we can learn from this story is how these leaders behaved when they thought no one was watching, when they thought they could tell a compelling story to the public while having a totally\ndifferent set of motivations. And how, with enough fear\nand enough deception, you can lead an entire society\ninto an unprovoked war, changing the course of\nhistory in the process. - Our economy is in recession and the civilized world\nfaces unprecedented dangers, yet the state of our union\nhas never been stronger.

    "captions": "is Joe Rogan actually a conspiracy theorist he talks about it all the time he used to be a huge moonlanding conspiracy believer and if you dig enough on YouTube you will find Joe Rogan's personal YouTube account which is basically just moonlanding conspiracy documentaries that he uploaded as proof like 15 years ago he's kind of backed up on a lot of those conspiracy views but he does like to have conspiracy theorists on his show so anyway we've just published this huge video all about Joe Rogan but we're also working on one about the moonlanding conspiracy it's kind of the crossover episode that nobody asked for"

    "captions": "Joe Rogan isn't who you thought he was I assumed that he was this kind of like far right kind of alt-right dude based on simply what I had heard about him especially after he said people say like oh you know you're a secret conservative like you could suck my and I'm a bleeding heart liberal when it comes to a lot of [\u00a0__\u00a0] there it is I just also believe in discipline and hard work turns out that Joe Rogan has some mostly Progressive views on Health Care on universal basic income which is like giving money to people for free abortion gay marriage and most notably recreational weed but what's confusing about Joe Rogan is that he doesn't fit into the full box of a good liberal he has people on his show that like are kind of radioactive in our culture and this is one reason why he's so popular in a world of black and white polarized narratives Joe Rogan kind of breaks that for better and worse there's a lot to critique about Joe Rogan but there's also some stuff to admire as well I did it all in this deep dive video we made over on YouTube"

    "captions": "(overlapping voice clips) - Oh my goodness. - Anything we need to know?\nAs soon as I find out, you'll know. - One, two, three, four, five,\nsix, seven, eight, nine, 10. Okay. Sorry. Here we go. I've wondered for a very\nlong time how Joe Rogan, this guy who describes himself as- - A professional fool. - Went from hosting a game\nshow where he eats cockroaches with contestants to\nbecoming the host of perhaps the most popular podcast on Earth. - (makes noises) And you're going, no. And that's how you die. - Now listen, I am not\na Joe Rogan listener. Well, at least I wasn't before this story, but by now I am because by now\nme and my team have listened to a lot of Joe Rogan. - If you didn't know whether\nor not people agree with you or disagree with you, I think that'd probably be\nbetter overall for people. - I wanted to understand\nwhere this guy came from, what his deal is. What does he say during these\nlike two to three hour long episodes that are listened\nto by millions of people? Because for better or worse, he is influencing a lot of people. So let me show you how an\naverage Joe like Rogan can sit around getting high,\ntalking to his friends and somehow get millions\nof people to tune in. Now, I know that talking\nabout Joe Rogan can cause some controversy. - [Speaker 1] But at\nthe end of that round, he was in deep (bleeps). - Before we get into it,\nlet's thank today's sponsor.

Thank you Nord VPN for\nsponsoring today's video. Let's get back to Joe Rogan. Okay, so it's 1987 and here's\na 20 year old Joe Rogan, taking a guy down with\na spinning back kick at a TaeKwonDo competition. - Always moving to new schools, always dealing with new kids. And I wasn't big and I\ndidn't know how to fight and I got picked on and I didn't like it. So I said I want to, I want\nto figure out how to fight. - And eventually he got really good at it. - I was competing from the time I was 15. I just threw myself into it.\nIt's all I did every day. - And then one summer night\nin 1988, when he was 21, he went to an open mic night\nat a comedy club in Boston. - Your legs are sprawled\nout on the bed like Bambi trying to walk at a frozen lake and banging your head against\nthe headboard. (hits floor) I love it when we make love. - His friends goaded\nhim to get up on stage and perform a standup set. It must have gone really\nwell because soon after, Rogan moves to LA to\nmake it big in comedy. By the nineties, he was\nshowing up in TV shows as the goofy, lovable comedic relief. - 'Cause the light's better over here, everything's better over here. - But this sitcomy thing wasn't his dream. He loved comedy and fighting. Enter UFC. Ultimate Fighting Championship. (overlapping voice clips) - Oh! - Okay, so it's the late nineties and now Joe Rogan is like a UFC commentator\npersonality interviewing fighters backstage. This is actual footage\nof his first appearance. - They are anticipating\na wipe out in the finals. - [Johnny] And I mean this guy's good. Like he's got such a magnetic\npersonality even back then. By the time he was in his\nthirties, it was the 2000s. And Joe had proven to be a\ntalented host and entertainer and he was chosen to host a\nshow where contestants would be pushed to their limits to test their fear. It was a show aptly named Fear Factor. Fear Factor. I mean, I remember\nthis from my childhood. The show had like a huge\nimpact on our media culture. - Hold on, hold on, hold on.\n- (screams) - [Johnny] I think it kind\nof laid the foundation for sensational reality TV. It was disgusting and sometimes\njust downright horrifying. But honestly it was brilliant\nbecause it was impossible to look away. - Sherry, relax, relax, Sherry. Sherry, relax. - So Fear Factor was like the\nbig leveling up for Joe Rogan. - You know what, again, very\nfortunate, it was a great gig. Plenty of money and it was all good. And it definitely helped my\nstandup 'cause it gave me (bleeps) you money too, it gave\nme the ability to not worry about like having money in the bank. - And by the end of the early 2000s, Joe had a lot of experience. He was an entertainer, he was a comedian, he was a host, he was an actor. He had built a hefty network\nof interesting people. It was charismatic and tough\nand funny and hardworking. All of the ingredients he\nneeded for his next move. Podcasting. On Christmas Eve 2009, Joe and\none of his comedian friends recorded a two hour podcast. It was a sprawling conversation\ncovering everything from conspiracy theories to game addiction, to sensory deprivation tanks. It was honestly a good omen for\nwhat this show would become. He called his podcast\nThe Joe Rogan Experience, kind of a nod to Jimi Hendrix. Now remember in 2009, podcasts\nweren't really a thing yet. You had a bunch of like,\nsort of radio shows that were making it onto\npodcasts like This American Life or Planet Money, Stuff You Should Know. But this was all very new at the time. But that changed when people\ncould stream podcasts on demand with their new little internet\nconnected pocket computers/ Right from the beginning,\nJoe Rogan's show was fast, prolific, and consistent,\nuploading multiple times a week. And by the end of his\nsecond year on the show, he had had a bunch of big names as guests. - We've done everything wrong. We, these were young male elephants. They're fa-, they're the\nfastest moving creatures I think in the wild once they get going. And they hate bright, like bright shirts, which of course we were wearing. They don't, they're spooked\nby people holding implements, which of course that's what we were doing. And they particularly don't\nlike being herded by people one, you know, thousandth of their weight. (all laugh) - At the beginning there were\nmostly comedians and fighters. - I'm thinking about Tom\nCruise and Scientology. There is a man using every ounce of what Scientology's offering\nto make himself the best available man that he's capable of being. Then you've got Travolta. - But soon he started to\nbranch outside of comedians and fighters to a\ndifferent genre of people. Let's call them thinkers. - Workers don't have the\nright to engage in collective bargaining in the United\nStates until the 1930s. - That's where that whole idea\nof the let the market decide falls apart. - He would have philosophers\non and politicians, scientists, you name it. The show started to become\njust a grab bag of any interesting person Joe\nRogan wanted to have a conversation with. Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist, appeared a few times. - You get a multiverse. We didn't pull that out of our ass, that came out of the equations. - Soon it was bigger and bigger names. Elon Musk, Russell Brand,\nNick Kroll, Jay Leno, Jordan Peterson, Wiz Khalifa,\nDr. Phil, Travis Barker. By the late 2010s, the Joe\nRogan Experience was reaching around 11 million listeners per episode, making it the most popular podcast ever at least on platforms like\nApple Podcasts and Spotify. Like I had never listened to this, but I knew of Joe Rogan because\nhe's kind of everywhere when you're scrolling through any podcast app. So then in 2020, Spotify was like, I want a piece of this\nlike giant popular podcast. And they bought the exclusive\nrights to the podcast for $200 million. - Which is unbelievably insane. - This was a huge deal for Joe\nRogan but also for podcasts. - (laughs)\n- Let's (bleeps) go. - Even after this big deal, the show retained its unfiltered quality. It still was Joe Rogan sitting\naround chatting with mostly dudes, talking openly\nand unfiltered for hours. - You don't know what a bear is. I've seen a bear in a wild, when you see a bear in the\nwild, you're like, oh you're, you don't give a (bleeps) about me. - Often getting progressively\nmore high with his guest. - Do people get upset at you\nif you do certain things? Just tobacco and marijuana in there. - I'm getting text messages from friends saying, what the hell are\nyou doing smoking weed? - [Johnny] Okay, so my job\nhas apparently turned into getting super deep into watching stuff that I never watched before, like North Korean films\nand now Joe Rogan podcasts. Like I've dedicated a\nsignificant amount of my time over the past several months\nto watching this show. And even still, I'm just\nscratching the surface. These episodes are long. They're like two and a\nhalf hours on average and there are almost 2000 of them. We're talking thousands\nand thousands of hours of this stuff. Luckily for this story I had\nhelp from our story producer, Alex, to help us listen\nto a lot of this stuff. I also spoke with some\nlongtime Joe Rogan listeners for some insight and here in\nthe office, we actually had some pretty nice heated\ndebates about Joe Rogan. (jazzy music plays) And now after my baptism by Joe Rogan, I now have some big takeaways,\nsome things I wanna say. Number one, Joe hates boxes and people love that he hates boxes. He spends a lot of time\nlambasting our society's need to fit people into buckets, into labels. - I think this left right\nparadigm is really kind of (bleeps) foolish at this point. - And indeed, it's fairly\nimpossible to put Joe Rogan into the standard ideological\nboxes that we're all sort of pressured to fit into. Most of our media discourse loves boxes, loves to inflame our super identities, the things that we must\nbelieve in order to be a good liberal or a good conservative. - What kind of opinions are\nokay to have because they don't interfere with anybody else's life? And it's just your philosophy\nand the way you look at the world. And you should be able to\nexpress that opinion and express those ideas in front of someone\nelse who has an opposing idea and they tell you why they disagree. - And so before I listened to\na million hours of the show, I had mostly seen Joe Rogan\nin the context of like short little edited clips of like\nSmackDown showing like some egregious thing that Joe\nRogan had said that he was transphobic or fat phobic\nor misogynistic or racist. There's a lot of these mashups out there. - She's giant like look\nat the size of her head. Her formerly male head. That's a giant woman.\nWe walk into (bleeps). We walked in (bleeps), dude, we walked in the door and\nthere was no white people. There was no white people. - Wow. That video's so bad. It actually made me miss the N word video. - And when you watch this stuff, it's so easy to just\nlike slot him into like, oh he must be like some far\nright sort of like racist, reactionary commentator. So I was surprised honestly\nwhen I listened to a lot of this guy to find out that\nhis politics actually lean mostly left. - She's the wife of the best\npresident that we have had in our lifetime. - He openly and earnestly voices\nsupport for everything from universal healthcare to\nabortion to gay marriage to recreational drugs. - I lean way left when it\ncomes to those kind of things, gay rights and things\nlike social programs for disenfranchised people and\ndisenfranchised communities. I lean way, way like if I\nwant my tax dollars to go to anything, I want it to go to making\npeople's lives easier. I'm not right wing at all.\n- Oh okay. - No that's wild. - No, there's nothing about me. That's right wing. - He even endorsed Bernie\nSanders, the Democratic socialist in 2020 after having him on the show. - There's not a single\nhuman that could speak for all the American people. - No, I hate that. - That could look out for the interest of the American people and I think Bernie Sanders\ndefinitely does do that. - You got three people owning\nmore wealth in the bottom half of the American society. You don't see that on\ntelevision too much do you? - [Joe] No you don't. - Three people, you got the top 1% owning\nmore wealth in the bottom 92%. - What are the misconceptions of you? 'Cause here's the, if you go to the knee jerk\nconservative reaction, you talk to people who are\nnot interested in anyone that wants to be a Democratic socialist, they hear the name Bernie Sanders. The negative implications\nare that you are somehow or another going to\ntake their money. Right? Is that annoying to you? - Yes it is, of course it is. - Oh and here he is with\npresidential hopeful Andrew Yang agreeing with him on the super\nprogressive idea of universal basic income. - My initial knee jerk reaction was get the (bleeps) outta here. Like universal basic income. I'm just gonna give people money. They're just gonna be lazy.\nNothing's ever gonna get done. That's a terrible idea. And then I started paying\nattention to the rise of AI and automation and how many\njobs are gonna get taken away. - Yes, yes.\n- From, and then once you see the actual\nnumbers, it's pretty staggering. - But despite thinking that\nhe presents his ideas in this very kind of anti woke,\nanti-political correctness, say whatever you want type of vibe. And this is confusing\nbut also very appealing. People love to listen to a guy\nwhose views and language are all over the place. I think for a lot of people\nit's like a respite from the predictable lineup of\npopular voices that toe a predictable list of beliefs,\nopinions, views, and enemies. Rogan's style is rare and\nI think people like that. Which gets me to my second big takeaway. Joe Rogan sells Contrarianism. That is his product. A quick reminder that Joe\nRogan isn't just a guy, he is a commercial icon, a seasoned performer who performs\nfor an audience for money. He knows what people want\nand he is selling something very popular, an alternative\nto the endless reductionist polarized name calling\nof our current discourse. - [Joe] They all do the same move. They drop down and do the splits. - That's what I think when\nI'm watching your shows too. You know, all the same stuff. - [Joe] But. (laughs) - And he goes to great lengths\nto stake himself out as this anti-authority,\nanti-establishment platform where anyone can come and talk. - If you are in one camp, you're supposed to have all\nthe opinions that one camp has. And if you do not align\nwith all the opinions of that one camp has, you find\nyourself cast out of the group. - No woke police, no\nmainstream media bias, no corporate deception,\njust an earnest, curious guy trying to find the truth and\nnot really worrying too much about changing his language to fit the politically correct\nsensitivities of the day. - What I didn't anticipate\nwas social media and the echo chambers\nthat it would provide. And that these ideological\necho chambers also come with virtue signaling and that people\nget on these things 'cause you're only dealing with a\nshort amount of characters and you state something\nthat you know is gonna get a bunch of likes and people\nare very addicted to likes. - The fans I talk to love\nthis about Joe Rogan. Like, he's like the antidote\nto like the corporate, mainstream biased media\nthat's polarizing us all. And frankly I think he leans\ninto this as his brand. Which gets me to my third point. And this is where I have my\nbiggest critique of Joe Rogan. Joe lets people talk and\ntalk and talk and talk. - The principles of human\ninteraction on this planet are largely dictated by our\nability to discuss things. Even if you disagree. - As we've seen, Joe has had a huge variety\nof guests on his show. A lot of these are like\nfamous people that you just get to watch, talk in this\nsort of unfiltered way like Robert Downey Jr or Miley Cyrus. But then you also have a lot\nof people with big opinions and big points of view from\nsuper mainstream and respected voices to experts on like\nreally specific science things. But then you have a handful of a lot of controversial fringe characters, people who have been\n\"censored\" or \"canceled\" by the mainstream media. And honestly I think Joe takes\nhuge pride in having this spectrum of different points of view. Now, I don't know Joe Rogan, but my guess is that half\nof this is his personality. He seems to be a guy who\nloves to discuss things with people. He seems\nto have an open mind. But I think half of this, again, is a response to the upkeep of his brand. I think he likes the appeal\nof being this anti mainstream platform where anyone who has\nbeen canceled by the woke mob can come and get their fair shake, tell their side of the story. - I mean it's, you don't\nhave to agree on everything in order to have a common\nsense of the important values that that unify the country or should. - And here comes my big critique. I think there's a fallacy\ntucked into all of this. When Joe has these people\non, it almost feels like he's giving them a chance to\ntell their side of the story. Like they don't have a\nplace to tell their side and they've been unfairly censored. But I think this is flawed thinking. Not everyone who has a point\nof view and who is famous has ideas worth hearing or\ndebating in our society. I really believe that. There are people who've\ngotten famous simply because they've made a career off\nof being loud and mean. And human nature loves\nthat for some reason the. - The (bleeps) Senate\n(bleeps) voted to kill babies. - Like here's a show with Gavin McInnes. - I started this gang\ncalled The Proud Boys. And-\n- The Proud Boys? - The Proud Boys. - [Joe] What is, what's Proud Boys about? - A far right extremist group\nthat promotes white supremacy ideology and proudly promotes\nviolence against groups they don't agree with. - Four members of the Proud\nBoys, that far right extremist organization while they've\nbeen found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their roles\nin the January 6th attack on the Capitol. - Like here he is fondly\nremembering the time his group violently attacked people\nwho were protesting Milo Yiannopoulos at Berkeley. - He goes I started feeling batting it. I started feeling bad after\na while 'cause I was just, I could tell these kids\nhad never been in a fight and I was just mowing\nthrough them. (laughs) - I mean, I don't know, like having a guy on your show\nwho espouses the view that lenient immigration and\nabortion among white women is leading to \"white genocide\" in the West, doesn't feel like fruitful,\nrobust dialogue that will open all of our minds and push the\nboundaries of our discourse. It feels like outraging people with old tribal ideas to get attention. And this is my critique, is\nlike it feels like sometimes Joe will have these people\non because they say and do reprehensible things, not in spite of it. - I'm taking the low road,\nI'm punching them in the face. - [Joe] So that's what you're\ndoing with this outfit. - They think they can ruin his\nwork 'cause he jerked off in front of some people. - You know, I'm not gonna\nbow down before them and say, you were right and they want\nme to, but they weren't right. I'm right. I wrote it (bleeps). - Again, his brand is the\nanti-establishment place where you won't get censored by the woke police. But listen, Joe is absolutely right. Being able to say things no\nmatter how much I disagree with them, is a vital right. It is an unnatural and precarious thing. People should be able to speak\nand we must protect that. I believe that. And Joe should absolutely\nlegally be allowed to give his giant megaphone to whoever he wants. But that doesn't mean I'm\nnot gonna critique it because listen, having this open-minded, likable guy who's very\ngood at entertaining us, give his megaphone to other\ndudes who promote violence, who tear down science, who invent fake facts and talk\nabout them like they're real. It doesn't promote curiosity.\nIt normalizes lying. It validates factlessness. Which is something that\nif you haven't heard, we already have a problem with.\nWe're already battling that. - Nuclear bombs actually don't exist. That they never actually figured it out. But they realize that the\nthreat of nuclear bombs is good enough 'cause. - [Joe] But Eddie, you can see the bombs. - Atom bombs, you can watch.\n- But how do you know that by seeing\nthem that they're real? - And this feeling really\nhit me when I was listening to the episode with Alex Jones. Alex Jones, a man who has\ncreated an empire off of promoting lies and warped\ninformation so that he can sell health supplements. - Our fertility is being\ntargeted and it's dropping across the western world. Ladies and gentlemen, Anthro Plex is the newest\nedition in infowarslife.com. - [Johnny] A man who was\nrecently ordered to pay $1.5 billion in damages to\nthe families of the Sandy Hook shooting victims for spreading lies about the shooting being a hoax. And yet here he is on\nthe Joe Rogan Experience, getting a chance to tell\nhis side of the story. - When I started getting\naccused four years ago, a couple years into it, and I said no, I think it happened then\npeople that I had interviewed and things started saying he's\ninvolved. He's one of them. - [Joe] Because you are now\nsaying that it happened, they thought that you\nhad been compromised. - Yes. And then I was realizing, oh. - [Joe] This is how it works. - A certain percentage of\npeople are schizophrenic. And then they just think\neverything's a conspiracy. - Now listen, I'm gonna\ntell you the truth right now and admit something, which\nis that when I watched this, I actually had a moment\nwhere I was like, oh my God. Like here's Alex Jones in this\nlike very calm environment. He's not like yelling\nlike he does on Infowars. - My heart's big, it's got hot\nblood going through it fast. I like to eat, I like to have children. - And I literally thought\nlike, wait, is Alex Jones like, was he wrongfully accused or\nwas this overly exaggerated? Was this like a witch\nhunt to censor this guy because he's like kind\nof has far right views 'cause this felt like a proper\nmoment for Jones to tell his side of the story. - Well, I began to\nrealize because I was on the receiving end of people\npulling up in white vans with guns at my office saying, \"I know you put a microchip in my head and I'm gonna kill you.\" So I came out and I said, listen, I never sent anybody to the\nhouses, but I apologize. I was taking outta context. People have a right to question, but I'm sorry for the families\nand I'm sorry for your hurt. And I get it and I've experienced\ncrazy people now big time, just like you have.\nPlease stop saying that I'm saying it didn't happen. - And he nearly persuaded me. But wait, no, no. Then I remembered that my\nfull-time job is to do journalism. - No one died in 2012 in Sandy Hook. - And luckily I sit around\nand fact check things all day and I researched it and\nI reminded myself that there's actually not a ton of nuance here. The facts. Alex Jones repeatedly claimed\nthat the Sandy Hook shooting was a staged event\norchestrated by the globalists, the government, to promote gun control. - That's why the globalists\nused children's deaths to go after our guns 'cause\nthey know it gets to us. - He suggested that the grieving\nparents were crisis actors and that no children had actually died. - Early on, I said, well, they\nhad to have killed somebody. I mean, this doesn't make sense. Then parents come out and\nstart laughing and then turn to the camera and cry. - These grieving families who\nhad experienced unimaginable horror had to relocate\nbecause of the harassment they received in part due to\nJones' pedaling of this lie so that it could sell\n(bleeps) health supplements. These are facts that are\navailable to all of us, okay? And yet, I don't know about you, but if I weren't a full-time journalist, who was paid to go down\nrabbit holes and check facts, I'm not sure it would've\ngone and done this. I'm not sure I would've gone\nand reviewed all of the facts and wrestled with them in my mind, especially not after listening\nto two and a half hours of Alex Jones talking. I think the idea of trusting\nyour viewer to go fact check everything you say is\nirresponsible and naive. I spend every day of my life\nmaking sure that the things I tell you are factually accurate. If I get something wrong,\nit's a cardinal sin. In a world of algorithms\nand misinformation and Russian bots, it becomes\nnearly impossible to fact check everything you see. Which is why we rely on trusted\nvoices to help us navigate the information out there, to help us navigate what\nis real and what is not. So instead, Alex Jones, a\nman who makes money off lies, gets to tell his side of the\nstory and what does he do with his time? Surprise. He lies. - The amount of Sandy Hook\ncoverage against me has been so insane and so huge\nbecause it's supposed to be the first domino that\nonce I'm taking down that all the dominos fault. - He tells a story about how\nthis was all one big conspiracy to take him down. Now of course, there is more\nnuance to this conversation as usual. Rogan does\npush back a few times. - I don't think that's, I\nthink the majority of 'em are angry because the\nnarrative has been that you're sending people to these\nSandy Hook families' homes. - But, I guess I'm wondering why. Why is this the person that\nyou want on your show. Joe? You're a curious, open-minded\nguy and you've decided that this guy, this guy's\nvoice is who deserves your megaphone to 11 million people. And this doesn't even get to\nthe other hours that Jones has on Rogan's show where he\noutlines his theories on genetics and race. - Native Americans, you can\nmind control really fast. - [Joe] Hmm. Why is that? - Well, it's like Vietnam. So Asians are about the most\nfearless killers there are. - You're like Native Americans. They're the best out\nthere. They can do mind. Native Americans are the\neasiest to do mind reading to because you know, they're like\none unit and Asians, they're, it's just like so (bleeps) crazy. Oh, and this clip has less nuance. Like if you listen to the whole thing, you're actually just watching\nAlex Jones talking nonstop about totally bullshit\ntheories on race and genetics. And Joe is just sitting\nthere nodding his head. - Native Americans are\ngung-ho and they're tough and they're ready to fight. And I'm, you know, I'm part\nNative American only like 6% Comanche and, you know, Texas. And just that little bit makes me wild. - No, they're not breaking any laws. This is their right. But what the (bleeps). This\nisn't exploring both sides. This isn't nuanced conversation. This is pretend information\nframed as rigorous discussion, echoing ideas and thought\nprocesses that have been used for centuries to divide and demean people. This isn't balanced conversation. It's faulty logic and factlessness\ndisguised as discourse. I have no respect for it. And listen, Joe Rogan wouldn't disagree\nwith me fully on this. He knows that putting people\non his show helps them, helps their ideas. - And I'm, by the way, I'm not\na Trump supporter in any way, shape or form. I've had the opportunity\nto have him on my show more than once. I've said no every time. I don't wanna help him. - This isn't the public square. This isn't a personal\nconversation between friends sharing ideas. This is a powerful man who\ncommands the attention of millions of people. He has decisions on who\nhe gives his megaphone to and who he does not, and what\nfacts he decides to challenge and which he does not. Okay, wait, but I'm not done. There's nuance to my critique, which is that sometimes\nletting people with ideas that I find reprehensible\ntalk is actually really good. Most of Joe Rogan's\nguests are not Alex Jones. They're honestly interesting,\nstimulating conversations with a lot of really interesting people. And even the ones I disagree with, there is so much value\nin letting them talk. Like I listened to this\ntwo hour conversation with Candace Owens, a political pundit, who I deeply disagree with. I mean, she's called Trump the savior of Western civilization. She's called Black Lives Matter\na bunch of whiny toddlers pretending to be oppressed for attention. I deeply disagree with this woman. After listening to the\nshow with Candace Owens, I still deeply disagree\nwith Candace Owens. In fact, I found more reasons\nto reject her approach to politics and facts. - So let's say we all agree\nthat global warming is real. I don't believe it's real.\nOkay, so I can't sit here. - [Joe] But why? But here's the question, but can't but why have a belief? - [Candace] What do you mean? - Why have a belief as to\nwhether or not global warming is real or not real? - Because I just find that\nthings you don't, you're correct. - But, crucially, suddenly\nwhat I couldn't do was hate her like was so easy before, it's\nreally hard to hate someone when you listen to them speak. - I received some voicemail\nmessages from about four kids and that like, you know, the language was, it was pretty strong. It was like, we're gonna\ntar and feather your family. We're gonna put a bullet\nin the back of your head like we did to Martin Luther King. Like, you know, N word, N word, N word. - You inconveniently have to\nsee them as a real human with feelings and thoughts and ideas. And it becomes a lot harder\nto just put them into a bucket as someone I should hate, which\nof course, as we all know, is a huge thing that\nwe've lost in our world of echo chambers, where we\nonly hear from people that we agree with. And when we do hear from\npeople we disagree with, it's often framed in an\noutrageous clickbaity article linked on Twitter entitled, watch the Senator that you agree with destroy the person you disagree with and reinforce your views\nthat they're a monster and that you are justified in hating them. This is how I knew Candace\nOwens before I listened to her speak for two hours, but\nnow I see her as a person, a human who holds views that\nI see as objectively bad for people and our society. But I can't dehumanize her. - Somebody started doing this\nprank calling shit on you and was this- - Was all in one night.\n- It was all in one night. - Yeah. It was like four voicemails. - Was this tied to like a boyfriend or. - No. So I was at\n- Or a girl was jealous. - A boyfriend's house when\nI got the calls and I just like put to silent 'cause\nit was like blocked number. So I was like, I didn't\nthink anything of it. And then like when I listened to it, like it was like some\npretty horrific stuff. Like I definitely cried, you\nknow, I was 17 years old. - And this gets me to my\nlast takeaway and then, we'll finish up this video, which is that Joe Rogan\nmodels curiosity and openness. And this is valuable. It is rare and unique to\nwatch a tough guy fighter, TV host, dirty comedian\nwith a microphone admit that he's wrong. - Here's the thing, these are\nnot like planned statements. Let's be real clear. I don't have an off air and on-air voice. I don't, no, I have me, this is it. - You typically don't see stuff like this. - Do I get things wrong? Absolutely, I get things wrong,\nbut I try to correct them. - And when it comes to\npowerful men in this world, most of the loudest voices\nare the ones promoting a confident, macho, nightmare\nversion of masculinity. - Nobody would be tougher\non ISIS than Donald Trump. - And while I don't vibe\nwith all of the ways that Joe expresses his manhood, I think he is a force for good\nin this department in showing an eagerness to ask questions\nand an ability to change his mind. And yet, as I mentioned earlier, my critique is that I think\nhe overuses this persona, this confident, curious persona\nof I don't know anything. I'm not an expert. - Like, if you say you disagree with me, I probably disagree with me too. When I say something stupid,\nI'm not thinking about what I'm gonna say before I say it, right? I'm just saying it. - To tacitly validate\ndeceiving information and to give voice to\nopportunistic characters. And so in the end, I'm not\nreally sure if this modeling of an open mind outweighs the\nproliferation of seductively fake facts and ideas, especially in a time where\ntruth and facts are already scarce and under siege and\ncreating confusion for all of us. - Dude, they're keeping, they\nhave human animal hybrids. There's the fricking, I\nhave been there when people that work for the Pentagon say that they, we go to the laboratory and\nwe meet with the ambassador. We have to take higher and\nhigher doses to meet with 'em. And they're giving us technology.\nAnd the technology works. - I don't even think it's\nclear that carbon dioxide is actually a problem, but\nwe can leave that aside. - They say that that 80% of\nkids who experience any sort of gender dysphoria as\nchildren grow out of it. - This tension is not unique to Rogan. All media, all news\noutlets are subject to this seductive temptation to\nappeal to the worst parts of our nature. Rogan's version of it is unique because he and his show are unique. So for how much I disagree\nwith some of his standards and fact checking habits,\nI do take comfort in this guy's commitment to\nopenness, to curiosity. Joe Rogan is a powerful\nman who changes his mind, who admits when he's wrong, which I think is a much\nneeded counterbalance in an increasingly polarized world. - And sometimes the best way\nto combat bad speech is to let that speech play out and let\ngood speech overwhelm it with logic and reason and a better argument. - But if they admit that they're wrong, then they're also admitting\nthat they have horribly disfigured and abused thousands,\nmaybe millions of kids. - [Joe] How many people\nhave had this done? - Depends on what I don't\nthink we have exact numbers, but it's, if we're talking\nabout the drugs, it's, I mean, millions. - It says over the last five\nyears there were at least 4,780 adolescents who started puberty\nblockers and had a prior gender dysphoria diagnosis. A million sounds great. Yeah. - Wifi radiation is, does all kinds of bad things\nincluding causing cancer. - Wifi radiation causes cancer? - Yeah, from your cell phone, I mean there's cell phone\ntumors, you know that. I mean, I'm representing\nhundreds of people who have cell phone tumors behind the ear. It's always on the ear that\nyou favor with your cell phone. - Okay. Hey everyone, thanks for watching my big\nlong video essay on Joe Rogan. I've been thinking about\nthis one for a long time. Lemme tell you about a couple of things. First off, I made a\nposter, a physical product, a thing that exists in the\nreal world after a decade of making things that only exist in pixels. So look. This is a poster called\nAll Maps are Wrong. It's a bunch of different map projections, all the different mathematical\nways that we can show the world, which is a\nsphere on a flat plane. This is a poster that you can\npurchase and put on your wall and help support this channel, which is very appreciated. For other ways to support the channel, you can look at The Newsroom. The Newsroom is our Patreon\nwhere our Newsroom members support us and they get\nin exchange an extra video every month, which is a\nbehind the scenes vlog. All of the shenanigans and\nthe methods and the people and the processes and the\neverything that we do here in the studio, we capture\nand we put into a vlog that you can watch. But really it's about supporting\nwhat we're trying to do here, which is independent journalism, which takes a lot of time and resources. We also have luts and presets. Luts are how we color our video. Presets are how I color photos. We develop these with\na professional colorist and they're very good. And you can buy them, support\nthe channel and use them. First off, if you're new\naround here and you're still watching the video, you must be super into\nwhat we're doing here. Like you're at the very end\nof like a super long video and you're still watching\nand you're new around here. You should probably subscribe. All right, bye. (indistinct conversation) - [Speaker 2] Go get outta here, dude."

    "captions": "(dramatic music) - There's this house in this\nneighborhood in New Jersey that actually isn't a house. It's hard to see, because\nit's behind this gate, but if you look at it from above, you'll see that it's actually\na really large building. Kind of looks like a warehouse. It has dozens of air conditioning units and it's just sitting here among a sea of ordinary suburban homes. All of this is just a facade\nhiding this massive building that is a landing station for AT&T, the place where these\nmassive undersea cables that connect the world,\nhit the eastern seaboard. (suspenseful music) We now know for certain\nthat the U.S. government spies on those cables with the\nhelp of companies like AT&T. And according to a\nleaked map from the NSA, they process all the\ndata that they collect somewhere in New Jersey in\na facility called Pinecone. Lining up these maps points to this secretive disguised building\nas one of the best candidates for where this surveillance\nis being processed. But there's a lot more\nof these hidden buildings around the country. Thanks to leaked NSA documents and some thorough investigative reporting, we now know some of their locations. Like the fake house in New Jersey, these other cable spy facilities blend in as benign, nondescript buildings avoiding any undue attention along the streets of New York\nor San Francisco or Dallas. These few hundred cables\nthat connect our world contain an unfathomable amount of data, all of our communication,\nall of our connections, and it would seem impossible\nthat any government agency would be able to spy on it all, impossible, that is, if\nwe didn't have solid proof that they do. So let me tell you the story of the cables that connect our planet and show you that if\nyou can tap into them, you can watch the world and they have, and they've been doing it for a long time. - [Reporter 1] 320\nmillion records every day. - [Reporter 2] What\nwe're talking about here is a total revolution of the whole concept of war.\n- Collect it all, exploit it all. (TV static) - Now is the moment where I\nsay thank you to the sponsor of today's video. I'm very grateful for sponsors. I wouldn't be able to do this job and make independent journalism\nif we didn't have sponsors. So thank you Incogni for\nsponsoring today's video. Incogni is actually quite\nrelevant to today's video, because Incogni is\nsuper-interested in data privacy. We live in a world where there's an entire secretive industry dedicated to collecting\ninformation about you and no, this isn't the NSA spying on you. This is for-profit\ncorporations who spy on you in any way they can, so they can sell that to other companies who\ncan then market to you, who can into your phone, who\ncan try to make you buy things. I find this incredibly\nfrustrating and violating that my personal information\nis bought and sold on an open market. Luckily, we have rights\nto make this not happen. The problem is the process\nof making it not happen is very complicated and\nthis gets me to Incogni. Incogni is a service\nthat does this for you. You sign up for Incogni and\nyou give them permission to go out into the world on your behalf and take you off as\nmany lists as they can. The first thing they do,\nand this is very satisfying, is they scan to see all of\nthe lists that you're on and they show it to you on\nthis really nice dashboard so you can see, oh my God, I'm on dozens if not hundreds\nof these marketing lists. And then they start the process\nof securing your privacy, of getting your email and your\naddress and your phone number off these lists. It's a process and Incogni\nwill keep you updated on the progress. They even have a tally of all of the lists that you've been removed from, which is insanely satisfying\nto keep an eye on. Because of Incogni, I\nlearned that here in the U.S. there's this other massive problem, which are these people search sites where you can search for\npeople and it will pull up as much information as\nthe site has on you. I don't like that. Incogni sniffed this out for me and is taking me off of these lists. Thank you, Incogni, I'm\nvery grateful for it. So there's a link in my description. It's incogni.com/Johnny\nHarris and you can go over sign up for Incogni and\ntry it out for 30 days and get a full refund if\nyou don't think it's useful, totally risk-free. I'm really grateful to Incogni for sponsoring our\njournalism in this video, but I'm also grateful that they exist, because I am so tired\nof my inbox and my phone and my mailbox being full of garbage. Okay, with that we're\njumping back into the video about the government version\nof collecting your data. (videotape clicks) We laid the first copper cable across the Atlantic Ocean in 1858. It connected Ireland to Canada. They sent the first\ntelegram across this wire and it took 18 hours to arrive, which was like light-speed back then. The cable broke three weeks\nlater, but even still, it was a huge success, a revolution for a world\nwhose progress hinged on being more and more connected. - [Narrator] Through a single cable, only an inch and a quarter thick, which lies on the ocean bed. - [Johnny] The planet would be linked up by many more of these cables draped along the ocean floor, allowing us to call\npeople across the world and eventually allowing\nus to access information through webpages hosted\non servers far, far away. - An online network called internet. - Today, there are 1.4 million\nkilometers worth of cables linking us all up and they\ntransfer a ton of data, like the fastest cables can transfer 224 terabytes per second, and the amount of data being\nsent around the world doubles every two to three years. Unsurprisingly, there's a whole industry dedicated to just laying down these cables and then monitoring\nthem and repairing them when they break. Sometimes they get broken by\nfishing trawlers or anchors or natural disasters. Sometimes they even get broken by sharks, though that's pretty rare, but sometimes these cables\nare broken on purpose. There's this island right\noff the coast of China, but it technically belongs to Taiwan, the country that China has\nvowed to eventually absorb into their own. Needless to say, there's\na lot of tension here and in the last five years, the cables of this little island have accidentally been broken 27 times, which is a lot for cables. China denies that they had any\npart in these 27 accidents. They say it's just an unfortunate fishing or anchor incident, but I'm suspicious. - [Reporter 3] Officials fear\nthat Matsu is just a warning and that internet connections\nto the whole of Taiwan could be under threat. - Sometimes it's unclear\nwho attacks these cables. Like a few years ago\nwhen somebody ripped out a two and a half mile piece of this cable that connects Norway to\nthe island of Svalbard. Other times it's very clear\nwho's cutting the cables. Like when the United States\nwas at war with Saddam Hussein in the nineties and\nthey cut Saddam's cable so that he couldn't communicate. I mean, cutting the communication\ncables of your enemy is an old strategy. They were doing that way back\nin the American Civil War, but the more interesting approach\nto me isn't just sabotage. There's another way\nthat you can use cables to your advantage if you are a great power trying to control things. (electronic music) If you have access to submarine cables, which governments and militaries do, you can scrape through the\ninsulation of this cable. You can splice in another cable and you can duplicate the signal and hear everything your enemy is saying. (people speaking in foreign language) The British Navy did this\nto a German submarine cable out here in the middle of the\nAtlantic, during World War I. The Germans suspected that\nthey were being listened to, so they sent all their\ncommunication as complex codes, but the British had\nvery smart code breakers and they were able to decrypt all of this and discover a lot of Germany's secrets, and they discovered this\nsecret plan that Germany had to ally with Mexico and\ninvade the United States. This is one reason why the\nU.S. ended up joining the war, and it all happened because\nof submarine cable tapping. (uptempo beat music) World War II took cable\ntapping to a whole new level. A more connected world\nmeant more opportunities for vital military\ninformation to leak out. So the U.S. created a new agency where they would tap in and monitor hundreds of thousands of civilian\ntelegrams and phone calls flowing through both the mail, but also through these submarine cables. I mean, think about it,\nit was a scary time. It was global war, it\nwas mass destruction, so mass surveillance on\nyour people felt necessary in the name of national security. - [Reporter 4] Even the insides\nof envelopes are scrutinized for hidden writing by these sensors. - This agency was shut\ndown after World War II, but the seeds of mass\nsurveillance were now planted. (techno music) A few years later, President Harry Truman creates\na new secret department, the National Security Agency or NSA. Their job was to secretly\ncollect and analyze communication happening in the country, communication that was not meant for them, spying on communication of all kinds, all in the name of national security. By the time the United\nStates and the Soviet Union are locked in a Cold War, spying\nbecomes even more valuable, even more of a priority\nfor these governments, and once again, underwater\ncables become a target. The Americans built this\nentire spy submarine, which had a secret space set\naside for intelligence officers and a giant computer. They called this space the bat cave. Of course, they did, a\nbunch of military dudes on a submarine and they've\ngot their secret computers, like, \"We're in the bat cave.\" I can totally see it. This submarine called the USS Halibut had a little mini-submarine-looking thing that was actually not a mini-submarine, but rather a pressurized\nchamber full of special gas that divers would just\nsit in there and breathe. It was pressurized to\nfeel like the deep ocean so that these divers could\ngo out into the ocean and be 400 feet under the surface and their bodies were\nready for the pressure. They used this to secretly\nnavigate to underwater cables. The one we know about happened\nover here right off the coast of Eastern Russia. The divers would leave their\npressurized gas chamber. They would navigate this big, clunky electric listening device onto the cable. It's basically a giant 20' recorder that would tap into the cable and record everything passing through. They somehow parsed through the\ndozens of different signals, specific phone calls\nbetween Soviet officials, but of course, this is the analog days, so the storage on this\ndevice would fill up, so they had to go back with\ntheir little bat cave submarine every few months to replace the tape. They did this for 10 years. This was called Operation Ivy Bells, and we talked about it a little\nbit in the whole deep dive we did on submarines. But boy, it just never\nceases to blow my mind how resource-intensive this operation was. (water bubbles) Anyway, through this\ntapping on the Soviet cable, the Americans learned just\nhow scared the Soviets were by the buildup of nuclear weapons. This helped them negotiate a slowdown in the nuclear arms race\nand even helped lead to the end of the Cold War\naccording to one expert. By the early nineties,\nthe Cold War was over. - [President Clinton]\nThe change of centuries, the dawning of a new millennium. - But then came a world changing attack into the ultraconnected internet age. - This new law that I signed today will allow surveillance\nof all communications used by terrorists, including emails, the internet, and cell phones. This government will enforce this law with all the urgency of a nation at war. It is now my honor to sign into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001. (audience applauds) - In 2006, a leaked document revealed that in a nondescript building in San Francisco behind this random\nyellow door labeled 641A, the NSA had set up this\nharmless-looking box that tapped into the fiber optic cables that traversed the\nPacific Ocean into Asia. The phone company AT&T had\nagreed to let them siphon off the traffic that was moving\nthrough their cables. This seemed kind of nuts that\nthe U.S. was tapping a cable where all of our\ncommunication goes through, but we had no idea what was coming. In 2013, Edward Snowden, an NSA contractor unleashed\none of the biggest leaks in American history. - This is the greatest hemorrhaging of a legitimate American secrets in the history of the Republic. - And that is what we\nhave been looking through. I mean, there's a lot more documents, but we sifted through\nand found the documents that show us that it wasn't just one cable in San Francisco being tapped. The NSA was targeting every single cable that touched the United States, a huge amount of global traffic, email, text messages, phone calls. They had cooperation from all these telecommunication\nand tech companies to do this. Microsoft, Yahoo, Google,\nFacebook, PalTalk? The hell is PalTalk? Who knows, but the NSA\nwas tapping their cables. YouTube, Skype, AOL,\nand even Apple by 2012, and their goal in all of this, well, according to one of these slides, the goal was to sniff it all,\nknow it all, collect it all, process it all, exploit\nit all, partner it all. In other words, according\nto another leaked slide, to master the internet. There's this one spreadsheet in all of these leaked\ndocuments that really said it, here it is. This is a list, a spreadsheet\nof some of the cables that the NSA had access to, we literally know which ones. I mean, we have the data\nof all of these cables. We could literally map all of these from the southern cross cable that connects California to Australia, to the Apollo cable that\nconnects New York to France, to the tiny cables that\nconnect Puerto Rico to the British Virgin Islands. All in all, by 2009, the NSA had stuck a probe in\nhundreds of submarine cables all around the globe. Oh, and they didn't do it alone. The NSA partnered with the OG masters of\nCable-tapping, the British. - Since the 1940s, GCHQ and\nits American equivalence have had a relationship\nthat is unique in the world. - Okay, so there's a\nweird loophole thing here. U.S. law allows the NSA to track anyone outside of the United States, but there are restrictions when it comes to tracking\nAmerican citizens. So to get around that, they turn to their British\ncounterparts, the GCHQ. So over the course of a couple\nyears in the early 2010s, the NSA is paying 100 million\npounds in secret money to gain access to all of this data, this data that they call\na gold mine to exploit, hundreds of thousands of names,\nover 76,000 geocoordinates, 194 million messages collected per day. And unlike the NSA, the British could actually\nspy on American targets, but the point is they were\nin it to collect it all. - If information arrives in\nthe UK from the United States, it's governed by our laws. The system works as intended. (suspenseful music) - Okay, okay, yeah, it's a lot of data, but what can you do with\n600 million phone events worth of data? That's way too much for any\nhuman to actually process, and this is where it\ngets kind of nuts to me. We've got this slide, which by the way, I know that we're dealing with\nreally top secret documents, but they all have clip-art\nand these templatized Windows 95-looking\ntitles, freaking love it. (jazzy drum music) This slide, this complicated,\nwonky, wonky slide with this flow chart is\nthe answer to what they do with all of this data, but\nhere's basically how it works. So the NSA gets all of this data of all of our communication, either from cables or\nfrom phone companies. They funnel it through this central processing\nfacility called Pinecone. This is presumably\nwhere they're processing a lot of this data and\ntrying to find patterns. The NSA says that their job is\nto find suspected terrorists or other people who want to\ndo harm to national security. And to do this, they use\ncomputers and algorithms to make links between suspected terrorists and their immediate network,\nthe people they call, the people they talk to, where they are. They say they only hold\non to those records and they throw out everything else. We don't know if that's true,\nbut let's just assume it is. And then once it's all\nprocessed and sorted, it goes into a little searchable\ndatabase called XKeyscore, which is a very clunky name, but hey, great graphic design once again. This is basically like\na internal search engine that catalogs all of the metadata that has been assigned to all of this call message\ngeolocation information and makes it searchable. So you could pull up a\nperson, a suspected terrorist, and you could find everything\nyou need to know about who they talk to, where they\nare, what their emails say, or in their words, anything\nyou wish to extract. It's all searchable on\nthis convenient platform. This allows them to do searches like let's look for an Arabic font, Google query coming out of\nthe tribal areas of Pakistan, and boom, they're linked in. It's all right here in\nXKeyscore the database. Because of the globally connected world, the NSA now has access to this person. They can see what\nmessages they're sending. They can see where they are right now, assuming they have their phone, all searchable in this\nconvenient database, accessible to agencies\nfrom other countries and all over the world. The whole assumption here is that in order to find your target, the\nterrorist, the spy, whatever, you need to access all of the information, this turns metadata into a\nweapon of modern warfare. - We kill people based on metadata, but that's not what we\ndo with this metadata. (suspenseful music) - This revelation, all of these documents, this whole Snowden drama was a big deal for a lot of reasons. One of the things it did is it made the location of\ncables really important. Most of the cables were going\nthrough the United States, but after this leak, countries started to look\nfor alternative routes that bypassed the United States, like this one that connects\nBrazil to South Africa and then goes on to Asia. So over the last decade since these leaks, the U.S. has become less\nand less the epicenter of cable connection, and you guessed it, there's another player in town who wants access to cables, China. (suspenseful music) China is rapidly building out their worldwide network of cables, and they're doing this through Chinese state-owned companies like Huawei. And this is adding yet another front in this emerging Cold War\ntension between great powers that want to lead the global system. It turns out that controlling\nand spying on cables is a requirement for global\nleadership in 2023, who knew? But unlike the U.S. who\npurports to protect privacy and civil liberties, but\nsecretly violates them, China doesn't even pretend. China has built a society\noff of mass surveillance and control of information. Like here's actual footage of\nhow China tracks the movement of its population through\nvisual recognition, through cataloging every face, every car. Information is power in this day and age, and just a couple years ago, the U.S. formed a new special\nunit with intelligence and regulation officials. It's a group called Team Telecom, and their job is to assess any\nnew projects, any new cables, and make sure that they aren't going to threaten or weaken U.S. interests. For example, there was this one cable that was supposed to\nconnect LA to Hong Kong. It was being built by Google and Facebook, and they were into the project, hundreds of millions of\ndollars into the project, and this Team Telecoms\nshut it down, too risky. We can't have our fiber optic cables going too close to China\nless they spy on us. This is making the map look really weird. You used to only have to have one major set of cables\nconnecting countries, but now you're starting to see duplicates. The Chinese lines and the American lines, each building out their own network, not connecting to each other. It's like the perfect\nsymbol of the tension that is rising between\nthese two superpowers. The bifurcated world\nthat we're moving into. China is connecting these\nsmall remote islands laying down cables. And these islanders are\nhappy to have fast internet, even if it comes from China\nand is probably being tapped. The continent of Africa, the U.S. and China are both\nlaying down competing lines. The country's caught in the middle of this understand what's going on. Two, aspiring hegemons vying for power, each involved in spying\nand sucking up information in their own way, but I guess it's worth it,\nbecause it means faster internet, it means connection to the world. Russia is even trying to get in on this with their aptly named\nPolar Express cable. And even though the old\nschool tapping into cables in the middle of the ocean\nto spy on your neighbor is kind of outdated now, there's some evidence that\nRussia might be still doing this. They've got this one\nship called the Yantar. It's a surface ship that\nis generally understood to be a spy vessel, and it's been spotted on the surface above where we know submarine\ncables are near Ireland or near Syria. Some think that they're\njust tapping into them like the old days, maybe using one of these mini-submarines. But even if they're not tapping into them, they're very presence above\nthe cable is kind of a threat. They could cut this cable at any moment. The U.S. who is very good at submarines has its own spy vessels, the most secretive one\nbeing the USS Jimmy Carter, and we have no idea what it's up to. Security experts speculate that it's probably tapping\ninto cables for some reason, somewhere at the bottom of the ocean. But a lot of people in\nthe industry are like, \"No, that's so old days, why bother?\" It's so much easier to\njust tap into them on land. You get way more data\nand you don't have to go to the bottom of the ocean. Meanwhile, the private companies\nin charge of these cables have started to up their own defenses. They're taking all\nthese extra precautions, including sending out\nthese submarine drones that just spend their time tracing along the bottom of the ocean, babysitting these cables and making sure that there's no damage\nor tampering going on. So I feel like I'm\ngonna say what I've said a bunch on the channel lately, which is we are entering a\nnew chapter in geopolitics. A globalized world is hyperconnected, but suddenly and unexpectedly, we're seeing a new set of divisions, countries not trusting each other anymore. Nations wanting to create\ntheir own separate systems, both economically, militarily, but also with the\ninfrastructure of the internet. A chapter where countries now\nare more skeptical than ever, especially great powers, great powers that are building\ntheir own infrastructure so that they can communicate\nand control information, not trusting the other half of the world to handle their data. We see Navies with secret\nships that cost close to a $1 billion a piece, and then we see everyone\nelse caught in the middle. And in the end, most of\nus just want fast internet connection with friends around the world and a feeling that we're safe. (suspenseful music) All right, thanks for\nwatching today's video. Just a little nugget here. We did this video, because we did the deep dive on submarines a few months ago. I don't know if anyone saw that, but it was in that reporting\nthat we came across the spying element of all of this. And I remember I asked all of you, do you want me to do this video? And you all said, yes. I got like so many comments\nthat were like, \"Yes.\" And so, we did it. And that is one thing I love about YouTube and being an independent\njournalist on YouTube is that I get to just ask you, I'm talking to you and be like, \"Hey, do you want this?\" And you're like, \"Yes.\" And I go, \"Okay,\" and I make it. And there's no corporate\nmiddleman who decides what we make. We make what you guys wanna see. So as always, you can pitch us ideas and we will hear them. For those who want to support\nmore fully in our kind of more intimate community, we have a Patreon called the Newsroom. The Newsroom is a place\nwhere you can support what we do here, but you also\nget in on a few benefits, including an extra behind\nthe scenes video every month where you get to see all of\nthe people and the processes and the shenanigans that\nhappen here in the studio. We have a big team and\nyou get to meet them, if you are a member of the newsroom. You get access to my scripts, you get access to Tom Fox music. But really you get access\nto the warm fuzzy feeling that you're supporting a YouTube channel that is trying to make rigorous journalism in a time where facts and\ntruth are kind of eroding. So if that floats your boat,\nwe would love your support. We also have luts and presets, which are like the thing\nwe use to color our videos and our photos. You could buy those and they\nhelp support the channel. We have a poster that I designed. I'm super into map projections, all the different ways\nyou can show a map shape, and I made a beautiful poster that has it. If you have that poster, I think a lot of you have\npurchased that poster, we actually sold out and\nwe're reprinting a new batch, so they should be in there. Don't quote me on that because\nthey could be sold out again. But anyway, if you have that\nposter, tag me or something, I wanna see what it looks\nlike out in the wild. I looked at it on a screen for months and now I have some here, but I don't know what it\nlooks like out in the wild, so share it with me. I think that's it. Anyway, that's all I've got. Thank you all for being here, and I'll see you in the\nnext video, bye-bye. - [Narrator] Although the\ncalls through the cable will be from many\nnations, in many tongues, the cable itself speaks\na single language to all that is the language of\nfriendship and cooperation between the men and women of\nFrance, West Germany, England, and the United States who conceived and brought to completion the cable to the continent."

    "captions": "(light organ music) - [Johnny] Joseph Smith,\nhe's someone I know well. He's the author of a worldview that I held for most of my life. I taught it to hundreds of\npeople when I was a missionary. It's a religion and a gospel\nthat I deeply believed it. One full of hope and meaning and community and unique stories. Stories about where we came\nfrom and where we're going. Let me show you what Joseph\nSmith built and how he did it. How a non-religious, uneducated\nkid in upstate New York created a global movement\nthat would gather huge numbers of followers in a very short\ntime and who were pushed out from town to town, often with violence. I wanna show you how these\npeople held onto the vision and mission that Joseph\nSmith taught, the building of a new utopian society, one\nfounded on celestial laws, one that was preparing\nfor the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus Christ. So let me tell you the\nstory of Joseph Smith, the church he built, and how that church and its\nmission still exists today. - [Speaker 1] It's okay, a\nmissionary and everyone's happy. - Hey, before we open up\nthis large can of worms that I've been thinking\nabout for many years, I want to thank the\nsponsor of today's video, the people who make this all possible. Thank you BetterHelp for\nsponsoring today's video. BetterHelp is kind of\nrelevant to today's video because BetterHelp is\na platform for therapy. A few years ago I started\nseeing a therapist every week, not because I had some\nclinical mental health issue that I was trying to address, but rather because I wasn't feeling good, I knew there was things\nin my life that I needed to work through and there\nare professionals for that. Going to therapy has changed my mind. It has changed my life, it has changed how I see the world and it has made my life\nbetter, very objectively. BetterHelp is a platform that makes therapy more\naccessible to more people.

So you can try it out at a\ndiscount, see if it fits for you. So I'm grateful to\nBetterHelp for existing, but also for sponsoring today's video. With that, let's dive back into this. Let's talk about the prophet Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith was born in the perfect place at the perfect time. It was the early 1800s and\nthe U.S. had just thrown off England to become a new country, and it was going through\nsome massive growing pains. Most of these new Americans who\nhad just left the old world, rejected a lot of old world\nthings, namely religion. Only 10% of white Americans regularly attended church at this time. So to help revive God, you have all these super\ncharismatic preachers who left the cities and went out to\nthe countryside to preach. And this led to an explosion\nof religious thought, especially in upstate New York. So now you have all these\nlike hyper reformist religions that were replacing old style,\nauthoritarian type churches. All these new wild religious flavors that were more emotional,\nexpressive and personal. I mean, none of us were\nalive at this time, but you can kind of imagine\nlike this brand new country founded on these new ideals. It was unprecedented times. America felt special and different, but also kind of scary. Revolution in the new world, new science, magical\ntechnology, new ideas, both wholesome and sinful, all of it speeding up\nat an increasing rate. For a lot of people this was a sign, a sign that the end of\nthe world was coming and that Jesus, like he prophesied, would come back to usher in\nthis thousand years of glory for those who believed in him. And a thousand years of\nfire, for those who didn't. This was called the Millennium. So a lot of these new churches that were cropping up kind\nof claimed to be the place that was preparing the\nearth for the second coming, like they were God's chosen\nadministrators on the earth in the final days before it all ended. It was scary, it was exciting, and God was talking to\npeople again in new ways. And this is the context that\nJoseph Smith was born into. In 1805, born to a mother who was swept up in the excitement of\nall these new religions and a father who wasn't\nreally religious at all. It was kind of like a lot\nof people at the time, a family that was religiously\nlost, but not for long. (suspenseful music) In addition to being a\nfrothy religious environment, upstate New York was also a place where people hunted for treasure. There was this culture\nof folk magic and legends that led to the search\nfor riches and jewels that were potentially\nburied by Spanish explorers or pirates of the past or artifacts that were hidden in Native\nAmerican burial mounds. And their methods for\nhunting for all this treasure were mystical and magical. They used seer stones, crystals, rods, visions through dreams, all of this to help them\nlocate buried treasure. And young Joseph Smith was very caught up in this treasure hunting craze. He wasn't educated, he\nbarely had any schooling he could kind of read and write. He wasn't religious, but from a young age he showed himself as a\nskilled treasure hunter. I mean, let's keep some perspective. In all of our research, we didn't find a single\nlike document showing that he actually found any treasure, but he managed to convey\nto the people around him that he was an expert treasure hunter, using mythical methods. So this is the context that\nyou need to know to really understand this story. We're in upstate New\nYork in the early 1800s. There is this frenzy of folk\nmagic and treasure hunting, and the place is a blaze\nwith religious fervor. And there's talk of the last days and the millennium of fire and glory that was coming any day now. But the story really begins\nin the spring of 1820. (birds chirpy)\n(folksy music) Joseph, a 14 year old boy\ngets curious about religion. And after visiting a bunch of churches and finding no answers, he decides to go into a\ngrove of trees to ask God, which church was true. This movie that we're watching right now, I know by heart because I've\nwatched it hundreds of times, of course, dubbed in Spanish. I was a missionary in Tijuana, and the first thing that I would teach people was this story. And I would often show them this movie. - [Joseph Smith] I kneeled\ndown and began to offer up the desires of my heart. - So Joseph Smith is in this grove and he's praying and after\na run in with the devil. - [Joseph Smith] Exerting all\nmy strength to call upon God. (suspenseful music) - He sees a pillar of light, brighter than the sun\ndirectly over his head. And within that light, he sees two people whose\nbrightness defy all description. He finds out that it's God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ. And Jesus goes on to tell\nhim that none of the churches that he's been investigating are true and that instead Joseph is being called to do the work of God, to\nrestore the real true church that had been lost from the earth. To restore this church, to prepare the world for\nthe second coming of Jesus and the millennium that he will usher in. This event is referred\nto as the first vision and it is the founding\nstory of the LDS Church, The Mormon Church, like\nmost people know it. As a member of the church from a very young age\nyou learn this story, you sing about it, you talk\nabout it, you study it, and every few years the church comes out with a new video version\nrepresenting the first vision. Okay, so this is just the beginning. A few years go by, Joseph\ndoesn't tell anyone about his vision, but by 1823, Joseph is a late teenager\nand one night he's sleeping in his like little humble\ncabin with his family and he says that an angel appears to him. The angel is named Moroni. By the way, if you ever\nsee a Mormon temple, big white building, you\nwill see a depiction of the angel Moroni on the top of that temple with a trumpet pointing east. But for now, he's an angel\nin Joseph Smith's room telling young Joseph that,\nyes, the second coming of Christ is right around\nthe corner and that yes, just like God and Jesus\ntold him a few years ago, he has been called to prepare the world for the second coming. And if that wasn't enough, Moroni tells him that there\nis a book that is written on golden plates that is buried in a hill near Joseph's house. The book is an important\nrecord of a group of Jews who left Jerusalem in 600\nBC and came to the Americas. Anyway, I'll explain that in just a second \"And don't worry,\" says\nMoroni, \"along with the plates, there's the gear you need to translate these plates into English.\" Joseph just needs to get a bit older and he'll be ready to\ntranslate the plates. At this point, Joseph tells his\nfamily what's been happening and they believe him. So by the time he's 21, he's\ninstructed to go to the hill, Cumorah, near his house\nand get the plates. Okay, so now Joseph Smith in his twenties, he's this uneducated,\nunreligious, treasure hunter, and he starts to focus in\non something totally new. In the words of one believing Mormon historian Richard Bushman, \"He starts to orient\nhimself away from treasure and towards translation\",\nhe's becoming a prophet. (suspenseful music) So Joseph says he goes\nand gets these plates and people try to rob him, but eventually he gets them secured. And in a little cabin in rural New York, Joseph begins the work\nof translating this stack of metal plates that no\none else is allowed to see. (suspenseful music) He would sit on one side of a curtain so that no one else could see, and he says he looked through these stones at the Egyptian engravings\non these golden plates, and they would turn into English, and then he would dictate\nthem out loud to a scribe, sometimes his wife or other\nearly believers who were supporting him and that\nscribe would write them down. At other points, Joseph didn't even need\nthe plates to translate. He could hide them somewhere else and he would use his personal seer stone, the one that he used back when\nhe was just a treasure hunter before he says he was called as a prophet, this little chocolate\ncolored egg shaped stone. He would put it into a hat and\nthen he would bury his face in the hat and he said that\nthe stone would light up with the word that he was\nsupposed to dictate to his scribe. His scribe would write it down and the Book of Mormon was being written. Now listen, all of this seems really weird and wild to us now,\nvery easily like, okay, clearly this guy's making it up, but at the time, mystical\nvisions and treasure hunting and seer stones, this was\nall very normal in society. Folk magic, native American artifacts, none of this was very fringe. And Joseph, Joseph had been doing stuff like this for a decade,\nwhich is why his parents and other people in his\ncommunity supported him. The difference though at this time is that he was blending his\ntreasure hunting skills and his folk magic sensibilities\nwith this religious revival that was happening at the time to create something kind of unique. (birds chirping) So anyway, he's in his early twenties, he's translating the Book of Mormon. He faces a bunch of ups and downs, he goes through a few scribes and after a very productive 90\nday window, 24 year old, barely educated Joseph Smith\nfinishes dictating 588 pages of text that would become\nthe Book of Mormon. (birds chirping) Joseph says that he gives\nthe plates back to Moroni and then takes the manuscript\nof the pages to a printer. That's how we have the Book of Mormon. This is my Book of Mormon. Maps, my early exposure to maps. (pages turning) So the Book of Mormon is\nincredibly important to this story because it was the main\nvalidator for Joseph Smith in those early days and continues\nto be a foundational part for believers in the LDS faith. That's because Joseph Smith\nwasn't religious or educated and now suddenly he's\nwriting this Bible like book in a few months. And yes, this book is\ndefinitely full of a lot of like full blown copy and\npaste jobs from like the Bible. But there's also like a lot\nof really compelling stuff in here in terms of religious\nlessons, complex histories, nods back to like an understanding of Hebrew language and culture. This is not the type of guy\nthat his town saw him as. He was a treasure hunter and a farm kid, not a religious man, and\ndefinitely not a prophet. - [Speaker 2] Mr. Smith,\ncould you tell me more about that book? - Yes, yes, I could. - Okay, so let's be clear\non what Joseph Smith said The Book of Mormon is, it's\nnot what a lot of people say, which is like the Mormon Bible. The book tells the story of\na group of Jews in Jerusalem in around 600 BC. They're told to leave the city before it gets destroyed. So they leave the city, they\nwalk in the desert for a while, probably to like Oman is\nwhat a lot of Mormons think. And then they build a boat\nand travel across the ocean for a very long time until\nthey reach the Americas, somewhere in like North\nCentral or South America. The foundation of the story\nis about these brothers of the original family who\nlike eventually split off and they like hate each\nother and they grow up into these two different civilizations, the Nephites and the Lamanites\nwho are always fighting with each other. And there's all these prophets and there's all this drama that happens. And the introduction to\nmy Book of Mormons says, \"The Lamanites\", these people\ncame over from Jerusalem, are quote \"the principle ancestors\nof the American Indians.\" And a few years ago they did\nchange that to, \"The Lamanites being among the ancestors\nof the American Indians.\" But yeah, the point is\nthat the Book of Mormon is a history of these Jews\nturned indigenous Americans. And unsurprisingly, there's a\nwhole community of believers who work to validate that this is actually a historic record. But no, in the reality there's\nno archeological, genetic, or linguistic evidence that\nsupports the Book of Mormon's assertion that Jewish people migrated to the Americas around 600 BC. For believers, the most\nimportant part of this book is the climax of the whole thing, where in 33 AD Jesus, having\nrecently been crucified over in the old world, in Jerusalem, gets resurrected over there and comes to visit the people in America, which is where this painting came from. This is a painting that is hanging in a lot of LDS churches. It shows Jesus Christ among\nthe ancient civilizations of the Americas. Yeah, some pretty wild stories. (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) So yeah, I know we're all over the place and we'll get back to Joseph\nSmith's life for a second. But as someone who has read\nthis book dozens of times, I can tell you that\nwhen you're a believer, this is a really compelling piece of work. You can read these pages and\nyou can read about the stories and the lessons and the metaphors and you can take a lot from it. And the biggest thing that\nyou take from it is that it is proof that Joseph Smith\nwas actually called of God to prepare the world\nfor the second coming, that he was a legitimate prophet. So Joseph Smith by 1830\nhas the Book of Mormon. He has proof that he's a prophet and he starts to gain followers,\nfollowers that believe him. And a group of those followers\nget together in April of 1830 in a little house in Fayette, New York, and they start a church. At this point, Joseph Smith is behaving like a full-blown prophet. He says he's getting almost\ndaily communication from Jesus and he starts to develop a theology that is unlike anything else on offer. (light piano music) Turns out that God is actually\na man with a body of flesh and bone and he has a wife. God lives near a star that's far away. And we, all of us here on\nearth, are these little eternal balls of light\ncalled intelligences, but are heavenly parents have birthed us into spiritual children. And then they sent us down onto this earth to get a physical body, to get married, to create an earthly family,\nto learn and to grow. So that someday we can\nreturn to live with God, with our families, and then we can become\nlike God with our spouses. We can create our own spiritual families in some other part of the\nuniverse, but in order to do that, we have to pass some tests here on earth. We have to complete certain rituals and demonstrate obedience to him. And in order to make this all happen, he needs to set up a church. The church needs to have proper authority and there would need to be a savior that would come down to\naccount for all of our sins so that we can be pure to enter\nthe Kingdom of God, again. Luckily, one of our spiritual\nbrothers named Jehovah later called Jesus volunteered\nto be this savior. Okay, but there's a big problem, which is that God's children\nare super rebellious. So over the years, God calls prophets to organize his church\nwith the proper authority and to do all of these special rituals to teach them about Jesus. And eventually that truth\ngets eroded and it fades away and the world falls into\napostasy until it's ready again. When God calls another prophet\nto restore his authority and start the whole process over again, this happens over and over. Until eventually Jesus came,\nhe was like the sixth prophet. He establishes his church\ncauses prophets and apostles gives them the authority by\nputting his hands on their head. And then of course he suffers for our sins and dies on the cross. But just like has happened over and over, Jesus' church got corrupted, it got mixed with power and politics and the world fell back into the apostasy. This one's called the great apostasy. But eventually the world\nwould be coming to an end. Jesus would be coming soon and things were about to get really bad. So God helped Europeans\ncome across the ocean to take over North America, colonize the land, and create a country that had freedom of religion. Also, that a few decades later, Joseph Smith could be born and then called to restore his church. And that's how we get to the first vision. Jesus and heavenly Father\nappearing to Joseph Smith in a grove, sending angels\nto him to tell him where to get the golden plates. And to solve for the\nwhole authority thing, Joseph says that the apostles, the original apostles of\nJesus Christ came to him to restore the authority that priesthood that Jesus had given them. So now he could establish his church. There was a restoration, Joseph was the prophet of\na newly restored church that he could talk to God, he could get instruction on\nexactly how to run God's Kingdom here on earth to prepare the\nworld for the millennium. Okay, that was a lot. And lemme just say that was\na very summarized version of LDS theology. Someday I'd like to make\na video about the details because it's actually super\ncomplex and super wild. The point I'm trying to make here is that Joseph Smith's church\ndid indeed have a lot of the ingredients of the\nreligious movements of the time, last days, apocalypse preparing\nGod's Kingdom on the earth, preparing for the millennium. This was all trending at the time. This was not surprising. But a lot of this stuff was totally new, wild fringe doctrine. God has a body and a wife. This was a completely wild\nblend of Jewish mysticism, American folk magic, reincarnation, evangelical Christianity. And eventually he even woven freemasonry. A totally fresh thing. There was nothing quite like it. It was super unique and super\npotent and super polarizing. You either believed that Joseph Smith was an incredibly inspired\nprophet who was like revealing the truth that none of\nus had ever heard before, or he was just a brilliant,\ncreative visionary inventing this elaborate\nplan to dupe people, which is what a lot of\npeople in his village started to think as he\nstarted to gain followers. They had him arrested, calling\nhim a disorderly person. He eventually gets\nreleased and he realizes that he and his few members need to leave. (organ music) This begins the long journey\nof the Mormons moving west. Joseph and his followers set out. He's now talking to God\ndirectly all of the time, and he says that the Lord\nis telling him to go to Ohio to await instructions for\ntheir actual final destination, the place that they're actually\ngonna set up their new city, their millennial kingdom, this communal utopian society\nthat would be the base for preparing the world for\nthe second coming of Jesus. They would call it Zion. And this is the most important part of the entire story, Zion. If you want to understand Joseph Smith, and if you want to understand the rest of the Latter-day Saints movement, including modern Mormonism,\nyou have to understand Zion. (suspenseful music) Joseph says that the Lord is telling him that he will give him the\nexact location of Zion, and he tells him that it\nwill be quote \"On the borders by the Lamanites\". Remember that the Lamanites\nare the American Indians. And so this actually works perfectly because at this time, the U.S. government is ethnically cleansing North America and pushing first Americans west. So there's a lot of territory\nwhere white settlers are budding up against Native Americans. Zion's gonna be somewhere around here. So Joseph and his\nfollowers are now in Ohio and they are growing. People love this story. And the concept of Zion transitions\nfrom this sort of vague, idealistic idea to a very solid plan. A new society called the new Jerusalem, the new Jerusalem from\nthe prophecies of old. And it literally became a plan, like he actually starts\nto sketch it on paper. We got these digital scans of Joseph Smith's sketches of Zion. (light piano music) He writes in extreme detail on exactly what this city will be. This whole thing was based\non these gridded streets, on perfectly parceled plots, on no more than one square mile of land. Joseph writes that \"The\nhome should be 25 feet from the street to leave room\nfor a yard and plant gardens. All the houses were to be\nbrick or brick and stone, and there should be farms\nall around this city that aren't too far.\" The central streets of this\ncity nod to Joseph's love for Jewish history and culture. Zion Street, Jerusalem\nStreet, Bethlehem Street, with the temple in the center of the city. Spoiler alert, this is how Salt Lake City and a lot of cities in\nUtah are actually designed. But that's for part two. I mean, what this shows is that\nJoseph was taking this idea of God's restored kingdom on\nearth, totally, literally. And it was gonna be hyper progressive, a new communal society\nwhere everyone would share with one another, the\nresources would be shared, and the whole thing would be\ngoverned by celestial laws and governmental structures. A new government run by\nthe prophet where God could talk to his people while he prepared the world for its end. Zion was a vision that\nJoseph was uniquely good at rallying around. Charismatic and creative\nleader, prolific and inspiring. His followers became deeply dedicated to this mission of establishing Zion, and it becomes the main\ncalling card for new converts. Joseph Smith's Millennial\nKingdom is the place to be when the world ends, and the world's ending any day now. (light upbeat music) So the church is growing in Ohio. They still don't know where\nthe final location of Zion is gonna be, and meanwhile,\nJoseph is getting more and more and more of these revelations, and he's pushing the\nbelief system of Mormonism further and further from\nmainstream Christianity. Joseph comes out and says there actually is no heaven and hell, but rather there are\nthree kingdoms of heaven. All of us will be sorted\ninto these different kingdoms depending on how obedient\nwe were here on earth, how much we accepted Christ\nand repented of our sins. There's even a spiritual\nprison and paradise that you go to after you die, but before you're sorted\ninto the kingdoms. In order to get to the\nhighest degree of kingdom, the celestial kingdom, you have to be married\nby the proper authority that will seal you to you and\nyour family forever and soon. Joseph says that more\nangels are appearing to him to give him the authority\nto do this sealing thing. Family is becoming core\nto Mormon theology. But the good times don't last. The locals in Ohio and\ntheir government don't love this vision of a new religious society. The flocks of new members\nof the church arriving to this super well-organized, efficient, unified group of people led\nby this charismatic prophet who has more and more fringe beliefs. One night Joseph is violently dragged from his home by a mob. He's covered in tar and feathers. They're telling him to leave and he does. Luckily, one of Joseph's missionaries and former scribes Oliver\nCowdery had been out scouting where Zion should be, where the millennial\nkingdom should be set up. And he comes back and\nsays he found the place, Jackson County, Missouri, 800 miles away. Indeed and just as the Lord said, right on the border with the Laymanites. \"This would be Zion\",\nthe Lord tells Joseph, the place where he is appointed for the gathering of the saints. And now there's a revelation\nfrom the Lord saying that all of this land in Independence, Missouri should be\npurchased by the saints. Buy up as much land as you can. This is Zion. Oh, and it is revealed\nto Joseph that this area, Independence, Missouri,\nJackson County, Missouri, is right next to the\noriginal Garden of Eden like where Adam and Eve\nlike the first people were. It turns out that Missouri\nis like the holy land, the epicenter for the end of the world, and the Garden of Eden is in Missouri. So Mormons start buying up land and they start moving to Missouri. And they did this quickly. This wasn't theoretical. They thought that the second\ncoming was like weeks or months or just maybe a few years away. Martin Harris, one of the early converts, asserted that quote, \"In four years, every religion in the\nU.S. would be broken down and all would become Mormon, and that the rest of the\nhuman race would just perish.\" And then he was so confident that he said that \"If it didn't happen, he\nwould cut off his own hands.\" I mean, they were serious about building Zion in Missouri and quick. Okay, but not so fast. The locals like are not into this. They hear about this swarm of\nMormons coming to their county who want to turn their\ncity into a new religious, communal society and\nprepare for the apocalypse. And now they're arriving by the thousands, which means they will have\nmore political power soon. They start to get scared\nthat the Mormons are plotting a takeover of their private\nproperty all in the name of building Zion, and they're\nnot gonna stand for it. They want the Mormons out. So they start sabotaging\nthem with violence, vandalizing their stores,\ndestroying their homes, assaulting Mormon leaders. It gets really violent. And at first, Joseph tells his\nfollowers to not fight back. And once again, the\nMormons are driven out. The next five years are\nyears of conflict for Joseph and his growing church. They're on the move all over the Midwest, at each stop facing violent resistance from local residents and\ngovernment officials. So Joseph and his followers\nare done being passive. They start fighting back and it escalates into basically a full blown war. The governor of Missouri issues a literal extermination\norder saying quote, \"The Mormons must be treated as enemies and must be exterminated or driven from the state if necessary\nfor public peace.\" It's getting really bad. So they flee once more to\nIllinois where the government, who includes a young lawmaker\nnamed Abraham Lincoln, gives them a special\ncharter to create a city and a government that is fit for their unique Zion principles. They call this city Nauvoo, Hebrew for beautiful or beautiful place. (calm music) Okay, so even though the Lord\nhad said to Joseph that he had prepared Missouri to\nbe the place for Zion, the Saints were gonna have to\nsettle for Illinois for now, and they feel safe\nprotected by this charter and they start creating Zion. There's a total merger\nbetween church and state, a complete religiously run settlement where Joseph appoints himself\nto be in charge of the courts as well as the newly strengthened militia. They now have a full army\nto protect themselves. Joseph had been sending\nmissionaries to Europe to preach about the gospel and invite people to come join his vision of Zion. And one of those people is my\nlike great-great-grandfather who was converted by a\nmissionary in England and then traveled to the\nUnited States with his family and pregnant wife in\npursuit of finding Zion. And they arrived to Nauvoo,\na city that eventually grew to be more populous than Chicago. And it's in Nauvoo where Joseph says that an angel appeared to him\nand demanded, multiple times, against his will, that he\ntake on multiple wives, that those wives are sealed to him. His first plural marriage is to a teenager and he goes on to have 40\nwives in just three years. Many of them were married to other people, but then were sealed\nto Joseph the prophet. What I find striking here\nis that up until this point, you have this meticulous\ndocumentation of every single revelation and theology rule\nand new policy in the church here in what's called\nthe doctrine covenants. But polygamy stayed quiet and private. It was one of those revelations\nreserved for just Joseph and the leaders that he chose. By 1844, the Zion dream\nis actually catching fire. It's growing in Illinois, and Joseph decides to run for president. Now, he didn't have a\nbig chance of winning, but in his mind and the\nmind of his followers, this was the natural next step. They were establishing Zion, and Zion was going to be\nthe new society on earth. But this presidential\ncampaign miserably backfires because now he has seen as a\nlegitimate political threat. He's too good at gaining new followers. It gets worse when one group\nof former Latter-day Saints, who didn't agree with Joseph decide to publish a newspaper in\nNauvoo that criticized him for polygamy and generally his leadership. Joseph has done messing\naround at this point. He's become very militant, and he responds by sending his militia to destroy their printing press. He declares martial law, and\nnow the government of Illinois who had given them this\nsort of safe charter, sees this chaos and they're not into it. And they arrest Joseph for\nattempting to incite a riot. Now, this was one of\nmany run-ins with the law that Joseph Smith had didn't cover them. Some of them were legitimate, some of them were trumped up, but now he's caused a real disruption. He gets locked up in\njail and two days later, a mob of more than 200\nmen storm this jail. They climb up to the\nsecond floor where Joseph and his brother are,\nand they shoot at him. He tries to jump out the window\nand he falls to his death. The prophet is dead at 38.\n(gun shots) Joseph Smith is now a martyr. He died with a Book of\nMormon in his hands, defending his vision, his\nbelief in his own story. This poured fuel on the\nfire of his vision for Zion. But the Latter-day Saints start to realize that if they're gonna build Zion, it's not gonna be in the United States. They need to look further afoot. They need a place far\naway where they can build their millennial kingdom\nwithout being harassed for it. So you look far to the west, to Mexico, and the next chapter of the\nstory is the move into Mexico and the establishment of their Zion next to a large salty\nlake in the high desert. And that is a story I'll\ntell you in part two. But for now, I want to just tell you my thoughts on Joseph Smith. As someone who spent most of\nmy life believing this story, basing my life and my worldview around it, doing this story and looking\nat it from an objective historical lens has taught me a lot. Joseph Smith created\nsomething really powerful. You can't deny that. It was a story about the last days. It was a story full of\ntreasure and visions and angels and modern day revelation from God. It was a story about a chosen people, a utopian society of one heart and one mind, safety, enlightenment. There's a reason why every year, Latter-day Saints go back to\nthat hill in upstate New York where Joseph said he found the plates and they put on this\ninsanely ambitious production on a stage that's like 10 levels deep with almost a thousand\ncharacters where they reenact the story of Joseph Smith, their prophet. They reenact him finding the\nplates, translating them, and then they act out the\nstory of the Book of Mormon. There's a reason why Latter-day\nSaints sing a song called, \"Praise to the Man\", where\nthey laud Joseph Smith, the prophet who opened\nthe last dispensation, who restored the truth to the world. \u266a Jesus anointed the prophet \u266a I believed this. I believed this well into my twenties. I found deep comfort in it. I found community in\nbeing a part of a religion that was so different\nthan every other religion, and that was very often mocked for it. The martyrdom and the\npersecution of Joseph and his followers became\nproof that this was true and that it was being\npersecuted in these last days, just like the prophecies\nin the Bible told us about. And I was compelled by\nthis idea of the last days. The problem with getting\ncaught up in the beauty and the comfort, and the\nnarrative of being a chosen people in the last days is that\nit allows you to ignore. I think that's what a lot\nof people have done over the decades with Joseph's story. They ignore, they ignore something that I guess is plain for me to see now, on the other side of this. (light piano music) Brother, I am happy, happy man. I've been for more than a missionary for more than a year now, I can relax. Joseph Smith was a charismatic\nleader who knew how to tell stories about\nmagic, about visions, and about treasure. He had known how to do that\nsince he was a teenager. Well before he decided he was\ngoing to become a prophet. He found an audience in doing this. He attracted people to him\nwith his visionary skills, and he used those skills to\ninvent a complex set of stories about Native Americans\nactually being Israelites, about heavenly parents,\npreparing the world for its end and about the priesthood, this authority that we all\nmust participate in to receive the rituals and ordinances that only one church can administer. And eventually, he used these\nstories to build a movement around his vision that\nallowed him to take 40 wives and build an army and break\nlaws and bully his enemies. When you are a Latter-day Saint, these facts are written off as anti-Mormon literature or persecution. But for me, having left\nthe church and spent years rewiring my brain and my\nprogramming of these stories, I see them as facts. And frankly, they're not that surprising. This is the same old story of\na charismatic, visionary man who tells a story of apocalyptic endings to gain followers, to gain power, and then decides that he\ndeserves a lot of women, and then he dies for the cause, leaving a movement that\ncontinues his vision. Oftentimes those movements\nget more and more dogmatic. They use shame to keep\ntheir people close to them, and they revere their prophet long after that prophet is dead. And yet, what's complicated\nabout this is I can't help, but feel a deep sense of sadness\nfor having lost my belief in Joseph's story. I can't explain it, but these stories are\nincredibly comforting when you believe in\nthem, they're motivating. These creative stories unlike\nany other belief system can be really beautiful. And that is a paradox that\nthere's really no resolution for. There's a lot more to say on this, but I'm gonna save it for\npart two on the series where we see what happens\nnext after Joseph is murdered and the Latter-day Saints move west to find their vision of Zion, okay. (birds chirping) (light calm music) Okay, well, thanks for watching. And if you're still here, I know that was a bit of\na emotional rollercoaster there at the end, especially if you are\nsomeone who was associated with the church in any way. And there's a lot there. And I know in making this video, I felt a lot of feelings and\nrehashed a lot of things, but I think doing it, telling this story has been\npretty cathartic for me, and I'm really looking\nforward to the discussion in the comments about what\nothers feel about this stuff. Let me tell you about a couple things. Number one, I'm really grateful\nfor those who support us over at The Newsroom. The Newsroom is what we call our Patreon. It is a community of people who support the independent journalism\nwe're doing here on the channel. Newsroom members get an\nextra video every month. It's a vlog that is a\nbehind the scenes look at what it's like to be here in\nthe studio with us running this independent journalism\nstudio on YouTube, which is a fun experiment. You meet the people behind the scenes, you see our processes,\nyou see our shenanigans. It's a good time. You also get access to my\nscripts and some music. But most importantly, the people who are there are mostly there because they believe in what we're doing and they wanna support, which is awesome. Also, I'm really into maps, which is not new to many of you. I designed a poster that\nyou can have on your wall. It is called \"All Maps Are Wrong\", and it displays like 96\ndifferent map projections, the different ways that you\ncan show our spherical globe on a flat plane. So that is for sale. I think we sold out, but I think we've ordered a new batch. So that should be for sale. I hope it's for sale, I\nhope it's not sold out. If you're like a video photo person, we have LUTs and presets, which are just ways to color\nyour photos or your videos the way that we color\nour photos and videos. We develop these with a\nprofessional colorist. They reflect kind of our look and feel. You can buy those and support\nthe channel and use them. At the end of the day, you\nbeing here, commenting, showing your support, showing your love, watching these videos is the best way that you can support us. So I appreciate you being here, and we're just gonna keep\nmaking lots of videos. Thanks for being here. Talk to you later, bye. Okay, we did it, dude. (light upbeat music)"

    "captions": "- [Johnny] The world is\nchanging and it's changing fast. We're exiting a period\nof incredible growth and relative stability, where\nafter the most destructive war in human history, the US rose\nto power as the global leader. - The American people\nin their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. - [Johnny] And as that leader, the US created new structures like NATO and the World Trade Organization,\nthey established rules, rules about trade, rules about economics, rules about justice, rules that they based on Western philosophical\nvalues now being projected around the globe by a country\nwith an astounding amount of alliances and military hardware. (tense music) For a time, another great\nempire challenged that order, operating with a different set of rules, a different set of values\nand philosophies, trading with their own block and working\nwith their own alliances. But it couldn't last. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the '90s left the US\nand their rich allies as the soul setters of the\nrules, the holders of the power. So the US doubled down and their system of\nliberal values, democracy and free trade spread and\nfortified throughout the world. But when you're the global leader, when you're the one\nwho sets all the rules, you get to decide when\nyou follow your own rules and when you don't. Being the global\nsuperpower has turned more into being the global policeman. Over these last 75 years, the US has been known to\nviolate the values, norms and ideals that it built the\nwhole global system off of, cozying up to strongman dictators, throwing out democratically\nelected governments, fueling regional wars and generally trying to stamp out communism across the globe. And anyone who didn't wanna\nplay by America's rules was cast out as an insane\npariah in need of regime change. - The Iraqi regime has\nplotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear\nweapons for over a decade. - And yet, despite this\ndouble game the US has played, this system has been a part of the most peaceful\nperiod of human history. Major empires don't fight\neach other like they used to. And a major reason is because\nthey came to understand that getting in line with\nthe American-led system would mean economic\nopportunity and growth. It wasn't worth a war. Fighting against this system\noften meant destruction and losing deals for all sides. This piece was also helped by the existence of the most\npowerful weapons ever invented, which great powers didn't\ndare use on each other. (air whooshing) The American led system\nhas meant stability and an incredible amount of trade leading to a dramatic reduction in global poverty. But that era is coming to an end. Hey, it's me not in the\nVO booth, here on camera so I can just tell you about something. I'm not sure if you've heard that the goal of this channel\nis kind of developing, let's say, we want to become the place for rigorous independent journalism on the internet and on YouTube. And we're doing that not\njust here on the channel but we just launched a new\nchannel called Search Party with my old Vox colleague, Sam Ellis. It's live now. If you're looking for ways\nto support this journalism and get something in return,\nI've got a fun one for you. Consider subscribing to Nebula.

And for the rest of you, let's\ndive back into the globe. In part, thanks to the\nUS led order, China, which until recently was the\nmost populous country on earth, has risen to become the\nsecond largest economy and world's largest military\nbased on active forces. And more and more, China sees the US as an unfair policeman of the\nglobal order, only holding to the rules that benefit them\nand this projection of values and philosophies from the\nWest to the leaders in China, this looks a lot like the modern\nday version of colonialism. They see this hypocritical\nAmerican empire drunk on power that they've had since 1945, an America that is increasingly defensive because it's in decline\nwith its broken politics, divided people and a complacency\nwith their spot at the top. So China is building a competing system. In March, 2023, China's leader Xi Jinping announced his Global Civilization\nInitiative where he stated that countries must quote, \"Refrain \"from imposing their own\nvalues or models on others \"and refrain from stoking\nideological confrontation.\" So instead of the hypocritical colonialism of the US imposing their human rights and democracy around the world, his system would be transactional,\nstripping away the veil of what he views as a\nhypocritical rules-based order that is built to basically\nbenefit one group. The Chinese system would be built on common interests, beneficial deals and opportunistic alliances, not purported philosophical values. And unlike decades past,\nChina now has the military and the money to make it\nhappen, to ignore the rules of the global superpower\nand to make their own, to engage with the\nworld in a different way to pursue Chinese interests\noutside of the system. And so now you see a competition between these two great powers that have become deeply\neconomically entwined over the last 50 years and now they're slowly decoupling. And around the world, you\nsee China planting seeds for its new system,\nusing state backed money to invest in infrastructure\nprojects all over the globe. This gives China a presence\nin many new countries, tying these countries to Chinese debt, which often translates\ninto future leverage. In March, 2023, China sent\ndiplomats to the Middle East for the first major effort\nto broker a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and\nIran, these two bitter rivals. This is something that the US couldn't do and it showed the declining influence that the US has on this region, but the US still remains on top and they will as long as\nthey can control the economic and financial systems that\nthe world operates on, which they do for now. But China is challenging this\nas well, working with Brazil, Russia, India, and South\nAfrica, or the BRICS countries, to develop an alternative economic block. These are all major growing economies and they will only become more important in the next two decades. Since 2009, the BRICS countries have been stepping up their\ncooperation, meeting annually, creating a new development bank\nto invest in their countries and coordinating on various policies. The BRICS countries are\nbecoming a potential rival to the G7 countries, which\nrepresent the US led order. BRICS countries are even discussing creating their own currency that they share between\nthese five growing economies. - They're creating a a secondary economy in the world totally independent\nof the United States. We won't have to talk about\nsanctions in five years because there'll be so\nmany countries transacting in currencies other than the dollar that we won't have the\nability to sanction them. - [Johnny] This would be a\nmajor challenge to the US dollar which is currently the standard\nfor international trade and a major reason why everyone has to play nice with the US. Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a major pushback\nagainst the Western security and economic order and it showed us which countries will fall on\nwhich side of that divide. You can see that most countries\naren't taking a side here. They aren't siding with Russia and China or with the Western block. You could call these the\nnon-aligned countries, the undecided, the countries that China and the US will be looking to influence into their system in coming years. Let's highlight the 25 largest economies among these non-aligned countries, at least according to the\nEconomist Intelligence Unit. These are the economies that the US is working to keep on their\nside, to keep in their system, and that China is trying to woo to join their new transactional system. But this Cold War is\ndifferent than the last one, the one where the USA and the\nSoviet Union forced countries to deeply choose aside based\non ideological convictions about capitalism versus communism. This new rising Cold War could\nbe much less black and white. Instead, in this much more globalized and interconnected world, non-aligned countries will\nexploit this bidding war between the superpowers\nto get them the best trade and security deals possible, like in Brazil where this\nis already happening. Brazil is a massive country who is a super close ally\nwith the United States and yet they're a part of\nthe BRICS block with China, which is one reason Brazil\nrefused to sell weapons to Ukraine when the\ncountry requested a deal. They're already walking this line between their interests\nthat align with the US order and their interests that align with China. Brazil's president traveled\nto Beijing in April, 2023 and not only did the\nBrazilian president sign around 20 new agreements on technology, trade and agriculture but\nhe actually asked Beijing to help him negotiate the war in Ukraine. So even as the US and China cut ties, Brazil is showing that\nthey're not gonna take a side, they're gonna play both\nsides to their own benefit. India is kind of doing the\nsame thing, getting lots of cheap oil and nearly half\nof their weapons from Russia and then getting a\nquarter of their weapons from Europe and recently\nsecuring $200 billion in funding from the US for\nIndian technology startups. Saudi Arabia gets almost all of its weapons from the United States but is turning away from the\nUS in other ways like trade, where China is now their\ntop trading partner. In late 2022, China and Saudi Arabia signed a\nstrategic partnership agreement, meaning that their leaders will\nbe meeting more frequently, there will be more trade,\nmore technology transfer and more diplomacy. Turkey is a member of\nNATO and generally aligned with the West, but also has\nto walk a fine line here because it has strong\neconomic ties to Russia. Turkey also doesn't wanna lose out on China's economic expansion. China has this Belt and Road Initiative that runs right through Turkey and they're hoping to court\nmore Chinese investment in transportation, energy and mining. Pakistan is a country\nthat has been aligned with the US in recent years and a partner on the war and terror but it also entertains\ninvestment and trade with China, including a $62 billion investment from China's Belt and Road Initiative to create this economic corridor\nbetween the two countries. The continent of Africa is full of mostly non-aligned countries. It's also where China has\nbeen busy giving huge loans and building bridges,\nports, mines and railways, all with the goal of tying these countries to the future Chinese way of doing things. And China is expanding trade here too, trading $254 billion with Africa in 2021 while the US only traded $44 billion, a sixth the amount of China. China's investment has been swift and effective here and all over the globe in garnering new friends and\nallies, laying the foundation for their competing world order. But the US isn't just gonna\nsit back and let this happen. They're already responding. Big names like Kamala\nHarris, the vice president, or Janet Yellen, the head\nof the Federal Reserve, Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State have all visited Africa in 2023. President Biden went to\nSaudi Arabia last year despite calling the country\na quote, \"Pariah state,\" on the campaign trail. He was there to try to\nclaw back some influence that was being taken by China. And then of course, the US is hitting China straight\non, cutting them off from Western technology\nto hamper their economic and military progress. The US and its allies in Asia\nare also encircling China with their military in the Pacific, sending billions of dollars of weapons and infrastructure\ninto China's backyard. So it looks like we're in the early days of a new multipolar world, a competition between a great superpower\nand a rising superpower that wants to lead a new system\nbased on different values. The result is likely the undoing of a lot of the globalization and interconnectedness that has developed in the last 70 years. And for now, I think what we'll see is countries won't be\nchoosing a side hastily. Instead, they'll play both\nof these great powers off of each other to get the\nbest deal for their country. I'm not sure how long they'll be able to do this as tensions rise and the pressure mounts to choose a side. But for now, what's clear is that we're moving\ninto uncharted waters.

    "title": "I\u2019m starting a new channel",
    "video_id": "h3-gWNwEaYA",
    "captions": "(clicking)\n(suspenseful music) - I want you to see something. Okay, I'm just gonna go ahead and say it for anyone who\njust wants the quick version. I started a new channel\nwith my old Vox colleague Sam Ellis, the creator of Vox Atlas. It is live. Now it is called Search Party. It's going to be amazing. You can go watch it. For those who wanna stick\naround, let me explain. I mean, how did we get here? So three years ago, I left the\nnews outlet that birthed me as a journalist to try to figure out what independent journalism felt like. I'm in Mexico now. And it's been quite the ride. Can I get an ice cream cone? (upbeat music) This airport is completely empty. (upbeat music) I didn't expect it to\ngo the way that it has and I didn't expect to\nfind an audience who was so eager to experiment with me on what journalism could be\nand how it could be different. (upbeat music) Wow. I'm really amazed at the\naudience who has stuck with us during all of these years as this channel has grown\nand here behind the scenes, I'm even more amazed at\nthe creative, talented, committed people who make\nthis all happen on our team. (upbeat music) There tends to be so much doom\nand gloom about the future of news and journalism, and yet that's not the future I see. Every week I share a video\nwith you and what I see is a huge community of millions\nof people who want to learn, who are interested in facts and truth and evidence. So I guess what I'm saying\nis I see a world where more and more news and journalism happens here with independent journalists like myself who want to continue to create work that maintains journalistic rigor, but want to do that journalism in a place where they can have a more\npersonal back and forth with their audience. This is not happening. What I like about this\nsetup is that it requires me to earn your trust. To be transparent about how I\ndo my work and what it allows for is really exciting. It allows me to get your\nthoughts, your voices, your feedback on my stories,\neverything from voting on the titles and thumbnails,\nwhich a lot of you do in the community tab to\nhelping critique my work so that it's more accurate\nin a world that is becoming increasingly polarized. I believe there is value in\naudiences being able to turn to independent journalists\nwho aren't beholden to the profit incentives\nof large media companies. I need to show you a video\nthat is blowing my mind. But wait, there's a problem kind of with this whole\nindependent journalism thing which is that the biggest\nthing that you lose in going independent is colleagues Other journalists who will\nhelp make your work better. A story editor, just people\nto look over your scripts. It's a major drawback to\nnot being at a news outlet and it's one of the main\nreasons I still do work with like the New York Times\nso that I can get that feedback from more seasoned journalists. But that is a problem that\nwe're trying to solve. Over these years is has worked\nreally hard to build a team. She's hired, she's\nsystematized, she's managed. The result of all of this\nis now we have a big team of creative, talented\npeople who share this vision of rigorous journalism on YouTube. And to be clear, this team is\nthe only reason we are able to make these super long\nin-depth videos every week for all of you. I'm honestly kind of blown away that it all happens, but it somehow does. This is getting absurd. I cannot believe we're even\nhaving this conversation. So in short, we've built an\nindependent journalism studio that can be simultaneously\ninvestigating labor abuses in Qatar as well as watching\nhours of North Korean cinema or scouring financial\ndisclosures of American lawmakers while still allowing me to\ngo to the Swiss Alps to look for military bunkers or in\nbed with remote communities in northern Greenland. Putting on the heavy duty stuff here 'cause we're just out\nhere on the ice all day and it gets cold. (speaks in foreign language) And now I'm getting to the\npoint of this whole video which is to tell you that we're\ntaking the next step forward on our mission to become the home of the best independent video\njournalism on the internet. Let me introduce you to Sam Ellis. - Hey, I'm Sam Ellis. - I mean if you want to know Sam just look at his work at Vox. Sam and I work together\nat Vox for many years. He's a journalist, he's a writer, editor, designer, animator and the creator of Vox Atlas. A show that has brought\ninternational issues to millions of people\nfor the last five years. And all of that is in addition to the Emmy nominated work\nthat he's done on Vox Explained as well as Vox show level\nplaying field on HBO. He has a lot of experience. He's well-sourced, he's deeply committed to journalistic rigor and accuracy. So me, Sam, (indistinct) have been talking and talking and dreaming and thinking. And the result is what\nwe're launching today. (gentle music) This is Search Party. Search Party is a new independent\nvideo journalism channel that is dedicated to uncovering, decoding and telling the\nmost important stories in geopolitics and global sports. Yes, I said sports. Sam, in addition, to being a foreign affairs\nreporter, is a giant sports fan. His work on search party\nwill use his unique visual style to explore\nthe geopolitical stories of the day, military,\neconomics, diplomacy, but then will also apply that same lens to global sports from serious corruption and policy matters within sports. To coverage on how\nsports relates to culture and history and identity. Sam's videos on Search Party will look and feel somewhat similar to\nwhat you see on this channel. After all, our separate journeys in journalism have had\na lot of similarities. We were shaped by video\njournalism on the internet. We were taught by some of the\nbest new media journalists at Vox and we're committed\nto the same principles of rigorous reporting and\nbeautiful presentation. You'll even hear Tom Fox\nmusic and see beautiful maps and we might even collaborate\nfrom time to time. And yet Search Party\nvideos will be different. They will feel like nothing\nelse that exists right now. They'll be quite shorter than mine. And you'll see very quickly that Sam doesn't appear on camera much. He works more behind the scenes. His videos will be much\nmore concise and focused and efficient on giving\nyou the best understanding of complex topics in a\nshort amount of time. If you've ever watched Vox\nAtlas, which you should if you haven't, you'll see\nthat Sam literally obsesses over unlocking the path to deep\nunderstanding of big issues. He whittles down topics\nto find the essence of the explanation,\nand then he presents it to you in the most beautiful way possible. So Search Party is live. Right now, the first video's\nup, it's really good. I helped work on it. And if some of you are wondering\nhow you can support this, here are a few ways. Number one, if you feel\nexcited about this big step in independent journalism that\nwe are taking, tell people about it, post about it,\nshare about it, whatever. The way our algorithmic\ndriven world works is the more people are talking\nabout stuff, the better it does. Secondly, you should go over and subscribe and watch these videos. Don't subscribe if you're not gonna watch\nthat could do terrible things to the algorithm. But if you are interested\nin this, go subscribe, get notified and click on\nthe video when it comes out. That is literally the lifeblood\nof how our business works. And finally, in these early days, we don't have a lot of revenue coming in. We're looking for sponsors. We're maybe looking for grants, but if you want to be a supporter, we are gonna have a membership\nprogram for Search Party. Anyone who supports Search\nParty will get a badge saying how long they've been\nsupporting Search Party. That badge will stick with you in the comments and it will show that you are someone who\nwants to support this project who wants to support good factual, authoritative journalism on YouTube. And lastly, give us story ideas. Go over to Search Party and comment what story\nyou want to see next. Up vote story ideas that\nyou find interesting. We want to build Search Party as something that the audience wants and that the audience helps craft. That's how I've always done it. That's how I know how to do it. That's what I think you want. That's how Search Party is gonna be built. On that note, I will see some\nof you in tomorrow's video about the new Cold War,\nthis video we've worked on for a really long time\nand it comes out tomorrow. I hope you like it and I'll see others of\nyou over on Search Party. See you later. (gentle music)"

    "captions": "- I wanna show you two video clips. One of them is real and\none of them is fake. Can you tell which one's real? Okay. This one was kind of easy. Obviously this is the fake one. Like you can see the color on\nthe face isn't quite right, and the hair is obviously like a wig. But this video was like\nfrom a few years ago. Let's look at a more recent example. Look at these two clips. One of them is real,\nand one of them is fake. Can you tell which one it is? Okay, what about these? Or these? Which one of these is fake,\nand which one of these is real? Maybe you're some wizard and\nyou could tell, but I couldn't. And my guess is that most people can't. That's because things have changed. - I've never seen it quite like this. - [Woman] This technology\nis spreading rapidly. - It's really extreme.\n- Mind blowing. - Deepfakes. - Deepfakes. - [Man] Deep Tom Cruise was a\ntipping point for deepfakes. - It's all real. - In the last few years,\nwe've crossed a threshold, into a world where moving\nimages are manipulated in ways that make them\nindistinguishable from reality. This is our new world. It is the world of high quality deepfakes. - The catastrophic\npotential to public trust, and to markets, that could\ncome from deepfake attacks. - This is happening quicker than any of us could have imagined. So I wanna get you up to speed on what's happening with deepfakes, how they're revolutionizing entertainment. - It's all my fault. (speaks foreign language) - [Johnny] And creating\nnew challenges and fears for the people who make our laws, and the people who enforce those laws. - They can make it look like anyone is saying anything\nat any point in time. - Ultimately, I wanna show\nyou how much of a threat deepfakes actually pose, and answer the biggest question of all. What is even real? Seeing is not believing anymore. Okay, it's actually me. This is the real Johnny. I promise this is not a deepfake. I promise! I'm not like gonna do like\nsome little bait and switch. I need to tell you about the\nsponsor of today's video, which is a thing I'm really excited about. I'm genuinely excited! Not just because they're\nsupporting the channel, but because I'm actually excited! For years now, I have been in\na war with marketing people. Secretive, shadowy marketing people who collect all of my\ndata, put it on lists, lots of lists, and then\nsell it to corporations who then flood my inbox and my\nphone and my life, with spam. Lots of spam. This ends up creating a\nlot of noise in my life, a lot of noise that I don't want. And it has been impossible for me to actually get myself off these lists, until Incogni came around. What many of us don't know is that we actually have legal protections against our data being bought and sold, and these predatory marketing practices coming to bear on us all of the time. But it is a very complicated\nand time intensive process to actually implement those rights. With Incogni, you can get\nyour name off of these lists. The creepiest part about\nthis whole industry is that there are people\nsearch websites now, where random people can just look you up and learn a bunch of stuff about you. Incogni targets those as well. It's so satisfying, because\nthey show you a dashboard of all of like, the marketing\nlists that they're working on, to take your name off of. So you get to see your\nname being taken off of all of these lists that you\ndidn't even know you were on. So, I'm signed up for the yearly plan, which means Incogni is\nconstantly monitoring month after month, to\nkeep me off these lists. And I'm already seeing the results. I'm very very happy that Incogni exists, which is why I'm so giddy right now. There's a link in my description. It's incogni.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport the channel. It also gets you in on\nthis amazing service. You can sign up and\nhave 30 days risk free, where you can get all your money back if you feel like it's not useful to you. 30 days. Use the link, go sign up. Thank you Incogni, for\nsponsoring today's video. Let's dive back into the wild,\nweird world of deepfakes. Okay, let's just be clear. We've been faking the moving\nimage for at least 100 years. - [Man] America goes to war! - Thomas Edison wanted to\nspice up his news reporting from the front lines of\nthe Spanish American War back in like, the end of the 1800s. So to do this, he shot\nsome fake battle scenes in New Jersey, and then cut them together\nwith shots from Cuba, making this look like it\nwas happening in Cuba, and it wasn't. And for the next 100 years, motion picture manipulation\nremained as crude and simplistic as Edison's sneaky editing. But then suddenly, in 2014, with the invention of a new type of AI, everything started to change. - [Man] Incredibly realistic\nso-called deepfakes. - How similar it is. Is there a way to know when this is fake, and to tell when it's fake? - We now have the ability to make people look like other people. Like, I could be Johnny, or I could be Nick, the studio manager. Look, I'm Nick the\nstudio manager right now. I could also be Tom, the music composer. And what's crazy is even\nif you go back and watch what I just showed you frame by frame, you likely won't be able to tell. Let me explain how on earth we did this. We can do all of this because of this clever computing process. It's called Generative\nAdversarial Networks, or GANS. This is where two AIs work in tandem, to get the best fake image possible. So you have these two AIs. One of them is a forger, and\nthe other is a detective. The forger creates an image based on what you ask it to make, and then it shows that image\nto the other AI, the detective. The detective goes over the image, and points out all of\nthe reasons it's fake. It knows what to look for, because it's been trained on hundreds, sometimes thousands of images of exactly what the finished products are supposed to look like. The forger is like, okay, cool. Let me try again. And it goes away and\nit makes another image, fixing the pixels that the\ndetective AI pointed out. Then it shows it to the detective. The detective AI once again points out all of the weaknesses in the fake image, and the forger goes back\nand makes a new one. And over and over and over again. And so the longer you give one of these AI models to train on, it basically goes through this creation and improvement cycle, over and over, until you get the best deepfake possible. There are many ways to train a deepfake, but this is the most common, and it's actually how we got the deepfake that we're running on this clip right now. My face is slowly morphing\ninto something else, and it's basically pixel perfect. We had to run a training model\non this face for two weeks. But it got really good. Look. It's like, amazing. I'm not me. I mean I am me. But I'm not me to you. And that's kind of nuts. - We're about to enter a brave new world. - It scares me, it really does. It scares me. - An important point here is that, we used to have to train these models on huge amounts of data. You need a lot of footage\nfrom someone's face to train these models. Which is why it's mostly\nworked on like, actors, who have a lot of high\nquality face data available. It's how you get deepfakes like this. - Do you like what you're seeing? Just wait till what's coming next. - [Johnny] Or how you get Jim Carrey imposed onto Jack Nicholson's\nface in The Shining. - I'm not gonna hurt you. - [Johnny] Or Willem Dafoe\nin Silence of the Lambs instead of Anthony Hopkins. - You look like a rube. - These last two clips were done by a super talented deepfake artist named Control Shift Face. And he's actually the one who's doing the deep\nfakes for this video too. He's the artist behind\nthat video that went super viral a few years ago, of Bill Hader doing an Arnold\nSchwarzenegger impression, and turning into Arnold Schwarzenegger. - Get out of there! There's a bomb in there! Get out! - And he's now working at a\ndeepfake production company called Deep Voodoo, where he worked on that\nKendrick Lamar video. Yes, that Kendrick Lamar video. - For me personally, it's exciting because I can like do this goofy, funny movie remixes\nthat I can put on YouTube. I really enjoy that. - And yes, when I was talking\nto him in our interview, he was using a live deep fake mask and changing between different characters, and it kind of blew my mind. Oh my god, I'm sorry. He just changed, you just\nchanged to Mark Zuckerberg. - I've got lots of faces\nup my sleeves here. - Oh my god! Wow, I did not, I was not ready for that. Deepfaking has already started to shape the entertainment industry. (upbeat music) Filmmakers are using deepfake technology to translate films into other languages. - And it's all my fault! (speaks foreign language) - They can de-age celebrities. - I (indistinct) went anywhere. - Yeah, and we're back! - There's a six part TV show in the UK about a bunch of rowdy\nneighbors, and guess what? All of these characters are\nall deepfaked celebrities. - I did move some of Kim's things. I'm sorry about that. - Two years ago, if someone\ntold me something like this would exist, I don't\nthink I would believe him. And what will be next in like, another two, three, five years? - It's getting to the\npoint where deepfakes are nearly impossible to\ndecipher as computer generated, which is super exciting,\nbut also kind of scary. - [Man] The FBI tells NBC news they're following the rapidly\ndeveloping technology closely. - I believe that this is the next wave of attacks against America. - It's a real concern. It's a real concern. (dark electronic music) - And this is where we talk\nabout the doom and gloom part. And for that, yes, I have a lot of paper. (dramatic music) Lawmakers and law enforcement are getting worried about this technology. Here's a letter from Congress, to the director of National Intelligence, raising the alarm that, \"Hyper-realistic digital forgeries, popularly referred to as deepfakes, use sophisticated machine\nlearning techniques to produce convincing depictions of individuals doing or saying\nthings that they never did.\" I kind of love when Congress\ntalks about technology. And this is the most important line. \"By blurring the line\nbetween fact and fiction, deepfake technology could\nundermine public trust in recorded images and video as objective depictions of reality.\" Oh, and by the way, this\nletter was back in 2018. Basically the Stone Age\nfor AI image generation. More recently, I saw a Democratic senator giving his opening remarks\nto his colleagues in Congress via a deepfaked voice that\nsounded perfectly like him. - [Man] We have seen what happens when technology outpaces regulation. - But it's not just American lawmakers. (dark music) Europol, which is the European\nInternational Police Agency, says that experts estimate that as much as 90% of online content may\nbe synthetically generated by 2026. 90%. Meaning AI will be\nmaking most of the stuff that we watch on the internet. Their big fear in all of this is that deepfakes will, quote, \"lead to a situation where citizens no longer have a shared reality,\" causing what they call (deep voice) an information apocalypse. (normal voice) Here is a 43 page report from the US Department\nof Homeland Security, and look at this title page! I mean, look at that graphic design! Especially this moment, where it goes from a classic\nsans serif, to a serif. I mean, it's not bad for the government. DHS says that deepfakes and\nthe misuse of synthetic content pose a clear, present, and\nevolving threat to the public, across national security, law enforcement, financial, and societal domains. The Pentagon is using\nits big research wing, the one that helped invent, I don't know, the GPS, the COVID vaccine,\nand the literal internet. That one. To look into deepfakes,\nand how to combat them. Like, they're taking this very seriously. But my big problem with\nall of these reports is, they're couched in such vague language! What can deepfakes actually be used for, outside of making really cool\nKendrick Lamar music videos and TikTok Tom Cruises? - I think there's bubble gum inside this. (electronic whirring) - Well, to get a taste, look\nno further than Ukraine. - The Russian president\nsays a military operation is now underway in eastern Ukraine. - [Woman] A column of Russian armor crossing into Ukrainian\nterritory from the north. (speaks foreign language) - This is not Ukrainian\npresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This is a deepfaked video that appeared on a Russian\nlanguage Ukrainian news site just four weeks after\nRussia invaded Ukraine. Russian troops were\ntrying to take over Kiev, which would've meant a\nmassive victory for Putin. Information on the ground\nwas scant and foggy, and this video pops up, of Volodymyr Zelenskyy urging his troops to surrender to Russian forces. Now listen, this is kind of a\ncrappy version of a deepfake. I mean, misshapen head,\nweird accent and voice. Wasn't super pulled off. But guess what? It doesn't matter, because\nwhat this video did do is it made people\nquestion every other video coming out of Ukraine. And this is what Congress meant when they were freaking out in 2018 about the idea of\ndeepfakes blurring the line between fact and fiction, undermining trust in\nrecorded images and videos as objective depictions of reality. And this is actually, so\nfar in my reporting on this, the biggest takeaway. I don't know if we realize\nwhat a big shift this is! As deepfake technology gets better, yes, it allows people to create\ncompelling fake evidence, and that is worrisome. But it also allows people\nto dismiss real evidence, real footage, as, \"Oh, that's just a deepfake. We can do that now. We\ncan't trust anything.\" - It's not just what they could create. It's the doubt that is cast\non authentic video and audio. - Yeah. - Okay, let's get to another\nconcrete threat here, to get us away from all the vague language of government agencies talking\nabout how scary this all is. Think about the legal system. (electronic whirring) Deepfakes are becoming a\nnightmare for evidence in court. In 2020, there was a child custody case, where the mother presented as evidence audio recording of the child's father saying violent things over the phone. It was submitted as legit evidence, as proof to be like, \"This\ndad is unfit to have the kid.\" But after some digital forensics, it became clear that the mother\nhad used an online tutorial and some cheap software\nto doctor the audio file, to add in fake violent words. Most judges and juries\nare not ready for this! Most wouldn't think to\nquestion evidence like this that sounds like a smoking\ngun, and yet was totally fake. This sort of technology\nis getting so accessible and easy to use. In fact, this VO that you're\nlistening to right now is actually fake. I made it using a cheap and easy software widely available to anyone. Now imagine that you're on a jury, and you're presiding over a criminal case. And even though there may not be any manipulated evidence in front of you, there's now a nagging voice in the back of your mind, that's like, \"Remember that time that Johnny tricked me in that YouTube video, and\nhe made his face change, and now he looks like someone else, and it wasn't really him, and it was really convincing? Who's to say all of this visual evidence that I'm seeing in court isn't also fake?\" Visual evidence is no longer rock solid. Surveillance footage, body cam footage, heck, even audio taken in a bus from a presidential candidate. This was all solid at one point, and now it can all be\ncalled into question. (electronic whirring) And then of course, deepfakes are being used for good old fashioned cyber crime. Man, cyber crime! It just sounds so quaint. Cyber crime. Elon Musk was recently faked to help shill a new crypto scam. - (indistinct), a site that\nwill help ordinary people to gain financial independence. - And yeah, this one's\nobviously fake and poorly done. My point is they're getting better, and some scams are already\nway more persuasive. Like this group of fraudsters who were able to clone the\nvoice of a major bank director, and then use it to steal $35\nmillion in cold hard cash, $35 million! - [Man] That's a lot of money. - Just by deepfaking this guy's voice, and like, using it to make a phone call to transfer a bunch of money. And it worked! Okay, but in reality, the risk of eroding trust in the public or weakening our legal system or giving cyber criminals a new weapon, all of these are actually\nthe rarest uses of deepfakes. The main victims of this new technology, at least at the moment, are women. - [Man] These sexually suggestive\nads are popping up online. - Sexual misuse of these deepfakes. - She's been deepfaked. - [Woman] That's not me. - By one estimate, 96%\nof deepfake production is used to produce porn. Almost all of which are using women who have not consented to this. Just two years ago,\nTelegram got in trouble, because it was found that they had private groups on their service that were using deepfake technology to remove the clothes of more\nthan a hundred thousand women. It used to just be the\nfaces of celebrities, because they're the ones who have all this high quality data out in the world that you can train a model on. But no longer. The tech has developed such that an ordinary person with a\nfew images on social media could suddenly have their faces deepfaked onto the body of a porn star. - [Man] Martin has found dozens of doctored images and videos of herself. She has no idea who's\nresponsible for them. - Okay, but what's being done about this? What can be done? Let's first remember that when\na new technology comes along, it typically evolves rapidly, way faster than the lawmakers who need to understand\nit to regulate it do. So, we're in the kind of wild west phase, where the lawmakers\nare kind of just trying to get their head around this stuff. - Let's hope that Congress can catch up. - China is actually the first\ncountry to have regulated what they call deep\nsynthesis technologies, by requiring all deepfake content to be clearly marked as\nhaving been modified. Luckily, a surveillance\nstate is a lot easier to regulate this kind of stuff. But the EU is trying. - [Woman] In an ambitious\nbill called the AI Act. - Boy do I love going through European Commission PowerPoint slides. Like China, the EU is trying to make it so that you have to label deepfakes. But of course, in a Western democracy, you have to put this line, \"unless necessary for the exercise of a fundamental right or freedom, or for reasons of public interest.\" Oh man, those pesky rights\nalways getting in the way of being able to regulate stuff. The UK is also trying to figure this out. They are targeting the porn situation, the one that is the mass majority\nof the uses of deepfakes. Doing deepfake porn without consent comes with a penalty of prison, though it's super hard\nto enforce this stuff. That's what's so tricky. But they're trying. - Will the government take urgent action and repair this mess? - And then there's tech\ncompanies, like here on YouTube. They say that they will pull\ndown any video that, quote, \"Includes deceptive uses\nof manipulated media, ie. deepfakes, which may\npose serious risk of harm.\" Who decides what serious risk of harm is? Meh. But one promising solution here would be to fight software with software. If we could train software to detect the quirks of deepfakes, like the unnatural blinking, or some of the other weird subtle things that the human eye can't pick up on, we would have a strong way of verifying what is real footage,\nand what is distorted. So deepfakes are here, and\nthey're seemingly here to stay. We are entering a new chapter of how humans consume and\nrelate to information. It's a chapter as significant in my mind as some of the other big chapters, like when we learned to\ncapture light and record it. It changed the world! Photographs could be\nused in court as proof. They could be used in science to capture and understand the world around us. In journalism, it allowed\nus to show, not just tell. And when we made those images move, we could capture more truth, more proof, more evidence. And then we could connect, and spread those images far and wide. Truth and evidence coursed\nthrough the world's internet. This evolution of the moving image and its uses in the connected world is taking an unexpected turn, away from being the bedrock of evidence, and towards the foggy territory\nof deception and confusion. We're gonna have to navigate\nthis chapter carefully. We're gonna have to push even harder to know where our images came from, who made them, and for what purpose. And we're gonna have to resist the urge to believe everything we see,\nno matter how real it looks. (solemn music)"

    "captions": "- [Johnny] It's easy to forget that the US still has colonies, (dramatic music) but we don't actually use the word colony, we prefer words like unincorporated\nterritory or commonwealth. These are places where people\nare subject to US rule, but don't enjoy the full\nrights that other Americans do. I wanna tell you about\none of them, Puerto Rico. When you're in Puerto Rico, you're not just in a vacation paradise, you are in a part of the United States. It feels like the United States, but it also feels distinctly different. This feeling, this limbo state\ndidn't happen by accident. In fact, it's perhaps the best example of the lengths the United States\nhas gone to hold onto land. So let me show you how\nthe US kept their colony in the Caribbean using brute force, spying and the abuse of land and people. This is how the US stole Puerto Rico. Pause the video really quick. I need to just tell you something, which is that about three years ago, I started seeing a therapist because I was kind of not\nin a happy place in my life and needed to talk to somebody and it kind of changed my life. It really changed my life. I'm telling you this because it has to do with\nwho's sponsoring today's video. Thank you Better help for sponsoring today's video and the channel generally. I didn't grow up going to\ntherapy or really understood, I sort of thought it was only for if like I had some big mental illness and I needed help, I go see a therapist. What I've learned is that therapy is actually something\nthat I think we all need. In the same way that we all need exercise for our physical bodies, we need help with our\nmental selves as well and that is what therapy can do, and better help is a platform\nthat makes it really easy to find a good therapist\nand start communicating with them immediately. With Better Help, you sign up, you take a quick quiz,\nand then they match you with a licensed therapist\nin their giant network of tens of thousands of therapists that are all over the place. It's not limited to your\ngeographic location. Once you're connected to a therapist, you can very quickly start\ncommunicating however you want. You can do text message\nsessions, you can do video call, you can do phone call. Finding a therapist the\ntraditional way, I've found, is a much more difficult\nand arduous process, which when you're looking for a therapist, you don't want any friction. It's not a very fun thing to do. With better help, if your\ntherapist isn't a good fit, you can switch to a new one for free. In the end, Better Help is trying to make therapy more accessible to all of us so that we can\nlearn more about our minds, how our minds and our emotions work and hopefully live better lives. There's a link in my description, it's betterhelp.com/JohnnyHarris. You get a 10% off your\nfirst month of Better Help, so you can try it out at a discount and see if\nit fits into your life. There's also financial aid for those who need it. So thank you Better help for existing and sponsoring today's video. And now let's dive back into Puerto Rico. (soft music) Okay, so it's 1898 and the Spanish Empire looks\nlike this, but it's faltering. A lot of its colonies are\nfighting for independence. The United States gets involved and allies with a lot of\nthese independence fighters. They say they wanna\nliberate these colonies and so they get into the war and they win. But instead of liberating\nSpain's colonies, they just take them for themselves. And one of those colonies was Puerto Rico. And so on an ordinary\nTuesday from the late 1800's, there was a quiet\nceremony that takes place on the governor's balcony in San Juan. After 400 years of Spanish rule, Puerto Rico, this island in the Caribbean, is simply passed from\none ruler to the next, and this begins an\nunprecedented experiment in the Caribbean for the United States. An operation to extract\nresources, money, labor, and military protection from\nthis small, beautiful island. They start by passing a\nlaw that gives the US total political control over the island. They start appointing American\nleaders to govern the island. Men who don't speak Spanish, don't know anything about\nPuerto Rico or its people. Most of these leaders treat the assignment like a business venture. Like this one guy who when he\nwas the leader of Puerto Rico, starts to give public Puerto Rican funds to American owned\nbusinesses on the island. Then he stacks the government\nwith American loyalists and then eventually he resigns, but then he returns to the\nisland to build a sugar kingdom. Now, with the help of all\nof the political officials that he had appointed, this company balloons\ninto the largest global sugar business on earth. - [Speaker] And when it's\ndomino, you are sure it's pure. - [Johnny] At the same time,\nUS banks descend on the island, giving out very predatory loans and then foreclosing on land, gobbling it up and turning\nit into, you guessed it, sugar farms. Puerto Rico is slowly turning into a sugar island and becoming more and more dependent on\nshipments from the mainland. The US enacts a new policy that says that anything going into Puerto\nRico has to be transported by American ships with American crews. So of course, this skyrockets\nthe prices for locals, which is made worse by the fact that the US government had devalued and then outlawed the local currency. So now every Puerto Rican lost almost half of their wealth overnight, and as a part of this push to lock Puerto Rico in as their colony, they forbid Spanish in schools\nand public institutions. And so in this very short amount of time, the US turned Spain's former colony into this giant sugar farm, stripping down local identity\nand language and culture in the process and locking the\npeople under their control. And then, Congress gives\nPuerto Ricans US citizenship, which conveniently was just in\ntime for a giant global war. So Puerto Rican men got sent to the front lines to fight\nfor the country that was in the process of pillaging their island. By 1922, a series of Supreme Court cases had solidified Puerto Rico as a \"unincorporated territory\" which is just like word salad for the US Constitution\ndoesn't fully apply here. I mean, think about it,\nunincorporated territory, this intentionally\ncontradictory jargon that came from these men hundreds of miles away. But honestly, the message was very clear. Puerto Ricans did not look or sound enough like Americans to actually be\na part of the United States. (dramatic music) By the 1930s, big banks owned\n60% of these sugar farms, 80% of the tobacco farms, and a 100% of the railroads and shipping facilities. At the same time, Puerto\nRicans were being paid less than 4 cents an hour. If you put that into today's\ncurrency by inflation, that's like a dollar an hour. Poverty and malnutrition\nstart to grip this island. All the while the US is turning the island into an essential military outpost. See how Puerto Rico juts out a little bit into the Caribbean? It served as a strategically\npositioned island to help protect trade routes and a place where you could refuel ships. Over time, more and more military bases and installations start\nto pop up on this island. The US would go on to test thousands of bombs in Puerto\nRico, leaving behind one of the most hazardous waste\nsites in the United States. And by the middle of the 1900s, Puerto Rico really starts to mirror what the US envisioned, Puerto Rico, the sugar metropolis. (dramatic music) Puerto Rico, the land of low\nwages and abundant laborers. Puerto Rico, the irreplaceable\nmilitary outmost. The empire that build\nthemselves as the liberators from Spain is now an overlord and the locals start fighting back. (dramatic music) The fight is led by this\nguy, Pedro Albizu Campos. He's this poor kid who\nends up going to Harvard. He graduates valedictorian\nfrom Harvard Law School. He serves the US in World War I and even helps draft Ireland's\nindependence constitution. The guy's kind of a superstar. Ultimately he returns to his hometown to attempt the impossible,\nPuerto Rican independence. But soon, Campos would\nfind himself bouncing in and out of prison for 25 years. Things haven't quite escalated. This movement is just starting. Campos comes back to Puerto Rico with the goal of total separation from the United States,\nand people join him. A lot of people, just every\nday ordinary Puerto Ricans, who are fed up with being\nexploited, they join them, they organize and they call\nthemselves the nationalists. They run for office, they go\non strike, and they fight back against this superpower that\nhas been exploiting them. Momentum begins to pick up and then the dominoes\nreally start to fall. There was this American doctor his name is Cornelius Rhodes, and he went to Puerto Rico saying he's gonna do like health research or something. We know what he really\nwas doing in thinking because he wrote this letter,\nlet me read it to you. He writes that Puerto Ricans are \"beyond doubt, the dirtiest,\nlaziest and most degenerate and peevish race of men ever to have inhabited this sphere.\" And he goes on to say, that it makes him sick to \"inhabit the same island with them,\" but he doesn't stop there. He says that Puerto Ricans need \"something to totally exterminate\nthe entire population.\" And then he admits to a crime. He says, \"I have done my\nbest to further the process of their extermination by killing off eight and transplanting\ncancer into several more.\" I mean, this is bad. This is, it's really bad. But for a lot of Puerto\nRicans, this wasn't surprising. So the staff at the\nhospital find this letter and they send it around to everyone and it goes out and it goes viral. And nothing happens to\nthis guy who has admitted to murdering a bunch of Puerto Ricans. Actually, something does happen. He gets on the front\ncover of Time Magazine. To the nationalists, this letter confirms something\nthat they already knew. It actually wasn't that surprising. There was an awareness that yes, America loves Puerto Rico for\ntheir soil and their labor and their strategic location,\nbut hates them as people. So after this letter,\nthe movement explodes. (upbeat music) It gets to the point where\nthe US and their public government on the island can\nno longer ignore this movement. Soon a bunch of new officers\nare hired and trained and armed with machine guns and tear gas, but the nationalists keep fighting. Then in 1935, police\nkill four nationalists at a university event. The nationalists retaliate\nby killing the police chief. Then without trial, the\npolice execute his killer and arrest, Campos, the\nleader of the movement for plotting to overthrow the government. Campos is given this rigged\ntrial with a jury made up mostly of mainland\nAmericans, and he gets sentenced to prison for 10 years. A few months later, people\nare out peacefully protesting on Palm Sunday and the police\nstart shooting into the crowd. Men, women, children and elders\nare all clubbed and beaten to death and shot in the\nback as they run away. 19 are killed and over\na hundred are wounded, but it still doesn't\nput down the movement. The violence only pours fuel on the fire. Back in Washington DC, they're\nstarting to get worried that this independence movement\nis just gonna keep building and they don't want to give up their island in the Caribbean. There's still plenty of money to be made off of\nPuerto Rican soil and labor, not to mention the military\nbases that they had there. So they turn to an extreme measure. Something that as I learned\nabout and as we reported on, has been blowing my mind in a way that I, I study this stuff a lot. I look at the behavior of empires. I look at how they control people. I've never seen this before. (dramatic music) It starts with FBI agents who come to the island to work with\nthe police of Puerto Rico. They have one simple mission, to spy on anyone who they\ndeem politically subversive and to sabotage them and thus sabotage the\nindependence movement. So they spy on everyone. They spy on the nationalists\nwho are part of the movement but also their friends, their partners, their sexual partners their business colleagues, their children. They track down criminal\nrecords and mistresses and debtors and creditors and photos and license plate numbers, school transcripts, and even\nthe guest list to weddings, like they got really, really detailed. They started listening in on phone calls and intercepting letters. Everything was fair game. The idea was to create panopticon, this idea that they're always watching. They also started to\ncultivate relationships with a network of informers. Often the victim's family or friends or neighbors would get sucked into this state spying apparatus. The FBI uses payments and\ncoercion and manipulation, which often forces people to turn on each other, causing divorce and broken friendship and\nfractured communities. Much of this was done undercover. Like these FBI agents\nwould just be dressed in normal clothes, but would be constantly\nsurveilling the people around them. Oh, and we know about this because they\ndocumented everything. (dramatic music) If you are a person of interest,\nyou probably had a file. All of these files, they're\ncalled The Carpetas. Our story producer Rafaela went to San Juan to see The Carpetas firsthand. - So I'm at the General\nArchive Building in San Juan in Puerto Rico to see\nthe secret surveillance documents that were collected on thousands of Puerto Ricans over so many decades. - [Johnny] After weeks of\nwork, I finally got to look at Las Carpetas to see what\nwas actually in these files. And it's kind of creepy, I have to say. You see specific times and\ndates and details from meetups, detailed descriptions\nof the locations where people are just meeting, all of the names of people involved, these subgroups that were\npotentially supporters of the independence movement. You get these highly detailed\nphysical descriptions of the people that they were tracking, their occupation, the model of their car, their license plate number and all of their moves,\nall of their activities, what they were doing,\nwho they were supporting. And even for those who\nmoved away from Puerto Rico, they continued to track them and knew exactly what apartment\nthey lived in, in the Bronx. They speculated about their\nnationalistic tendencies. And then you see these interviews that agents were having with people close to the target where their\npersonal beliefs are revealed, like one who thought that Puerto Rico would be repaired with\nsocialism and independence. You can see a source telling these agents that they're afraid that their\nfriend had become friends with the leaders of the\nIndependence movement and had been inducted in\nbecause of this friendship. And of course, these informants request that all this information they're spilling to the agents \"be kept secret.\" These agents would even\ninterview family members. Like there's this whole\ntranscript of the agents talking to the mother of someone who was suspected to be a part of the independence movement. Oh yeah. And in all of these documents you see an obsession with who had guns. It's hard to overstate how exhaustive this spine effort was\nand how powerful it was. The FBI was able to use all of this information to intimidate and blackmail and punish\nsuspected nationalists. I mean, there are\nthousands of these examples from children being like kidnapped\nand put into a helicopter by the FBI to people being\ndenied government jobs all because they had a Carpeta. At the end of the day,\nit was psychological war against Puerto Ricans\nwho wanted independence and it worked horrifically well in dividing these people and\nmaking them feel powerless, because they were always being watched in their most personal of moments. Oh, and it wasn't just a couple of years, this lasted for decades. Eventually it gets to\nthe point where Campos and the nationalists\nsee no other way other than armed revolution. In the fall of 1950, the\nNationalists declare Puerto Rico as an independent nation. They attempt to seize towns, to set government buildings\non fire, to cut phone lines. They try to assassinate the governor and let's be honest, it's 1950. Like the United States is easily the most powerful country to have ever existed. These people had no chance of winning against the newly\ncrowned global superpower. Their goal was to bring\nattention to the world, to pressure the US to give up its colony. But instead, the United States responded by dropping bombs, the only time in the history of the United States where\nthey bombed their own citizens. One survivor of the revolution was interviewed five years ago and said that it was a David\nagainst Goliath situation and that their leader told\nthem that they might die, but that they might succeed, but that at least they\nwould've let the world know about Puerto Rico. During this revolution, many of the fighters\nwore their Sunday best, ironed suits and pressed ties, because they knew they would die. They had a cause they were fighting for. In the end, two dozen are killed. Puerto Rico really didn't have a chance. President Truman comes\nout and is sort of like, there was an incident in Puerto\nRico, sort of downplays it. And a couple days later, two nationalists attempt\nto assassinate him. The world doesn't come\nto Puerto Rico's rescue, and instead the police carry out a mass arrest throwing\n3000 people in jail. A few years later, four\nnationalists open fire in the chamber of the US Congress. Campos is arrested again and this time he's sentenced\nto 80 years in prison. There's evidence that\nduring this time in prison, Campos was exposed to\nextreme levels of radiation. The consequences allegedly\ngave him a stroke and left him paralyzed\nand unable to speak. And in the end, the US' wish came true, they silenced Campos for good. (dramatic music) After the squashing of the revolution, the surveillance program\ncontinued for decades. In the end, it was a total of 50 years of state sanctioned spying\non the people of Puerto Rico. When it all came to light, they estimated that around a hundred\nthousand people had files. A lot of people in Puerto Rico\nknew that this was happening, but they just knew it in their gut. They didn't have any real evidence of it. They didn't realize the sheer scale, the methodical approach, that the FBI was taking to spy on them and to divide them and to\npsychologically debase them. In total, it was 1.8 million\npages of documentation and many of the victims of this spying are still alive today. I think the Carpetas are\na really powerful signal of how the US kept its\ncolony in the Caribbean. They were the cementing\nof what the US had done from the beginning, which is\ncreate a system of reliance and oppression where people\nlived and died under the thumb of this massive superpower\nthat was exerting very, very aggressive\ncontrol over these people, these people who were American citizens. It's hard to fully understand and impossible to relate\nto the psychological impact that this program would have\non the people that it affected, but also the generations who came from the people who it affected. Imagine such a pervasive\nforce that was sowing division mistrust, betrayal, and fear, not just of the government,\nbut of each other. Puerto Rico never got\nindependence, and to this day, they remain an unincorporated territory, which means that they\ndon't have the same rights as other American citizens. And the status of the\nisland is a heated debate. Many Puerto Ricans value\nthe modern day benefits of being connected to\nthe US, but at what cost. (dramatic music) This is backlit by the US'\nlasting control over the island. And even though the people of Puerto Rico served in our armed forces, they still can't vote for the president. They still don't have full\nrepresentation in our democracy. And yet Puerto Rico still\nhas this immense impact on American culture and life. The food, the music, the dance,\nthe art from this island, it's a part of what it\nmeans to be American. And yet, I think most\nof us don't really think about the status of this place\nvery often or its history. It's only when there's like\na hurricane on this island and we see the US kind of barely show up relative to how they show\nup for their other citizens. Only then are we reminded that Puerto Rico is a colonial possession, one taken in war and exploited through\npredatory and racist policies and then held onto\nthrough a massive amount of state force spying,\nviolence and repression. And what we're left with\nis yet another example of a place whose vibrant\nspirit and culture and people are somehow able\nto shine through the dark fog of colonial abuse that has left\ndeep wounds on this island.

(slides clicking) Nobody lives here, but here's\nfootage from January 2023 of construction workers\narriving to this island. Their task is to build a\ncouple of runways on the island and some storage\nfacilities for ammunition. The Japanese government has\nbeen paying local fishermen to stay away from this island. That's because they're turning\nit into a military base. The island is being built by Japan, but one of its main purposes has to do with the United States. American fighter jets and aircraft carriers have\nhad to do their drills and practices down here on this island, but now they're able to\nstation at this island, moving them much closer to this ocean and to one country in particular. (tense music) Mageshima is just one of many islands that are being loaded up\nwith military hardware, most of it coming from the United States. It's part of this chain\nof militarized islands, an effort of defense or aggression, depending on how you look at it. It's a line that centers on Taiwan, and it's what one\nofficial was referring to when they said that\n2023 is likely to stand as the most transformative\nyear in US force posture in this region in a generation. This line is a symbol of the rising tensions\nbetween global superpowers, and I wanna show you why\nthis is happening now and what it means for the\nfuture of this conflict. - This is unlike anything\nthe US Navy has done since World War II. - Tensions are rising in one of the most hotly\ncontested regions on the planet, the South China Sea. - [Pilot] Philippine military aircraft, I'm warning you again. Leave immediately. - Hey, I'm gonna pause\nthe story really quick to tell you about today's\nsponsor, who is CoPilot, which is a product that I actually use almost\nevery day of my life. CoPilot is a platform\nwhere you get paired up with a fitness coach. You meet with that fitness coach. It's a real person. It's not like an AI. And that fitness coach talks to you about your fitness goals, and then they design a custom fitness plan for you using their app. Every day when I do my workout,\nI just open up the app, and I hit start workout, and it guides me through\nwith video demonstrations and a timer through every\none of my exercises. These are exercises that\nare literally designed for me and my goals. And my goals aren't to, like, get buff. I'm just trying to like work out so that I feel strong\nand feel good in my body, and that is what my\nworkout is designed to do. It also pairs up with my watch so that it cues me on\nto the next exercise. Oftentimes I'm like listening to a podcast or a book or music, and I can just visually\nsee all of these cues. It's incredibly convenient\nand very smooth. At the end of my workout, I have the opportunity to then communicate with my coach and say like, \"Hey, I wanted a little bit\nmore like core workout,\" or like, \"The pushups were\ntoo intense this time. Let's tone it down.\" And then my coach, Devyn, will\nactually modify my workout for the next day so that\nit fits my feedback. What I love about CoPilot is that it's much more\nabout accountability. Like when I work out, I know that there's somebody\nwho's gonna check in with me and ask how the workout went. CoPilot found that their clients\nare nine times more likely to stick to their goals when\nthey have a real-person coach who is designing a workout for them, which is like not surprising to me. Of course, they are. Accountability and consistency\nis the hardest thing with fitness as we all know. And CoPilot solves that by pairing you up with a real person. I've been doing this now\nfor like eight months, and it's been really, really cool. I've changed my workout a bunch. I've like met with my coach and like reshaped my entire\nworkout based on new goals, and I just think it's\na fantastic platform. So thank you, CoPilot,\nfor sponsoring the video. There's a link in my description. It is go.mycopilot.com/johnny-harris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gives you\n14 days of free CoPilot, access to your own personal fitness coach. You can test it out and see if it helps you with\naccountability and fitness, which is something we all need\nto feel good in our bodies. So thank you, CoPilot, for\nsponsoring today's video. Let's dive back into this important story. Here we go. Okay, so this document from\nthe US Department of Defense, this document is called the\nNational Defense Strategy of the United States of America, which also includes the\nNuclear Posture Review and Missile Defense Review. It's basically a report that\nthey release every four years that gives us an understanding of what the US military is\nup to, what they care about. - [Radio Operator] Zero, three,\nbe advised we have a visual. - But this year's is more\ndetailed than normal. The document focuses a lot on China. - If China threatens our sovereignty, concerns directly with China. - The DoD says that China, quote, \"remains our most consequential\nstrategic competitor for coming decades.\" Why? Because, the Pentagon says,\nChina is bullying its neighbors to, quote, \"reshape the region\nand the international system to fit its authoritarian preferences.\" Now, remember that the United States, who spends loads on its military, has set the rules for our global order, how we trade, what\npolitical systems we favor, who participates in the system, and now we see a country\nthat wants to dethrone them to create a new system\nbased on other values and other rules. (energetic electronic music) And what scares the US military is that China is rapidly modernizing and expanding their military. China's military is\ngrowing incredibly fast. Like they deploy the equivalent of an entire new British\nNavy every four years. Every four years, it's\nlike new British Navy, like new Royal Navy every four years. Yeah, they're just growing very quickly. This report is concerned\nabout China's growing strength and military footprint. (troops yelling in foreign language) - How China is coercing its neighbors, disregarding ocean\nboundaries, testing missiles, bullying fishing vessels\nin other countries' waters, building islands and military\nbases on those islands, and flying over other countries' airspace and especially in Taiwan, the island that China claims as their own and where the globe gets nearly all of their advanced microchips, which is a topic I made\nan entire video about. The point is Taiwan is an\nincredibly important island for the United States. All of this together makes China, quote, \"the only country that has the intent and power to actually challenge\nthe US-led global order and rewrite global rules and norms,\" something the US has gotten\nreally comfortable doing over the last 70 years. So this is why the US considers China the most consequential\nstrategic competitor for coming decades, and they've\ncreated a plan to respond. And in their words, \"We cannot delay.\" They give themselves this 10-year window to implement some major changes, and this is what it looks like. Okay, first things first. The US military is already\nvery present in Asia. We've got about 8,000 troops in Guam. We've got over 100 bases in Japan with about 21,000 American\ntroops on the mainland and another 24,000 stationed down here on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Go up to South Korea, and\nyou'll find 22,000 US troops. And then you've got the US Navy who operates out of\nthis port in Singapore. This has been the status\nquo in Asia for decades, and it has been the way that the US has ensured\nsecurity for its allies, and it's kind of mostly worked to help secure American\ninterests and deter conflict. The US has maintained strong\nalliances in this region and, frankly, the Pentagon\nhas kind of been distracted with other things, two wars\nthat happened in the Middle East over the past 20 years. - My fellow citizens, my fellow citizens. - Surrendered at 4:00.\n- My fellow citizens. - But as those conflicts wind\ndown and as China militarizes, the Department of Defense\nsays that this status quo, all of these troops in\nAsia, it's not enough. They talk about this\nnew kind of deterrence, integrated deterrence, the only kind of military posture that will actually keep China at bay. And this is what it looks like. The smallest part of\nthe strategy has to do with American bases. They're gonna reopen a base in Guam and move some troops there. But the majority of\nthis strategy has to do with American allies in Asia, allies that are in\nlockstep with the US's goal to deter and contain China. The Pentagon calls partnering with its allies the center\nof gravity for this strategy. So let's start with Japan, one of the US's closest\nallies in the region. Japan is a country that\nis deeply concerned about a more powerful China, with its massive navy and its\nambitions to control Taiwan. And it's very easy to forget\nthat Japan isn't just this. It's actually all of this. It extends way down here\nbecause of all these islands. These islands curve\nnicely all the way down till they hit Taiwan. All of these are Japanese islands. I mean, if you look at Japan's\nnational defense strategy translated into English, you will see something that\nlooks strikingly similar to what the Pentagon released. They're both really\nfreaked out about China, and they both are ready to act in lockstep to deter a more aggressive\nChina in the region. So it starts up here with that\nisland that we talked about at the beginning, Mageshima, this new military base and airstrip to be used by both\nJapanese and US militaries. Further south is Amami Island, where Japan has recently\nadded long-range missiles and anti-ship missiles. Potentially they're gonna\nadd cruise missiles. These are missiles that they're buying from the United States. These are missiles that are definitely in range of the Taiwan Strait. Next in the chain is Okinawa, where the US has a huge presence of tens of thousands of troops already. Japan also has military bases here and is adding even more\nlong-range missiles and electronic warfare units for military installations\nmeant to disrupt and deny communication signals. On these two islands down here, they're adding even more\nlong-range missiles, which could potentially be used to attack Chinese naval\nships and aircraft. And Japan is placing nearly\n600 troops on Ishigaki as well. And finally you've got this\nlast militarized island in the chain, Yonaguni. It's the closest island to Taiwan. And here Japan is adding more of those electronic warfare units which are used to jam\ncommunication signals or to listen in on their communications. You know, they're right next to China. Japan is also positioning\nmore troops here. So this is the first part of our chain, and when paired with training that Japan and US troops are doing to simulate island and amphibious warfare, it sends a really strong signal to China that Japan is ready to respond if needed. This line also serves as like a physical barrier\nthat any Chinese ship or submarine would have to pass through in order to access the Pacific Ocean. It's a line that Japan can\neasily control and monitor, and it also builds a wall of missiles. Any calculus that China is making on whether or not to invade Taiwan or to do anything in the\nregion will have to now factor in this wall of missiles ready to roll. Overall, this increased military presence on this chain of islands gives Japan and by extension, the United States, the ability to monitor communications and troop movements of China, preparing them to act quickly. And it also gives them the\nability to pre-position troops and supplies throughout the region, which is a major logistical advantage. But all of this comes\nwith a massive price tag. So, Japan, which is\nformally a pacifist nation without like a huge military, is actually planning to\ndouble their defense spending. They're spending way more on buying weapons than\nthey ever have before, and 97% of those weapons are\ncoming from the United States. The island-chain strategy\ncontinues down here with the Philippines, close to Taiwan and close to the South China Sea. The US knows that it needs\nto bolster its presence here, but it's not as straightforward\nas it is in Japan. The Philippines was a\nUS colony for decades. It's a very sensitive history. And even after Filipino independence, the US maintained a military presence in the Philippines until like the '90s. And then they eventually\nkicked out the US, as many saw it as just an\nenduring legacy of US colonialism. But a more aggressive China\nhas become a major threat to the Philippines. Now listen, I'm not gonna go into like a full South\nChina Sea thing here, but just know that\nChina claims all of this as their maritime boundary. It's literally a line with nine dashes that some Chinese official in\n1948 drew by hand on a map. This line blasts through the boundaries that the rest of the world recognizes as the Filipino territorial waters. So there's a conflict in the ocean, and now on a daily basis, Filipino fishing vessels are harassed by Chinese military vessels, who threaten them if they\ndon't leave their waters. In 2022, China put a temporary stop to all fishing in the South China Sea, denying the Philippines' ability to fish in the West Philippine Sea, which is rightfully their waters. But it's crazier than that. The Chinese Navy is like full-blown just bullying the Philippines. They like show up with lasers to harass and blind Filipino ships. I mean, let's remember the Philippines is a much\nsmaller nation than China and doesn't really have a navy\neven close to what China has. So now they're in this\nimpossible decision. They have to choose between\ngiving up their sovereignty and fishing rights to their\naggressive neighbor, China, or partnering with their former colonizer, who also wants to repel China. And in this case, they chose the latter. - China has pushed too hard. It's pushed the Philippines\nin the South China Sea, what they call the West Philippine Sea. - The Philippines is planning\nto boost its military presence in the disputed South China Sea. - It started in 2014, when\nthey allowed the US back in for the first time in 22 years. The US presence will\ntechnically be in bases that are owned by the Philippines, but the US can have troops, build barracks and other military installations, and can have pre-positioned\nsupplies there as well. It's basically like\nthe US has bases there, but it's like, sh, it's\nactually the Philippines. And as part of all of this\nthat we've been talking about, in late 2022, they\nexpanded their agreement, giving the US military\naccess to four more bases, bringing the total number of bases on the Philippines up to nine. And look where they selected to put them, here in the north of the country, strategically close to Taiwan and helping fill their gap in their island chain\nthat they're creating. This now allows US to have a military presence\nreally close to Taiwan. The US trains very closely with\ntheir Filipino counterparts, making them ready to respond very quickly to an invasion in Taiwan while also repelling Chinese bullying of Filipino fishing activity. Okay, so now the island\nchain is filling out, giving the US and its regional\npartners a solid blockade to the Pacific, and it continues all the way\ndown around the South China Sea because of the US presence in Singapore. This is a very united front,\nbut it doesn't stop here. (camera shutter clicks) The last part of the strategy is potentially the most significant, and it has to do with Australia, a country that is also alarmed by China's rise in the region. So there's this military pact between the US, the UK, and Australia. It's called AUKUS. What it means is that\nthese three countries will work together to create\na unified submarine force that will patrol the Pacific. First what it means is\nthat the US is giving, giving, nuclear submarine technology, its most powerful and advanced\nweapon, freely to Australia. Here, here are the designs\nto our most powerful weapons. Take them, foreign country. And then the US and UK\nwill base submarines out of this port here in Australia. It's called Perth. Australian sailors will ride alongside US and UK sailors during\nsubmarine deployments. They will learn together. They will work together. They will share classified intelligence. What this means is that there will be a\nsignificantly larger number of submarines patrolling these waters. And remember, these are\nnuclear-powered submarines, which we made a whole video on as well. These things can be underwater for months. They can go on these long\npatrols over to Taiwan and the South China Sea. They can close up these key choke points, plugging holes in their\ngrowing line against China. And crucially, we can\nbe pretty damn certain that a lot of these submarines will be carrying nuclear weapons, adding yet another\nlayer of deterring power to an already really\npowerful line of defense. And if this wasn't enough, Australia is also building\na permanent hangar for US B-52 bombers up\nhere in the Tindal Airbase in Northern Australia. These US bombers carry\nconventional weapons, but they also carry nukes. So now US bombers carrying nuclear weapons will have a permanent home in Australia. There's gonna be a lot\nmore military hardware in the Pacific because of this, hardware that carries the most powerful and dangerous weapons we have. This is a very aggressive signal to China that the West is ready. (camera shutter clicks) So now if you look at the\nwhole thing, this whole chain, you see how robust this presence is. This is what that military\nofficial meant by transformative. The military name for this\nis the first island chain, and it is at the heart of the US' and its allies' strategy to\ncounter and contain China. And it's easy to see\nthat this island chain, while protecting a lot\nof different interests for a lot of different countries,\nreally centers on Taiwan. A major purpose for all\nof this militarization, the missiles, the subs,\nthe airbases, the troops, is to prepare for conflict in Taiwan. And this is where we get to\nthe paradox of deterrence. You prepare to fight so that\nyou don't have to fight. All of this preparation\nmight be just what is needed for China to decide that\nit would be too costly to invade Taiwan. But the other side of that paradox is that all of this looks an\nawful lot like overt escalation in a conflict. If you're China, this chain of islands is clearly your\nenemy trying to box you in to monitor your every move, a superpower from the other side of the world flooding your region with more military hardware\nto stop your influence. It would be impossible for\nthis plan to not contribute to a rising of tensions\nbetween the two superpowers. - All this as the US prepares for a potential conflict with China. - How close are we to all-out conflict between the world's two\nlargest superpowers? (Chinese minister speaking\nin foreign language) - Chinese President Xi Jinping has already called this a policy of encirclement and suppression. And let's be honest, he's right. Whether you like it or not, this is containment old-school,\nCold War-style containment. It's hard not to see it\nwhen you look at this map, and the Chinese Foreign Minister said that it would literally be impossible for China to not fight back to take a move that\nretaliates against this move, which means that if the US and its allies aren't\ncareful with all of this, it may send a signal to China that now is the time to invade Taiwan before all of this plan\ncan fully be implemented. In that sense, this strategy\ncould provoke the very conflict that it is trying to deter. (suspenseful music) Hey, everyone, thanks for\nwatching today's video.

    "captions": "- This was a struggle of Cuban patriots\nagainst a Cuban dictator. - [Johnny] On March 13th,\n1962, the Joint Chiefs of staff put this document in front of the Secretary of Defense for approval from the president. This is a memo prepared by the most senior\nleaders in the US military some of the most powerful\nmen in the country. And they're asking for\npermission to execute a plan. A plan to lob mortar shells\ninto their own military bases with some damage to installations. And then to make hijacking attempts against civilian air and surface craft. They're proposing to blow up a US ship in the US naval base, Guantanamo Bay and even to conduct a terror\ncampaign on American soil exploding a few plastic explosives in carefully chosen spots. We're looking at a plan to\nblow things up on American soil and then to blame it all on Cuba. - Cuban people have not yet\nspoken their final piece. - [Johnny] This operation never happened, but it almost did. And that gets to a big question. Why would some of America's\nmost powerful leaders charged with safeguarding our nation think that their duty would require them to lie to and terrorize\nthe American people? In other words, why were they\nplanning Operation Northwoods? - We did not the first time that communist tanks have\nrolled over gall men and women. Let the record show that our\nrestraint is not inexhaustible. - Before we dive into\ntoday's kind of insane video, I need to thank the sponsor who I'm very grateful for.

Thank you, BetterHelp for\nsponsoring today's video. Let's dive back into Operation Northwood. (dramatic music) Operation Northwoods was a response to a problem\nthe US government had. They called it the Cuba problem. (dramatic music) Cuba became a problem for the CIA when they watched this young activist with an affinity for cigars\nlead a communist revolution on the island, throwing out\nthe American friendly dictator and nationalizing all the\nvaluable land and industries that American businesses had been getting rich off for decades. This was the Cold War, and communism was now 90 miles away threatening to spread to other\ncountries in Latin America. Countries that American businesses also wanted to continue\ncontrolling and exploiting. And any day, this new leader could align with the Soviet Union giving the US' biggest geopolitical rival a military base within\nbreathing distance of Florida. (dramatic music) So this was what the joint\nChiefs called their Cuba problem. (dramatic music) The US had a few solutions\nto their problem. First, they put an embargo on Cuba blocking all US exports to the country except for food and medicine. Second, they stopped buying\nCuba's largest export sugar. This actually ended up backfiring when the Soviet Union\nstepped in to buy Cuban sugar kicking off an economic alliance between these two communist countries exactly what the US didn't want. And third, the US started making plans. (dramatic music) Lots of plans, plans to\nsomehow get rid of Castro, to turn Cuba back into\nthe American business friendly client state through\nwhatever means necessary. In one of these secret plans\ncalled Operation Zapata, the CIA recruited 1500 Cuban exiles who fled to Miami during\nthe Cuban Revolution. It was this little CIA funded\narmy called Brigade 2506, and the goal was to have them invade Cuba and remove Castro from power. So the CIA trains them at this camp in the mountains of Guatemala where they had just\nrecently executed a coup and installed a US friendly dictator. And right in the middle\nof the planning stages of this operation, JFK\nwins the presidency. - Ask not what your\ncountry can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. - [Johnny] And he inherits\nthis scheme to invade Cuba using exiled Cubans. The CIA briefs them on it. This plan to fix the Cuba problem by forcibly unseating\nCastro using Cuban exiles. And after some debate,\nJFK approves the plan. (dramatic music) So on the 17th of April, 1961 they launched their invasion Brigade 2506 landed on Playa Giron with\nthe plan to invade the island and spark a popular\nrevolution against Castro. - The assault on the\ndictatorship of Fidel Castro, landings were affected\nby rebels as several. - [Johnny] But it was a complete failure. Castro had found out about\nthe invasion ahead of time. A radio station on the beach had spotted the invading ships arriving\nand called for help. Several of the invading\nships sank on the coral reef and the invading forces were\nmet with immediate resistance from Cuban armed forces who\ndefeated them within three days, most of them were captured. Nine US servicemen actually\nflew combat missions in support of this invasion, four of which were shot down\nand killed in the process, something the US government and the CIA would go on to deny for almost 30 years. But the point is that this\ninvasion failed miserably and JFK and his\nadministration were to blame. - Two laws, we have fixed our eyes on traditional military needs, on armies prepared to cross borders, on missiles pois for flight. Now, it should be clear that\nthis is no longer announced. - [Johnny] JFK would later\nfire the CIA director holding him responsible for the disastrous invasion plan that we\nknow as the Bay of Pigs. But this didn't change anything. The US government was still obsessed with removing Castro from power. They just needed a new plan. So JFK initiates his own\nplan called the Cuba Project aka Operation Mongoose. Over the next year, the\nCIA employs 100s of spies to collect intelligence on Cuba. They send submarines on recon\nmissions to Cuban waters. They fund anti-Castro protest movements spreading propaganda\nthroughout the country. They sabotage Cuban\ninfrastructure to create chaos, and they make dozens more plans to assassinate Castro directly including preparing poisonous pills to be planted in a beverage\nto be drunk by Castro. They even hired the American\nmafia to deliver the pills knowing that the mafia had their casinos kicked out\nof Havana during the revolution and would want revenge. But none of this worked. The assassination attempts all fell apart. Fidel Castro still remained in power and his support wasn't wavering. And the US military was getting desperate. They needed to solve the Cuba problem before the Soviets could get\nmore involved on the island. So after all these botched\nassassination attempts and failed invasions, the\njoint chiefs of staff concluded that the only way to get rid of Castro was for the US military\nitself to invade Cuba and take him out. But they knew that the US public would not support an outright invasion. They needed to create a\nreason, a justification. And this gets us back to our document. (dramatic music) The one that went to\nthe Secretary of Defense for the president's approval. This cover and deception plan to make attacks on American targets. Fake attacks that will be blamed on Cuba to raise tensions between the US and Cuba to justify an invasion,\na legitimate provocation as the basis for a US\nmilitary intervention in Cuba. In other words, a lie\nto the American public and the international community, a series of false flags\nto get what they wanted and all detailed in\nthis classified document that was only meant for a few people. With hopes that the\npresident would approve in the spring of 1962. (dramatic music) - If the nations of this\nhemisphere should fail to meet their commitments against outside communist penetration, then I want it clearly understood that this government will not hesitate in meeting its primary obligations which are to the security of our nation. - [Johnny] So let's see what\nthis plan actually says. It starts with the US military\nbase at Guantanamo Bay, where they would start rumors\nusing fake radio stations and get American friendly\nlocals to stage fake attacks on the base starting riots\nin the surrounding area. Another proposed part of the plan was to blow up a US ship\nand blame it on Cuba. This was specifically called out as \"Remember the Maine\" incident\nreferencing the sinking of an American war ship\nin Cuba in the late 1800s that the US used to justify\nintervening in Cuba back then to fight the Spanish. This is often thought\nof as a planned sabotage to justify the intervention. And here was the US military\nin the '60s added again. The document predicts that the newspapers would start reporting on the casualties causing a helpful wave\nof national indignation. They also wanted to create\na fake terrorist campaign on American soil in Miami or Washington. They wanted to sink\nboats of Cuban refugees and stage the shooting of refugee targets and even suggested exploding\na few plastic bombs in American cities. These weren't all going to be pretend. They even say in the document that they would go to the\nextent of wounding people and then making fake arrests\nwith prepared documents. So it could all be widely publicized, making Cuba look like an\nirresponsible government worthy of American intervention. They thought through having\nAmerican Air Force pilots fly over places like Nicaragua and drop bombs on Kane\nFields to burn them down using weapons from the Soviet Union. But for this to work, they would have to be flying\nCuban military style aircraft. They would need to\nensure that their planes were properly painted. They would also use these planes to harass Americans civilian aircraft, making it look like it\nwas the Cubans doing this. They planned a fake hijacking\nof commercial planes to blame the Cuban government or to fake shooting down\na civilian airliner. And if that wasn't enough the joint Chiefs planned\nto create an incident which will make it appear\nthat communist Cuban jets have destroyed a US Air Force aircraft while it was flying over\ninternational waters in an unprovoked attack. Operation Northwoods was a reckless plan to lie and hurt people proposed by top government leaders who were more and more\ndesperate to invade Cuba, and they wanted to move fast. They say in just a few months, they needed to do this so that this attack wouldn't involve the Soviet Union who still hadn't established\nany defense packed or military bases in Cuba. So what we're looking at here\nis the increasing desperation of the US military to achieve its goal to solve the Cuba problem. If JFK would just approve this plan, then the military would get\nto work blowing things up, attacking their bases and\nterrorizing the American people. But he rejected it. Operation Northwoods never happened. JFK's rejection of this plan is one reason that there was a rift between him and the military. With the military wanting\nto take a hard line on Cuba and JFK feeling the sting\nof the Bay of Pigs invasion, thinking that something like\nthis was too much of a risk. A month later, another\ndocument came to him, the Joint Chiefs following\nup with another memo saying that the only way to\nremove the communist regime was military intervention\nby the United States, and that Cuba was a vital base\nof operations for espionage, sabotage and subversion against other countries in the region. The fear was that communism would spread across Latin America because of this and time is running out. The rift between JFK and\nthe military continued during the Cuban Missile Crisis when the Joint Chiefs hoped\nto deploy nuclear missiles against the Soviets and invade Cuba. But JFK stood up to the\nmilitary once again and said no. JFK eventually went on to\ndeny General Lyman Lemnitzer another term as Chairman of\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. Likely because of his leading role in planning Operation Northwood and looking at this bizarre\nepisode in American history, you might feel like this is a moment where our system worked. Military leaders tried\nto abuse their power to launch an unprovoked and illegal invasion of another country, and the President stopped them. Checks imbalances, right? But the reality is all these\nmen have the same goal. Castro out of power and\nCuba under their control. Again, their disagreement was\none of just a few degrees. The means not the ends. The reality is that the US was one man, just one person away from\nthis operation happening from a full scale invasion. If JFK had lost the presidency to Nixon, would Operation Northwoods have happened? We can't say conclusively but it certainly raises the probability. But what's more startling is\nthat outside of a few norms and some ideas about government, nothing fundamentally has\nchanged in our government. The political military machine still runs on the same software it did in the '60s. If the US government felt like it and had a big enough enemy, a big enough threat to American interests, it could happen again. (dramatic music) - The Iraqi regime has\nplotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear\nweapons for over a decade. States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to\nthreaten the peace of the world."

    "captions": "- [Voice-Over 1] After the Civil War, many of the Plains Indians\nwere moved to Oklahoma. - [Johnny] There's a place in\nthe middle of North America with a story that you should know about. - [Voice-Over 2] This is Oklahoma. - [Johnny] It's not the\none about the violent dust that pushed people out or the novel about a\nhomicide and a drought. Or the songs and dances about rivalries between\nfarmers and cowboys. It's the story of what\nhappened before all of this, the story of checkered board maps and lines and private\nproperty and broken promises. All because of this.\n(subdued music) This place was a dumping\nground for the people that the US government\nwanted to get rid of, which is why today, it has\nthe second highest number of first Americans of any state. It was once a random rectangle that the US government used\nto ship native populations after they removed them with a new weapon of state power, paperwork, treaties and payments and spreadsheets, pretend justice. That's the story we\ntalked about in part one. The next part is how these first Americans created a state of their own,\nfighting against their captors to retain one last shred of\nsovereignty over their land. The land that had been taken\nfrom them over and over again. - [Voice-Over 1] A frontier\npeople had remade a continent, the United States of America. (rhythmic music) (tense music) - Hey, before we go on, let me tell you something\ndisturbing kind of, which is I recently learned that my name and all of my personal details\nwere on a people search list. It's just one of many sides of this massive shadowy\nmarket of data brokers who collect loads of\ninformation about all of us, and then sell it to companies, so that they can market to us. The reason I'm telling you all of this is because it has to do with\nthe sponsor of today's video, Incogni.\n(transition music) I'm very happy that Incogni exists. You sign up and you give them permission to go out on your behalf, to\ntake you off of these lists. We have privacy rights that entitle us to not be on these lists, but it's really complicated and bureaucratic to actually do it. And there are dozens and\ndozens of these lists. So, instead, Incogni does it for you. I've been signed up for Incogni for a few months now,\nand it is so satisfying. You have this dashboard that shows you all of the\nlists that they found you on, and then they show you\nthe status of each one, the efforts that they're taking\nto get you off this list. And then, the best part\nis they show you the list that you have been\nsuccessfully taken off of. If you wanna try this out,\nthere's a link in my description. It is incogni.com/johnnyharris.

Thank you, Incogni,\nfor helping me out here and also for sponsoring today's video. Let's dive back into the story. Okay, so remember in part one, I showed you how the US\ngovernment used bureaucracy and a particularly\nhorrible law to push out over a hundred thousand people,\nto push them off their land. Many of them ending up here in a little rectangle that the\nUS called Indian Territory. And crucially, in the process of kicking these nations off their land, the US government promised that they would leave them alone, that they could live in peace, rebuild their lives, relearn their land. So, over the course of the 1800s, more and more tribes are exiled and arrive here to Indian Territory. The territory gets divided again and again as these tribes are crammed into this one rectangle,\nwhich results in this map. And a reminder that each of these nations had their own government\nand culture and language, and yet they were all dumped in this one place and labeled, Indian. So, they ended up here knowing that it would be hard, but okay, at least we\ncan rebuild a new life without the anxiety of White settlers unfairly\nclaiming our land. Oops, no, here they come. (robust music) - [Voice-Over 1] The westward movement was like a great tidal wave, sweeping westward past\nthe Mississippi River. - Over in the east, the Americans had now convinced themselves that it was their literal\ndestiny to keep spreading west. And as they're doing so, they\nstumble upon this rectangle, this rectangle that they\nthought they would never reach. But no, they're not\nallowed to settle here, because it's allocated\nfor Indians by treaties like real ironclad treaties. Okay, but wait, here in\nthe center of this map, you see this little section. What does that say? Here, let's look at a different map. (map crinkles) Oh, unassigned land. Let's settle here. - [Voice-Over 1] When the land was thrown open to White settler- - And by settle, I mean\nnot like by the land or sign anything, just show up to this empty-looking\nflat area and just settle. Soon, these imperial squatters\nare farming the land. They're building a life,\na society in the west, but right in the heart of the territory that the US government had signed treaties promising to first Americans. Oh, and by the way, I'm just gonna get this outta the way now, maps around this time start to show this weird little panhandle that doesn't make any sense, literally called no man's land, because nobody really claimed it. And then, a bunch\n(gun firing) of criminals started living here, because there was no law. (horse neighing) Anyway, some day I'll go into that one. We're talking about Indian Territory and word soon gets out that this place is the new trendy part of town. The federal government is\nhesitant, like wait a minute, we had promised these people this land, like let's just back off. But the squatters kept\ncoming and clamoring. And soon, there was a\nrailroad that was built that went right through here,\nbringing even more settlers. And finally, the government was like, fine, you can move in and settle in this one little\nsection of unassigned land in the middle of Indian Territory, but it's gonna be first come, first serve. And so, we'll make it a race? Yes, a race, like\nliterally there was a race. There was a starting line and there was a gunshot.\n(gun fires) And 50,000 settlers hungry for new land in covered wagons dashed forth to claim some\n(horse neighs) of this 2 million acres of unassigned land in hopes of getting cheap\nproperty and starting a new life. The tidal wave of Europeans continues. They're hearing about\nthese mystically huge plots of land in the west, the American dream. As unassigned land started to fill up, the settlers started to look around at all of this land\nthat yeah, technically, had been promised to the natives, but they weren't really using it to farm. So, like no harm if we just\nset up shop here, right? So, they start doing this and the government has to get involved. So, in 1890, they draw this line. It cuts Indian Territory in half, leaving all of this as well as the random\nno man's land panhandle to become a new territory. They would call it Oklahoma. So, Indian Territory now is just this land for the five civilized tribes. That's what the federal\ngovernment called them. But all the tribes that had lived here were now in the new territory of Oklahoma. And their land was suddenly up for grabs. And once again, here come\nthe maps and the documents and all the stuff that\nbasically made this feel like it was official and right. A lot of these maps have squares on them. Look at these squares,\nperfectly checkered squares. All of these squares,\nthese checkerboard maps show us how differently European settlers and their government saw\nthe world than the natives. The concepts of communal land use and lack of personal property\nthat tribes abided by was considered backwards and uncivilized. From the European view, they're not using the land productively. So, we need to create a system of grids and plots and land titles to\nget the most out of this land. This process of drawing a bunch of squares on the land that had\nformerly been promised to natives was called allotment. And it meant taking\ntribal territory like this and drawing a bunch of straight lines to\nmake it a massive grid. And then, they would find out where native families were living and allow them to stay there. But everything else was up for grabs. - [Voice-Over 3] The signal\nwas given and the race was on. - And here come more of those weird races. Four more, in fact, each bringing in floods\nof settlers into this land that had been promised by\ntreaty to somebody else. And look, these maps start\nto fill up with names. Alice Roy, Julia Deladge has this square. These are people coming from Europe looking for the American dream and finding maps full of squares and land to claim, allotment. This real estate boom came\nwith a marketing boom as well. (paper crinkles) Indian land for sale. Get a home of your own, easy payments. Possession within 30 days. And look, they're\nadvertising that here in 1911 that they have 350,000\nacres available for sale. There is so much land up for grabs. It was the same thing as before, what we talked about in the first video, but just happening again in a different place by different people. It was maps and documents and bureaucracy, cutting down native sovereignty and culture square by square. With all of this carving up, settlers start outnumbering\nthe indigenous people. The five tribes were\nstill technically safe from all of this allotment for a time, but they saw what was coming. They had learned time and time again that the United States government for all of their treaties and promises never actually kept the\nagreements that they signed. And they were right. Soon, there was a law passed that said that all tribal governments and tribal courts would\nbe abolished by 1906. So, as the last ditch\neffort to fight back, the five tribes gathered\nand devised a plan to salvage some shred\nof their sovereignty. (robust music) This was a time when US territories were making proposals to be states, and new states were\npopping up left and right. So, if these tribes wanted to ban together and make a state of their\nown, this was their time. They called the state Sequoyah, in honor of the man who created\nthe Cherokee writing system. And so, the year before\nall the tribal governments were to be abolished by law, the tribes held the Sequoyah\nConstitutional Convention, where hundreds of spectators\ngathered to watch the delegates create and write a constitution complete with a bill of rights, trade regulations, tax\npolicy, county borders. And by the end of it, they had produced this\n35,000-word document separated into 18 articles, 270 sections that had everything they\nneeded for a proper state. It was unanimously ratified and in a public vote\noverwhelmingly endorsed by the citizens in Indian Territory. And honestly, if you read this document, it's kind of a story from the population to the economy to education\nand taxable wealth. They deserve to be a state. But then, they appeal to the\nhumanity of the government that had done so much\nharm to their people, their culture, and their home. They appeal to this, quote, natural right of people\nto govern themselves, quote, by the fact that\nwe constitute a separate and distinct community from any on earth with a different history, associations, and ideals and hopes. These people had been boxed\nout time and time again. And now, they were appealing to the values of these Europeans who\nhad taken their land using their language and their legal tools to make the case for their statehood. (rhythmic music) (transition music) Okay, so now, with their\nwell-formulated constitution, their solid proposal, their\nmaps, all of it in hand, the tribal leaders went to Washington. - [Voice-Over 1] The (indistinct) of Congress. - Ready to lobby for a state, and (sharply inhales) Congress didn't even look at the proposal. Like they didn't even look at the... Like they didn't even look at it. It wasn't like a debate. It's just like they just were\nlike, no, of course no, not. It was like dead on arrival. (subdued music) (transition music) First, just because of plain old politics. The Republican majority at the time didn't want a state that\nwould mean more senators and congressmen for Democrats, something that Republican president, Teddy Roosevelt, especially didn't like. It was also about resources. Sequoyah had oil and farmland that Oklahoma territory didn't have. And we aren't gonna let the native people have like all these resources. But in addition to this,\nmany White lawmakers didn't like the idea of a\nstate run by brown people. So, the proposal died.\nSequoyah never became a state. If there was going to be a\nstate, there could only be one. And indeed, two years\nlater, a new map was drawn. All of this land that\nwas going to be Sequoyah was swallowed into a new\nstate, the 46th, Oklahoma. But of course, they wouldn't throw away all the work that these tribes had put into Sequoyah's constitution. So, they just took it for themselves. The Oklahoma constitution\nis basically word for word what was written in\nSequoyah's constitution. One historian called it, quote, the ultimate cut and paste job. (heart monitor flatlines) So, this is what Oklahoma looks like. And they reserved one small chunk for the native people to\ngovern themselves up here. So, just as a quick recap,\ntime-lapse of the whole thing, remember that first Americans, the people who had lived\nhere for thousands of years went from roaming freely\naround all of this to being driven out and\ndumped into this rectangle, and then eventually cut in half, and then grided up square\nby square and sold, to then being further reduced to this. Today, there are 39 recognized\ntribal nations in Oklahoma, but just one of them has a reservation. Now, listen, this is one little shred of the history of the people\nwho lived on this land. This same process happened\nall over the country as Europeans moved to every\ncorner of the continent. After first Americans were boxed out and lied to and relocated, the United States government\neventually settled on this. This is a map from 2020 that shows every federally\nrecognized reservation. There are 326 of them. But remember that this\nnumber leaves out the tribes that we talked about in this story. But then, later that year,\n2020, something big happened. A Supreme Court ruling found that the treaties that the US had signed with the Muskogee,\nCherokee, Choctaw, Seminole, and Chickasaw Nations, promising that they would\nleave them alone in Oklahoma, those were legitimate treaties, and that those treaties had been broken when the US government just drew all of them into\nthe state of Oklahoma. And thus, all of this land that was set aside for the five tribes during the whole relocation\nwas in fact still tribal land. So, what does that mean? Well, what it means at first is that Google\nMaps shows these borders, these borders that we've been looking at, these borders from\ntreaties in the late 1800s. But if nothing else,\nit makes crystal clear how much of a charade all of this justice was back in the day. All of the treaties, all of the legal processes,\nit was all pretend. It was a sterilized version\nof the classical imperialism that these Europeans had fled from. And yet, it was incredibly effective. I mean, the very way that I\nhave had to tell this story is proof of how effective it is, how our government policy\nsuccessfully created the concept of Native American, of Indian, hundreds, if not thousands of different\npeoples with unique cultures, languages, and histories and\nrelationships to this land, all lumped into one category on a spreadsheet, drawn into boxes. The perfect place to\ncontinue to whittle away at their distinct identities, to erase their story one\nbroken treaty at a time. (solemn piano music) (Johnny clears throat) Hey, everyone. So, this topic is way bigger than I could ever do in this video and I've struggled with\nit for a lot of years. In fact, when I was at Vox, I was gonna do a whole Borders series on reservations and first Americans, and it just felt too\ncomplicated to dive into, and I've been struggling with that. So, this and the previous\nvideo are my attempts to broach this history,\ntry to understand it, try to be sensitive to it, while also aware of how little we can do\nin a short video like this. So, if you have other stories\nthat need to be told on this, please let me know, because I want to know\nand I wanna cover more. I just wanna tell you\nabout a couple things. Number one, something\nI'm really excited about is that we have\n(poster crinkles) a giant map poster that I designed with some help from my amazing team. And it is a poster of all\nof the map projections, not all of them, dozens of them, with a little explainer\non why all maps are wrong, which is something I've been\nthinking about for years. So, go check it out. It is a way you can support our channel while also having a cool\nposter about maps in your room. Another way you can support\naround here is The Newsroom. The Newsroom is our Patreon. It just sounds way cooler\nto call it The Newsroom. And so, we call it The Newsroom. It is a place where you can go and support us while also\ngetting a couple of cool perks like an extra video every month. You get an extra video,\nwhich is a behind the scenes of how we do what we do here. We have a big team of\npeople, very talented, fun, interesting, funny people that appear in the\nbehind the scenes of vlog that publishes to Newsroom members. You get access to royalty free music from our composer, Tom Fox, and you get the warm,\nfuzzy feeling in your belly that you are supporting\nindependent journalism. So, go check that out. It's in patreon.com/johnnyharris. Also, I started a company a few years ago called Bright Trip. It's where we do smart travel\neducation, brighttrip.com.

But there's one ocean, up at the top of the world that hasn't ever been controlled by great powers because it's literally frozen most of the time. But that\u2019s changing because up here in the Arctic, things are heating up four times faster than the rest of the planet. And some big countries see a lot of money and influence hiding under the ice. There are deposits of fossil fuels. Shipping routes. And minerals. So what it's turned into is all of these countries: Russia, the United States, and even China, who's not even an Arctic country, but kind of wants to be an Arctic country. But just isn't. All of them are now vying for influence in the Arctic. Greenland belongs to the kingdom of Denmark. They are a member of the military alliance called NATO. The U.S. even has a military base up here. But Greenland is also kind of tied to China. A lot of their economy relies on sending fish to China. The result of all of this is tension. More and more every year. I actually went to Greenland to try to understand what this really important island means for the future of influence in the Arctic."

    "captions": "(dramatic music) - [Johnny] Whoever controls\nthe oceans has the power, and here in the high north, a new ocean is being born. (tense music) - I am wandering through a graveyard of American military equipment, on the largest island in the world. Like what I'm seeing here is just a bunch of American\nmilitary infrastructure that was set up during World War II, used during the Cold War, and now it's just abandoned. Like this massive dish that was a part of the Cold War defense in the\nArctic that the US used, creating a chain of radar so that if the Soviets\ninvaded from the Arctic, they would be able to detect it. And this giant dish is one\nof those radar boosters. After the Cold War, the US sold this town\nand all of its buildings back to the Greenlandic government for $1. They didn't need it anymore. That's because the world was at peace, everything was good. And the Arctic was just a frozen place, that now with the Soviet\nUnion falling apart, was not strategically that important; but, things are changing. I want to show you what this looks like, what it actually looks like on\nthe ground here in Greenland. Get you up to speed on\neverything you need to know to understand what is\ncertainly going to be one of the most important\ngeopolitical issues for years to come. - Increasing tensions. - [Male News Anchor]\nLooming war in the Arctic, as a massive military build-up, - [Female News Anchor]\nHappens in the Arctic Circle, could have far-reaching\nimplications for us all. - I'm at an airport in rural Greenland. It's like in this Fjord system, near the village of Uummannaq. And I'm realizing that I need\nto let you in on something, which is today's video is\nsponsored by Storyblocks. I've been using Storyblocks for a decade, long before I was ever a YouTuber. I was just a video maker\nand I was using Storyblocks; they used to be called Videoblocks, now they're called Storyblocks. So I'm able to go out here into the field, take all these beautiful shots, right? I'm taking all these\namazing shots of Greenland. Most of the time I'm not able to do this. This is an expensive thing, to come out here and get all these shots. Most of the time I'm in my office, making videos about the world. How do I do that? Storyblocks. Storyblocks is a giant\nrepository of visual assets, footage, templates, sound effects, that you can use to\nbring your story to life. So for me, mostly that's the footage. I go onto Storyblocks, I type in what I need and\nI get loads of results. And then the best part is, I can download unlimited clips. Like you pay one subscription and you can go buck wild and download as many clips as you want. This is a very good feeling for anyone who's had to\npay to license footage per clip, or per second. Storyblocks is just like\nyou pay a subscription, it's a very reliable, no hidden fees, reliable rate every month and you get as many clips as you want. This works for individual\ncreators that are small, big, this works for big production companies, like when I was working at production companies or different places, I would use Storyblocks. It's for creators, production\ncompanies of all sizes. I use Storyblocks all the time, and I'm really glad that they have decided to sponsor one of my videos. I've actually thought about it, I was out here shooting and I was getting all\nthis amazing drone footage and I was like, I should get some of\nthis up onto Storyblocks. So right now I've\nactually uploaded a bunch of my own clips from this trip, from Greenland, to Storyblocks. These are gorgeous clips, I'm telling you. I got some of the best footage of my life while I was here. And a bunch of that is up on Storyblocks. So, oh, and I didn't mention this, but Storyblocks also has\nAfter Effects templates, like animation templates, that you can use to start\noff your animations. I know how to do animation,\nI love animation, but I secretly use templates all the time because they make life so much easier. Oh, and they just put out this plug-in, right in Premiere and After Effects, where you can have like\nStoryblocks inside of the editor. So you're not actually going\nto a website and downloading, you're just browsing Storyblocks\ninside of the editor, which is a (emulating explosion\nnoise) like mind blowing. What is happening? Life is so much easier when you have unlimited\naccess to clips and assets right inside of your editor. So, giant fan of Storyblocks over here, really grateful that they're\nsupporting today's video. There's a link in my description, it is Storyblocks.com/JohnnyHarris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, not surprisingly, but it also shows you how\nyou can get in on this. You can go find what the\npricing looks like for you, you can go get a bunch of my clips that I've uploaded to Storyblocks, here from Greenland, and hopefully you'll\nbe a better, stronger, more versatile creator because of it. Let's get back to this story because there's a lot to cover. I have been moving through Greenland, exploring this massive island. Mostly I've been in the Fjords in these rural communities, hunting for seals and birds, riding on dog sleds, getting to know how ice works. Ice is way more complicated\nthan you can imagine and the people here know it very well. And filling in my gap of knowledge. It's a gap of knowledge that\nI think a lot of people have. Like a lot of people know Greenland for memes about how little\nis known about Greenland. Or maybe you know it as the island that is always exaggerated in its size by the Mercator map projection, but maybe that's probably just map nerds who think of it that way. But anyway, the fact is this place is not very well known or understood, but I'm telling you\nthat is about to change. The top of our planet is a giant ocean. For centuries, Empires\nwho control the oceans are the ones that had the\npower, but not up here. This ocean has always\nbeen frozen, desolate and inaccessible to powerful navies in search of power and influence. So the Arctic has remained a\ngeopolitically quiet place. This is one reason why Inuit traditions have been able to stay alive here, though that's a whole nuanced subject and I went on a deep dive in another video I made from Greenland. The fact is that things are changing. A new man-made blanket of\ncarbon is now in the air and it's been trapping more and more heat on our globe and warming it. Just a few degrees, but somehow enough to change everything. Here's what the ice up here looked like at its lowest point in the eighties, and here's what it looked like at its lowest point last year. Yeah. And this new ocean in the high north is heating four times faster\nthan the rest of the planet. And where there are liquid oceans, there will be countries looking\nto control those oceans. The new shipping routes, the\noil and gas, the minerals, and just generally the opportunity to control and influence a new place. So you've got Canada who's laying claim to the northwest passage, saying that this valuable\nnew shipping route cuts right through their\nterritory and should be theirs. You've got Russia with\nall these military bases dotting their Arctic frontier. They're also claiming all of this ocean, all the way up to the North Pole. They even put a flag on the\nocean floor a few years ago. The US is spending over a billion dollars to buy and build icebreaker\nships to patrol the Arctic. And even the rising super-power China, a non-Arctic nation, is trying to get in on\nthe influence up here. Working with their ally Russia to create an ice silk road, investing 10 billion in projects across the Nordic region. So yeah, lots of activity\nhappening all over this region, I've just scratched the surface on a few highlights here, but the fact is the Arctic\nis getting a lot of attention and one major focus is here in Greenland; a place that has been pretty\nignored by great powers. Until, that is, there's\nsomething they need or there's something to gain, which is exactly what's becoming the case as the ice melts and\nthis new ocean appears. Are you a global super power looking to project influence\nin the newly opening Arctic? Look no further than Greenland, the gateway to the Arctic Ocean. Most of Greenland, this massive island, is located conveniently\nwithin the Arctic Circle. This is why it was the\nchosen jumping-off point for Arctic explorers who were trying to be the first to reach the North Pole in the early nineteen hundreds. In fact, the US recognized\nthat this massive island was a smart geopolitical\nlocation a long time ago, convincing Greenland's colonizers to help them evict an Inuit community, so that they could put an airbase up here. The top of the world turned out to be a perfect location to traverse their growing empire and to spy on the Soviets\nduring the Cold War. They even had nuclear\nweapons up here for a time. And it wasn't just one base; over the course of the 20th century, the US set up a handful of\nmilitary bases in Greenland. They used this island to put up these massive radar systems, which would serve as early warning in case a Soviet invasion\ncame from the North. And now it just looks like a full-blown prop\nfrom a \"Star Wars\" movie. I mean, look at these. So Greenland's strategic\npotential was clear, but once the Soviet threat went away, the US mostly abandoned its presence here; though they still have\nthat base way up North and they've turned it actually into the base of their Space Force. But they eventually closed down their embassy in the capitol, and Greenland went back to being nothing really useful to the great powers. Just a frozen island at the\ndoorstep of a frozen ocean. So Greenland, this massive Arctic island at the gateway to the Arctic Ocean is now becoming much more important. That's because this ocean\nthat's always been frozen is melting more and more every year, opening it up to new trade\nroutes, to new resources, to new versions of influence\nthat can be exerted at the top of our planet. And so great powers are once again paying attention to this place, because great powers no longer see a desolate frozen island. They see opportunity, they see\nan island perfectly located close to new, enticing shipping lanes. They see an island with territorial waters full of new resources, whose territorial claims\ntheoretically extend all the way past the North Pole, incidentally overlapping\nwith Russia and Canada. They see the potential of this place being a repository of rare earth elements, the stuff we need to\nbuild modern electronics, like cell phones, computer hard drives, and electric vehicles. Suddenly this place is\nbecoming a lot more valuable in the eyes of people who want power. A fact that was highlighted by a guy who spent his life sniffing\nout real estate deals on land that was about to become valuable. - Trump wants to buy Greenland. - It's a large real estate deal. So the concept came up and I said certainly I'd be, strategically it's interesting. - Yeah, that actually happened. Boy, that was a crazy four years. I'm glad it's over. Anyway, the point is that Greenland is now getting\nloads of attention and becoming much more valuable, which brings me here, to perhaps the clearest symbol of this renewed interest in Greenland. This is the new US consulate in Nuuk. After saying they planned\nto buy the country, the Trump administration backed down after Denmark was like, hell no. Get outta here. And instead took a different approach. They ramped up efforts to build relations between Greenland and the United States, building mutual economic interests, which resulted in the opening of this consulate just in 2020. The US now has a diplomatic presence, a physical presence in Greenland; this big frozen island that no global superpower really thought was that important until recently. - I'm pleased to announce we will re-open our consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, this summer for the first time since 1953. - So this actually reminds me of a story I did a while back, when I was up in the\nArctic for Vox Borders, and I was visiting a Russian consulate on this little island. And it truly never ceases to surprise me that in an era of sophisticated alliances, and international institutions, and sophisticated military weaponry, we still resort to just putting human bodies and buildings in places that we want to have influence in, like it's a board game. Some things will never change. But as the US looks to deepen\nits ties with Greenland, so is another power,\nanother global superpower. One that incidentally is\nnowhere near the Arctic. But who knows that if they want to be the top dog on the world stage, they're gonna need a\nfoothold in this new region. - [Male News Anchor] A race for resources could lead to a boil over. - A lot of focus is placed on the Chinese, they do control a\nsignificant amount of supply. - We are so adamant that\nthese areas of the world, that are the arteries\nof trade and shipping, remain peaceful. - There is a worry of this Chinese, possible infiltration, in the country. - In 2017, Greenland wanted\nto build more airports, like the one behind me\nthat they're building. Here in Greenland, they don't have a lot of\ninfrastructure for big airplanes. So you can't get big commercial flights in and out of large\namounts of the country. You have to fly around in\nsmall planes and helicopters. Which is kind of cool if\nyou're going on an adventure, but if you're trying to\ndevelop your country, you need bigger airports. The problem is building\nairports is expensive. And no one wanted to fund this, except for: China. The prime minister of Greenland went to Beijing, their friend, and said, hey do you want to\nhelp us fund our new airports? China was like, yes, we will give you a loan\nto fund the airports, but it has to be a Chinese\nconstruction company that builds the airports. And Greenland was like, okay, let's do it. That sounds great. And immediately over in the United States, alarm bells start going off. This is not good. The context here is that China has a habit of giving loans to countries that they want to have influence in, in the future. They do this a lot in Africa, like they give loans, knowing that they now have leverage over all of these countries who now owe them money. Anyway, so the United States sees this potential deal happening between Greenland and China and hates it. Greenland, this place that\nis so strategically located, that is right next to the United States, that is really a huge part of the future of global influence in the Arctic, suddenly in debt to China? No! In fact, the Pentagon freaked out and was like, what if Greenland defaults\non their payments to China and China seizes the airports and starts using it for their military? Little bit of an alarmist\ndoomsday scenario, but it's true. Like when you owe someone money, they have leverage over you. The US did not like this. So the US goes to Denmark and\ntells them to kill the deal. Denmark does it, they agree. And suddenly Denmark is now funding two thirds of these airport projects. China got rejected on these airport deals thanks to US pressure, but they didn't give up. They started setting their sights on those rare earth minerals that we talked about earlier. The vital ingredients for your phone, your computer and your electric car. China holds a near monopoly on mining and processing these minerals. So they see Greenland as an opportunity to continue that near monopoly, but also an opportunity\nto access the Arctic; another place where they can\ncompete with Western interests. It started when this Chinese corporation made a deal to fund a zinc and lead mine in the far north of Greenland. It was all going to plan until the Australian owners of this mine suddenly decided to end their deal. Oh, and shortly thereafter, they got a 650 million dollar cheque from the United States\nto fund the project. Once again, the US blocked their rival from getting a foothold in the Arctic. Another Chinese company has had their mining licenses revoked entirely by the government of Greenland. So between this diplomatic pressure, as well as some local\nanti-mining political sentiment, China has been blocked time and time again from getting its foothold on this island. - China's words and actions raised doubts about its intentions. Beijing claims to be a near-Arctic state, yet the shortest distance between China and the Arctic is 900 miles. - So yeah, the USA has\nmade its stance very clear that they don't want\nChina, a non-Arctic nation, to be meddling in this region, to be gaining a foothold in\nthe gateway to the Arctic; this region that is opening up, that is becoming really important. And in addition to\nblocking China's efforts, the US has also stepped\nup their own efforts to get more US influence\nand presence in this place. To prepare for the future\nof geopolitical conflict. The US is doing investments on its own, investing billions of dollars in military infrastructure in this region, including a $4 billion upgrade of that air and space\ninstallation in the north. They're also committing to military training exercise within the Arctic. The US Army has been\nsending their soldiers to train in Arctic-like conditions, to mimic what conflict might look and feel like in the high North. The US government is offering millions of dollars in\naid directly to Greenland, to help them develop their\nmining and tourism sectors. So yeah, once again, we see the struggle for influence playing out between great powers in all of these kind of\nhard-to-see battlefields. Loans, infrastructure,\nblocking trade deals, diplomatic pressure, military presence. This is kind of the\nflavor of modern conflict. I mean, not the Russian\nflavor of modern conflict, but like the great powers conflict plays out in these other ways, these hard-to-see ways, these\nbureaucratic systematic ways. But who cares about these big superpowers and what they want for Greenland? I came to the capitol, Nuuk, to talk to my friend Qupanuk about what Greenlanders actually want. After all, this is their island. They should decide how\nit's used and by whom. - We are not just looking at the western world through Denmark anymore, but we are seeing more globally. So we are starting to realize, more and more, how lucky we actually are. - That's super interesting. It turns out that about\nhalf of Greenlanders actually think it's a good thing that China is increasing in its power and influence around the globe. But when you ask them specifically about China investing in Greenland, they're more hesitant, with nearly 70% saying that they oppose foreign investment from China. But a country like Greenland, which has such a fraught\nhistory with colonizers, also has reservations about\nWestern interests here too. - And a lot of injustices have been, and are still, being done in colonial and de-colonial nations. More and more things are\njust being shown now, because people are more\naware of their rights, and more aware of the rights\nthat are being violated. - [Johnny] So Greenlanders are waking up to their power in this situation, waking up to the leverage that they have in this new global competition. And while they might have their concerns about China and the West, they're looking for the\nbest deal for their country. - The first ones must\nbe our closest friends and like-minded nations. And then if other countries want to invest in\nGreenland and in our way, we are open for business. - [Johnny] So as we move into this new era of great power competition, the map is changing in unexpected ways. Add to that the warming globe that is creating a new ocean, and suddenly this island so often forgotten by great powers, is now in a position of leverage. - There are many Greenlandic people who haven't realized\nhow powerful we can be. How much is like, I don't know how small\nDenmark is without Greenland. It like it's a tiny, tiny country, if they didn't have us. we should be more aware of it and be more proud of it and realize how powerful we\ncan actually be in the future. (contemplative music)"

    "video_id": "Z3D6pGc7nHw",
    "captions": "(slurping sounds) - All right, let's do this. Check this out. On September 19th, 2008, Republican Congressman\nSpencer Bachus made a trade that was effectively a bet that\nthe stock market would drop. His trade meant that for\nevery percentage point that the NASDAQ dropped, his\ninvestment would go up by 200%. This is what's known\nas shorting the market, and it was actually a brilliant bet, because take a look what\nhappens over the next four days. (intense upbeat music) Oh, and this is when he sells, nearly doubling his investment. It was an amazing trade. It was almost as if he\ncould see the future. Wait, what's this? Ah, the day before he made this trade, Bachus was sitting in a room in a private meeting\nwith the top officials of the US Treasury and Fed. The meeting was so secret that everyone had to hand over their phone\nbefore entering the room. The people that Bachus was meeting with were the ones who were\nin charge of making sure that everything was under\ncontrol in the US economy. But this was September, 2008 and things were not under control. - This could be the most\nserious recession in decades. - So in this meeting,\nBachus was told that quote, it was a matter of days\nbefore there was going to be a meltdown in the global financial system. - Let's talk about the speed with which we are watching this market deteriorate. - We're down over 16%. - Okay, so that explains why he was able to make\nthis brilliant trade. He knew when the market\nwas about to crash, because he had intel from within. But what's crazy is that\nBachus's short on the market wasn't breaking any rules. It was totally legal. Luckily, we have financial disclosures, all of the stocks that\nlawmakers buy and sell, public information. So we can see who's making trades based on insider information. And we've used all of this information to make a list for you, a list of the lawmakers that we see as some of the best\ninvestors in our country. And in this video, I want to explain how their insider knowledge may help them make the best bets on Wall Street. - [Reporter] There's all sorts of insider trading happening in Congress. - [Male Reporter] That's\nbecause they're corrupt. They wanna keep making money\nfrom that inside trading. - [Reporter 2] The\nAmerican people should know that a member of Congress is never leaving a classified briefing and calling their stockbroker. (intense music) - So, we in the West\nlove a good free market, buy, sell, and invest as you please. But, for certain people who\nhave special insider information about the economy, we have rules to stop them from gaming the\nsystem with their knowledge. We passed these laws like a century go. They're called insider trading laws. - Insider trading. - Insider trading. - Basically, they prohibit people from selling an investment like stocks, using non-public information. This includes tipping\nthis info to other people who then go buy the stocks based on that insider information. And an insider is anyone who is an officer or director or 10% stakeholder, or anyone who possesses\ninsider information, because of his or her\nrelationship with a company. This could be like the daughter of a CEO who has insider information, because she talked to her\ndad around the dinner table about what the company's gonna do next. So if you're the CEO of Microsoft, you're not allowed to\nsell a bunch of your stock the day before you\nrelease an earnings report that shows that your\ncompany's profits are down, which will likely trigger like\na drop in the stock price. A free market needs to\nbe a fair market too, so that the insiders\naren't always the ones with the knowledge to\nmake the best trades. Okay, so while insider\ntrading laws are very clear when it comes to business executives, there's a group of people in our society to whom these rules kind\nof don't apply, lawmakers. - Historically, Congress\nhas had no restrictions when it comes to trading stocks. For most of American history, insider trading laws that affected CEOs, didn't apply to members of Congress. - Lawmakers hear loads\nof private information. They sit on committees,\nwhere they investigate and talk to businesses all the time. This stuff affects the economy\nand thus the stock market. And a lot of it is private. They know this stuff\nbefore the rest of us do. And yet, for most of our history\nhere in the United States, lawmakers have been able\nto buy and sell stocks with very little restriction, (crowd applauds) and that is why this report exists. (smacking sounds) This brilliant study\nrecreates all of the trades that senators made over the\ncourse of four years in the 90s and found that consistently\nthese senators had abnormal positive returns, like way better than some of the best investors in our country. - [Narrator] A study\nof data from the 1990s showed senators' trades\noutperformed the market by 12% per year. That crushes investment\nguru Warren Buffett, who only managed to beat the\nmarket by 2.5% that decade. - Hmm, okay. So either these civil servants are just like super savvy investors, or as the study suggests, the senators knew the appropriate time to buy and sell their common stocks. Like we're all kind of guessing when we're playing the stock market, everyone's guessing\nwhat's gonna happen next. If you kind of know\nwhat's gonna happen next, because you're like privy to\ninformation about the economy, you can play the game a lot better. (cheerful music) Thank you BetterHelp, for\nsponsoring today's video. I'm a massive believer in therapy. Therapy has transformed my life and I believe that everyone needs therapy. I don't think it's like a thing that is for people who have\nclinical mental health issues, though it's obviously useful for that. But all of us who live and\nhave relationships and feelings and good days and bad days could use a professional to speak to and learn about how our minds work and learn how to see and\nunderstand our thought processes. That's what therapy is. BetterHelp is a platform\nthat makes therapy more accessible to people. Finding a therapist is difficult, I mean you have to like call around, see if it works with your\ninsurance, go to an office, wait. BetterHelp uses technology to get rid of all of those barriers. What you do is you sign\nup, you take a quick quiz and then BetterHelp\nmatches you with someone in their massive network of\nlike tens of thousands of licensed professional therapists that you can start\ncommunicating with immediately, like within a few days. You can do a video call,\nyou can do a phone call, you could even just do\ntexting back and forth. Regardless of how you do it, you are communicating with\na professional therapist and you are starting your journey towards increased mental health, which is something I deeply believe in. Often it takes a moment to\nfind the best therapist. So the best part is if you\nget matched with a therapist that isn't a good fit for you, you can change immediately for no cost and they'll just find you someone else in their huge network of therapists, until you find the right person.

Let's dive back into our list. - If we were trading stocks\nbased on insider info, we'd go to prison. They don't go to prison. This happens out in the open. - And then, as banks in the stock market were collapsing in 2008, lawmakers once again made headlines with their surprisingly successful and suspiciously timed trades. In 2012, the Washington Post did a big investigation into this and found that in the lead\nup to the 2008 meltdown, had least 34 lawmakers from\nboth sides of the aisle, changed portions of their portfolios, 166 times within two business days of speaking with administration officials. So many of these lawmakers\nare making loads of money while the economy is\nmelting down around them. When asked about their shady transactions, lawmakers such as John Boehner quote, declined to discuss their transactions. After this blatant display\nof insider knowledge, it became more and more\nclear that lawmakers were using their knowledge\nto enrich themselves. And it was not a great look at a time when millions of Americans were losing their life\nsavings and jobs and houses. - It was the worst day on Wall Street, since the crash of 1987. - Oh, but remember, it was still legal. They weren't breaking any rules. It was their right to do this. But the pressure mounted. And in 2012, they passed\na law on themselves. We have an act of Congress. Look at this. 112th Congress passing laws\nto regulate their own greed. I love this. I love this. - The idea that everybody\nplays by the same rules is one of our most\ncherished American values. - Oh, and look at the name of the law. This is the Stop Trading on\nCongressional Knowledge Act. The Stock Act, pretty clever. This law bans Congress from\nbuying and selling stocks based on insider information and requires them to publish\nall of their trading activity, which is one reason why\nI have all of this paper. They're like now required to disclose all of their stock trading. Great, 2012, they passed the law. Problem solved, right? Well no, not according to our reporting. Despite this law, we still have a list that I'm now about to show you. (upbeat music) This is a list of all the lawmakers who went on to continue to make\nsavvy trades in the market, all while still being totally clued in to private and privileged\ninformation about the economy. (intense upbeat music) Okay, first up, we've got\nthe financial disclosure of Republican Senator Richard\nBurr from North Carolina. (ominous music) In January, 2020, before\nany of us really knew that the world was literally\nabout to shut down, Burr was the chairman of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee. On January 24th, he together\nwith a bunch of senators were briefed on secret information about how bad the Coronavirus pandemic really was about to get. And according to this\nunsealed FBI document, a few days later, Burr discussed some of that non-public information that he had learned in the\nbriefing with someone via text. Who was that someone? Their name was, redacted. We don't know, because it's an FBI thing. Doesn't matter. What we do know is that\nminutes after this call, Burr logs into his trading account and sells $110,000 worth of stocks. (upbeat music) That same day, literally\nat 3:43 that same day, right after he sells his\nstocks, like a few hours later, the White House comes out and says that they're going\nto ban people from traveling to the United States if\nthey've been to China in the last 14 days. Soon after selling all of his stocks, Senator Burr writes an op-ed for Fox News claiming that the US is quote, better prepared than ever to\nface the Coronavirus threat. And yet Burr continues to sell his stocks. This is his disclosure\nfrom February of 2020 and the guy's going kind of nuts on sales. All of this whole entire\nrow are all sales. This guy is selling, sell, sell, sell. (intense upbeat music) In this time period, Burr moved over a million\ndollars from stocks into Treasury securities, which is an investment that is super safe during an economic downturn. But what was crazy is\nthat the stock market was at an all-time high and he just sold essentially\nall of his stocks. And then look what happens. (upbeat music) And while he was downplaying the severity of the pandemic in public, in private, he was spilling the beans like in this secret\nrecording of obtained by NPR, where Burr is telling a\ngroup of his social club. - [Richard] There's one thing that I can tell you about this, it is much more aggressive\nin its transition than anything that we have\nseen in recent history. It's probably more akin\nto the 1918 pandemic. - According to an\ninvestigation by ProPublica, Burr also passed his private info to his brother-in-law in a call\nthat lasted only 50 seconds. And the very next minute, his brother-in-law called up his broker and dumped between 97,000 and\n280,000 US dollars in shares. I mean, if this isn't insider\ntrading, I don't know what is. And yet it's impossible to prove anything. Burr himself might even be convinced that this wasn't insider trading and that he's just a really smart investor and that he did all of this based on publicly available information. And indeed the SEC and\nDepartment of Justice investigated this, but\nultimately dropped the matter. Oh, and fun fact, Burr is\nlike one of three senators who voted against the insider\ntrading law, the Stocks Act. So yeah, we know where he stands. Okay, that was kind of a longer one. Not all of them are\ngonna be that in depth. Next up, we've got this\nmonstrosity of a document. We are looking at the financial disclosure of Congressman Ro Khanna from California. (upbeat music) Look at this, it's like\ndozens and dozens of pages and they are effectively unreadable. (intense music) What's the point of disclosing\nyour financial transactions if no one can read them? These disclosures show that since 2019, Congressman Khanna's family\nhas made at least 10,500 trades involving nearly 900 companies. Oof, it's quite a few. Okay, like not a crime\nto make a lot of trades. What's the deal? A lot of these trades,\nmost of these trades were done through a trust that belongs to like his wife and kids. - Well, it's not, I don't trade at all. I'm up for banning trade. It's my wife's money, which I have no actual legal rights to. - But, when you look at what companies are being bought and sold, you see that of the 897\ncompanies traded by his family, 149 of them were ones that Khanna likely had non-public information about, because of his role as a congressman who sits on a bunch of committees. Like for example, he sits on\nthe House Oversight Committee, which is a committee that\nhas directly investigated drug prices for companies like AbbVie, at the same time that his wife\nwas trading in AbbVie stock. You're right, it was his wife, not him. But you see, you see this is not okay. And this wasn't the only one. The New York Times did an investigation that found loads of instances\nwhere Khanna's wife and kids were trading in companies that were being actively\ninvestigated by Khanna himself, at the same time. Examples include weapon manufacturers, like Lockheed Martin, big pharma companies,\nlike Johnson and Johnson. Yes, technically it was his\nwife and kids doing it, not him. But come on, this feels\nkind of like a blurry line, but it also feels really clear like you shouldn't be able to trade stock if your husband is\ninvestigating the company that you're trading stock in. Also, these are his children. Like, they're not the ones deciding what stocks they're gonna buy and sell. So yeah, feels off to me. But again, there's no way to prove this. There's no like direct\nsmoking Ganesh type thing that's like, this is insider trading. Anyway, let's move on. (cheerful music) And then there is\nCongresswoman Nancy Pelosi, a democrat from California who served as Speaker\nof the House for years. Speaker of the House is a\nrole that has major influence on what laws get through our system. Nancy Pelosi is also\nmarried to an investor. So yeah, the story told in\nthese financial disclosures is one of Nancy Pelosi being married to a very, very good investor, especially during financial\nturmoil in America. (upbeat music) In the two years following\nthe 2008 financial crisis, the Pelosis' estimated net worth grew from $31 million\nto over a $100 million. That's up 220%, all while\nthe S and P 500 fell by 13%. The Pelosis also did super\nwell during the pandemic, seeing their net worth jump from a $106 million to $171 million, within in like the two\nyears of the pandemic, that's an increase of\n60% during the pandemic. And I mean, listen, like\nlet's be fair on this. I'm sure Paul Pelosi is a\nfantastic, savvy investor, and there's frankly no evidence of foul play or anything\ninsider trading here, but there doesn't have to be. The very fact that a professional investor lives in the same home as the woman who is at the center of the American legal and regulatory system, presents a major conflict\nof interest, in my opinion. But I know it's tricky because I believe that people should be\nable to do what they want with their money. But when we pay our lawmakers\nto handle special information, it feels off to me when\nsuddenly those lawmakers are making bank during\nfinancial meltdowns. But it's not just these\nfinancial meltdowns and recessions where they do well. The Pelosis sold $3 million\nworth of Google stock, just a few weeks before the DOJ announced that it was suing Google\nfor anti-trust reasons, like right before their stock tanked. (upbeat music) Did Pelosis know that the\nDOJ was going to investigate? Do we know? No, we don't know. But the timing was fishy. And besides, there's\nplenty more examples here. Like when Paul Pelosi bought millions of dollars of Tesla stock, while his wife was passing laws that would directly\nimpact the value of Tesla, like major taxpayer sponsored\nelectric car subsidies. Or when he dumped millions\nof dollars of Nvidia stock, days before the US government announced that it would restrict chip makers from trading with China and Russia. I mean, the Pelosi investor-lawmaker combo has been so successful that people have started\ncopying their trades. - Oh man, Nancy Pelosi's back at it again. You know what they say, \"you wanna see how to be\nsuccessful in trading stocks? Just watch what Nancy Pelosi is doing\". - She literally locked\nin a 20% gain for you, because it sold when she sold. - She's like a meme within\nthe investor community because of this. And when a journalist asked\nher in a press conference about these allegations of insider trading or if this should be banned,\nthis was her response. - No, to the second one. (reporters mumbling) Because this is a free market and people, we are a free market economy, they should be able to\nparticipate in that. - And I mean, yes, she's right. This is a free market economy. People should be able to do\nwhat they want with their money, even if they are civil servants who frankly do a difficult job every day. But a free market is not a fair market if some people, especially civil servants are operating with information\nthat affects the market and using that information to get rich. But again, all of this is legal. Like no one's breaking any\nrules here, at least overtly. You can't prove that a law was broken. And even if you could, the only people who have the\npower to really change it and enforce this are the people who are making money off\nof the lobbying really lax. More on that in a second, but\nlet's get back to our list. - [Female Reporter]\nRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once again defending her\ncontroversial rhetoric. - Next up, we've got\nRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. She's number 12 on the best performing stock investors in our Congress. So naturally, we had to take a look. On February 22nd, 2022,\na little over a year ago, Greene invested in Lockheed Martin, which is a defense contractor, and Chevron, which is a giant oil company. The next day, she puts out this tweet, war and rumors of war is incredibly profitable and convenient. Okay, and then the day after\nthat, Russia invades Ukraine. Her investment in a defense\ncontractor and an oil giant. It made her a good amount of money. But who knows, could have\nbeen a whole coincidence or could have been public information. We all kind of knew that Putin\nwas thinking of invading. It's all technically legal and unprovable. But, if you wanna go\ndown another rabbit hole on how lawmakers profit from war and the military industrial complex, check out our video on who got rich off the war in Afghanistan. Anyway, moving on. (cheerful music) Next up, we've got Kelly Loeffler, former Senator from Georgia. Loeffler was also in that private CDC Senate Health Committee briefing that her colleague Richard Burr attended. And look, the next day she's\ntweeting out her thanks for this wonderful briefing. What you've forgot to mention was that within hours of the meeting, she and her husband\nsold off between 50,000 and a $100,000 of stocks. (buzzer chimes) And then, according to\nher financial disclosures in the following weeks, she sold somewhere between 1.2\nand $3.1 million in stocks, right before the big market\ncrash on February 20th. (bell chimes) (upbeat music) Like, do you realize it's\nthe same exact thing? She had a head start. She had information that none of us had about how bad this really was and she was able to sell all of her stuff at the right time. Like Senator Burr, she was\ninvestigated for a while, but nothing ever came of it. I mean, it's kind of tricky like, should Senator Kelly Loeffler\nlike not sell her stocks ever, even if the economy's melting\ndown and we all know it? Like should she be forced\nto hold on to her stocks? I don't think that's right either. There are some good solutions to this and we'll get to them in a sec. But let's move on to\nSenator Dianne Feinstein. (ominous music) Who was also in that\nroom in January of 2020, getting briefed on how bad\nthe pandemic was about to be. And like others, right after the briefing, she dumped a bunch of stocks like somewhere between 1.5 and $6 million. Man, these senators have a\nlot of cash lying around. The FBI questioned Feinstein about this and she said that she had\nno influence over this, that it was her husband\nwho did the trading and that it was all just\nimpeccably timed all by himself. No dinner table conversations about today's briefing with the CDC. No pillow talk, nothing, lips sealed. Honey, how was your day at work today? Good, but I can't tell you about it because it was a privileged briefing because you might go off\nand sell all of our stocks and avoid us losing hundreds\nof thousands of dollars, 'cause the market's\nprobably gonna crash soon. So I'm just gonna stay totally quiet, because the Stocks Act says so. Like no, I'm not saying that Feinstein told her husband to sell stocks. I'm saying that it's absurd to\nthink that a husband and wife don't talk about everything\nin a normal conversation and a conversation that\nwould probably be laced with inadvertent, insider information that maybe as benign sounding\nas an update on your day or how your day at work was. It's just a natural conflict of interest. And yes, the FBI backed off and closed the investigation like they did for everybody else. Okay, let's get to one\nmore case on our list. This is by no means a comprehensive list of everyone who has had\nsuspicious timed trades. It's just sort of our highlights. And this is the last but not least. (upbeat music) Former Senator David Perdue, who traded 2,596 times in a single term. The New York Times did this\ngreat deep dive on those trades and found that he regularly\nbought and sold stocks in companies that fell under\nthe Senate Oversight Committee, which he was on. One very clear example\nin all of this is 2016, Perdue made a bunch of trades\nin a company called FireEye. It's a cybersecurity company that had, oh, landed a 30 million contract with the federal government. It operates out of Purdue's\nhome state of Georgia, and most of these trades in this company happened while he was sitting\non the cybersecurity panel, a role that could easily\ngive him non-public industry and business information\nabout companies like FireEye, which he owned stock in. Two years later, Perdue reported that he made up to $15,000 off of his investment in FireEye. He also traded in a bunch\nof financial institutions, like JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, while he was supposed\nto be overseeing them as a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. Like conflict of interest,\nregulating the companies that you are personally invested in. Like it's so clear I don't\neven have to explain like it's. Okay, well that's it. So this is all pretty\nfrustrating and like not right, but wait, what happened to the Stocks Act? Like, what? Where's that law? Remember the Stocks Act? Remember this, 2012? Didn't they like pass a law that said, you're not allowed to do this anymore? Kind of. - Lately, I've been talking\na lot about the choices facing this country. We can settle for a\ncountry that in the economy where a shrinking number of\npeople do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by or we can build an economy\nwhere everybody gets a fair shot and everybody plays by\nthe same set of rules. - It turns out that while\nthe acronym is very strong, the legislation is incredibly weak. - It's certainly illegal\nfor members of Congress to partake in insider trading. Proving that is very difficult. - Second, even if you\ndo get caught in this, like not disclosing or\nsharing insider information, the fine is laughable. - As a lawmaker, you don't face any real\nsignificant penalty for violating the Stock\nAct, if you ultimately do, particularly the disclosure provision, - Theoretically, it's supposed to be like 15 years in prison. But in all of our research, not a single lawmaker has\nfaced any consequences. Even though there's been\nat least 78 instances where Congress has violated\nthe law very overtly. - You can make tens of millions of dollars with privilege information\nand what's the penalty for failing to report these purchases? It's a joke. It's as low as $200. - The Stocks Act was\nnever going to prevent members of Congress from\nmaking a few extra dollars here and there with their\ninsider information. - We have a free market economy. They should be able to\nparticipate in that. - But here's the thing, lawmakers themselves know\nthat this is a problem. Like this is not a good look. - But I'm actually for\nbanning stock trading. - Members of Congress\nshould not be selling individual stocks, put\nit in a blind trust, trade in mutual funds. - But it's not really\nhappening anytime soon and it's not hard to see why. I mean, we're talking about Congress having to regulate Congress. - The Speaker put forth\nreally a bill destined to fail and the speaker has employed\nstall tactic after stall tactic in order to kind of keep delaying what's potentially a vote on any bill that would ban members of\nCongress from selling stocks. (intense music) - The tragedy in all of this to me is that both our financial markets, as well as our entire\ndemocracy and society are held together by a very important and delicate thing called trust. - If we expect that to apply\nto our biggest corporations and to our most successful citizens, it certainly should apply\nto our elected officials, especially at a time when\nthere's a deficit of trust, between this city and\nthe rest of the country. - A democracy can only function if we trust the people running it. And stuff like this, even if technically no rules were broken in an evidence-based way,\nthat undermines trust, it looks really bad. In January, a republican senator who was feeling very snarky, introduced the prevent election leaders from owning securities\nand investments act, which spells Pelosi. The Pelosi Act. Man, if there's one thing\nthat our elected officials seem to be good at, it's these acronyms that have like really fun optics, but like don't actually do anything. What this says to me is, \"no, nothing's going to change\", but it just shows the fact\nthat we can like create a meme out of Nancy Pelosi and then dog pile over how\ninsider trading this all looks, even if there is no\nwrongdoing technically, that's the problem. The optics are the problem. Trust in our democracy is delicate and the optics actually matter. Trust matters. When we erode that trust,\nwe erode our democracy. - If you, for example, are\ndriving down the highway and you're going 55 miles an hour, but it's a 30 mile an hour zone and you know you're only\ngonna get a $5 ticket, well you might be driving 55 a lot. (upbeat music) - What do I do with all this paper now? Hopefully recycle it. Paper's very, very useful for\nme to understand information, so I do a lot of printing. Anyway, thank you all for\nwatching today's video. I wanna tell you about a couple things. Number one, this poster that I designed with a bunch of map projections on it, this is something I've\nthought about for years. I'm very excited to finally\nlaunch it to the world. It is a map poster about\nwhy all maps are wrong and it is these beautiful projections on this really nice paper. It's just kind of a fun\nart piece for map nerds if you're into that. Also, we have LUTs and presets. If you are interested in\ncoloring your photos or videos, you can do that with our LUTs and presets. That is what we use to color our stuff. I should also tell you about\nour community over on Patreon called the Newsroom. The Newsroom is a place\nwhere the community supports the journalism we are doing here. We are a big operation now. That is why we are able\nto publish so often. And to do this kind of work, we more and more rely on the\ncommunity to help support us. So, thank you patrons\nover at the Newsroom. Newsroom members get a\nnew video every month that is only available to patrons. It is a behind the scenes vlog of just how we do what\nwe do here in the studio. You also get access to my scripts, and a bunch of other things. But more importantly, you are here, a part of this ongoing\ndiscussion we're having about how the world works\nand trying to be smarter and trying to be more informed and trying to be critical\nthinkers in this day and age of lots of information, some\nof it true, some of it not. So thank you for being here. Thank you for watching and I\nwill talk to you soon, bye. (ominous music)"

    "title": "Why Sudan is on the Verge of Civil War",
    "video_id": "bl9HEcfq1Oc",
    "captions": "- [Narrator] Sudan is\nmoving towards a civil war as violence rises in the capitol. Two rival generals and their armies are fighting for control\nin the city of Khartoum, and the battle is spreading\nacross the country. - $3 billion in aid is needed to help Sudan's refugee crisis. Around a million people\nhave been displaced after intense fighting\nbroke out a month ago. - [Narrator] So let me get you up to speed on what's happening here, and show you how Sudan's\nlocation here near the Suez Canal in the Horn of Africa makes\nit geopolitically important, which is one reason why faraway countries are watching this conflict\nand preparing to get involved, to secure their interests, and\nto influence the next chapter of this country's history. - Fighting broke out\nin Sudan in mid-April. We've seen it on the\nstreets and in the sky. - Daring evacuation of the\nAmerican Embassy in Sudan. More than 400 people have\ndied close to 4,000 wounded. - And a watching world is asking, \"What's happening in Sudan?\" - Before we dive into this story, which I'm very excited to share with you, I need to thank the\nsponsor of today's video, which is a service I have\nbeen using a lot lately. It is called Incogni and\nit is a game changer. For years I have been in\na war with data brokers. Data brokers are companies that you don't know anything about, you've never heard of, but\nthey operate behind the scenes, and they know a lot about you and me. They make a business out\nof scrubbing the internet for information about us, and then they sell that\ninformation to corporations who then use that\ninformation to market to us. Data brokers are the reason that my phone is always getting spammed. Data brokers are the\nreason that my email inbox is a nightmare. Data brokers are the reason that my mailbox is full of junk mail. I feel so violated by all of this and I want to be done with it, and that's what Incogni does. Incogni understands how the\nwhole data broker world works. It's intentionally very\nopaque, Incogni understands it. And it's super easy,\nyou sign up with them, you give them permission\nto act on your behalf, to go unsubscribe you\nfrom the hundreds of lists that you are probably on, the lists that have your\nbirthday, and your phone number, and your preferences. No more. I've been spending a lot of\ntime on the Incogni dashboard where you can see all of the data brokers that you're being unsubscribed to. Incogni deletes your personal information from dozens of data brokers. The fact is we all have rights\nto not be on these lists, but none of us know how to actually do it because it's incredibly\ncomplicated by design. So I'm proud to say that\nsince I signed up for Incogni, I have been taken off of\ndozens of these lists. With the yearly subscription, you get Incogni to constantly monitor your name and your private information on the open market of data brokers, constantly scrubbing to take\nit off whenever they see it. There's a link in my description. It is incogni.com/JohnnyHarris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gets you a\nsweet discount on Incogni. 60% off when you sign up using that link. With the annual plan they're\nconstantly monitoring to make sure that your\nname doesn't make it back on these lists. I'm very happy. Thank you Incogni for\nsponsoring today's video and for existing. I didn't know you existed until\nyou came to sponsor a video, and I'm very grateful you exist. Okay, let's get back to the video. I'm excited to share with you this story. Sudan has been in conflict\nsince its founding with the first civil war starting a year before they gained\nindependence from the British. - [Reporter] The country's independence had just been officially\nrecognized by Britain and Egypt. - [Narrator] The fighting has\noften been between the north and the south, fighting over\ncontrol, over representation. And because Sudan has oil and gold, these conflicts have always\nattracted outsiders looking to support the side that\nwould serve their interests. The conflict today has a lot to do with the actions of one\nman, Omar Al-Bashir. A Sudanese Army colonel who\ntook over the government in a bloodless coup in the late 80's. During the country's second civil war, he quickly dissolved\nthe Sudanese parliament, he banned political parties.,\nhe introduced Islamic law, and became a military dictator. And in order to secure his\npower and fend off opposition, he assembled a group of militias here in the west of the country to make his own personal military force. This military force was led by a commander nicknamed Hemedti. So by the early 2000's, Sudan's dictator commands two armies, the Sudanese Armed Forces,\nbut also this special unit of loyal fighters that he\nassembled from these militias. He uses this force to stamp\nout whoever he needs to in order to stay in power, especially over here in the Darfur region where non-Arab groups felt\nneglected by the government and wanted to break away. But Al-Bashir uses his\nspecial military force to massacre these rebels, leading to the mass murder\nof hundreds of thousands, and displacing millions\nof people in the process. Al-Bashir eventually\nrebranded his personal army to be called the Rapid Support Forces, and it wasn't just an army. A trove of leaked bank and\ncorporate document show that this army is also a\nlucrative business empire that captures goldmines,\nruns smuggling operations, patrols the borders, and\nprovides its fighters for hire in regional conflict, and facilitates a profitable\ngold trade with foreign powers like Russia and the United Arab Emirates. One document details the\ndelivery of $30 million worth of gold bars from Sudan to Dubai from the company owned by Hemedti, the leader of this army. And this is a key part of this story because in addition to helping Al-Bashir, the dictator, stay in power, the RSF also made this\nwarlord, Hemedti, super rich because he was able to use his\ntens of thousands of soldiers to control both the gold market\nand the borders of Sudan. Okay, so it's 2005. The conflict in Darfur\nis just getting started, but the civil war that has\nbeen raging for decades between the north and the\nsouth comes to an end. By 2011, its result is a formal division. South Sudan finally breaks away and becomes the world's newest country. - [Reporter] A nation is born. A symbol of sovereignty and identity flies for the first time. - [Narrator] But with them they take 75% of the oil reserves, a major\nblow to Sudan's economy. So inflation runs wild, food prices rise, and Al-Bashir doesn't have enough money to continue his system\nof bribes and tributes to political elites in the military. The quality of life in Sudan plummets, and by 2019 they had had enough. All over the country, the\npeople take to the streets and protest their dictator\ndemanding democracy. The Sudanese Army and the RSF, these two separate military organizations, both see what's coming. They team up and overthrow\nAl-Bashir sending him to prison and taking over the government. It was the end of 2019 and\nOmar Al-Bashir's 30 years of dictatorship drew to a close. And now, the Sudanese Army leader, General Abdel Fattah\nAl-Burhan, was in charge, closely followed by the RSF\nwarlord billionaire, Hemedti. They're cooperating in this transition and they promise the protestors that they will eventually\nhand the country over to a civilian leader who\nwill bring in a democracy. But the military leaders keep\ngoing back on their promise. They keep ruling the country for years, and they continuously abuse\nand massacre the protestors. This all comes to a head in December 2022 when Al-Burhan agrees\nto indeed give control of the government back to the civilians, but he has one big condition. He wants the RSF to no longer\nbe an independent military. He wants it to be folded into\nthe official Sudanese Army, so that he would control it, not Hemedti, and this is where a\nconflict starts to brew. Hemedti, this warlord\nwho has made hundreds of millions of dollars thanks\nto his command over this army doesn't like this idea. He's not gonna let his lucrative\nbusiness military empire get swallowed by the government, so he decides that he only has one choice to overthrow the government\nand lead the country himself. (speaking in foreign language) On April 15th, 2023, Hemedti\nsends 2,000 of his men to Al-Burhan's personal residence, which is a military compound. It leads to a shootout\nwhere 35 guards are killed. Al-Burhan narrowly escapes,\nbut the conflict spreads throughout the capitol of Khartoum and the country as a whole. These two forces that the\nprevious dictator used for different purposes now fighting over who will rule the country. Tanks roll through the city and airstrikes boom in\nresidential neighborhoods. Embassies empty as foreign countries evacuate their citizens. But for many Sudanese civilians, a quick escape isn't an option. There are no helicopter rescues, no international convoys coming for them. So they pack up and leave their\nhomes fleeing the conflict and heading to neighboring\ncountries, Egypt, Chad, or South Sudan. And soon this conflict that looks like it's just between these\nmilitary generals struggling for control is actually turning into a war that the rest of the world has an eye on. Sudan is a geo strategically\nimportant country. It sits a stride the Nile,\nwhich is the lifeline to Egypt. It's home to these ports\nnear the vital choke points of our global economy, the Suez\nCanal in the Horn of Africa, where 10% of world trade passes through including huge amounts of oil. Powerful countries around the globe are always trying to\nput military bases here. They want to control\nbases and ports simply because of its vital\nimportance for global trade. Sudan is also loaded with\nresources, gold, zinc, silver, chromite, and iron. This is stuff that foreign\ncountries want and need. So powerful countries are watching this military commander showdown and evaluating who they should support, who will best secure their\ninterests in the future. - [Reporter] Gunfire in\nSudan's capital, Khartoum, fractured Friday start. - [Narrator] The United Arab Emirates is a huge player in all of this. They buy and refine the\nmajority of Sudan's gold, and a lot of it comes from Hemedti and his military business empire. The UAE has also paid Hemedti\nto use some of his soldiers to fight on their side in Yemen. So there's this mutually\nbeneficial alignment and relationship between these two. But the Sudanese Armed Forces\nalso have fought in Yemen in recent years, and\nthe UAE has made deals with the military\ngovernment to secure ports and access to minerals. So the UAE is now in a situation where they've bolstered both\nsides of this now conflict. And then there's Libya, where\nthis warlord Khalifa Haftar has strong connections to Hemedti. Hemedti has also loaned\nout some of his fighters to go to Libya to fight on Haftar's side. So now Haftar is returning the favor, supporting his warlord ally\nby sending fuel shipments to the RSF. Haftar is really important in all of this because if other countries\nlike the UAE do decide to send money or weapons to Hemedti, they can use Haftar and his\nnetwork as the middleman. In fact, this is already happening. Haftar is already working as a middleman to transfer supplies\nand weapons to the RSF on behalf of Russia. Yes, Russia is already here in the form of the private\nmilitary called the Wagner Group. They've been in Sudan for years, supplying training for the\nRSF in exchange for getting in on the lucrative gold trade in Sudan. And while Russia has also\nworked with the Sudanese Army in the past, a recent CNN\ninvestigation shows that Russia is sending significant\nsupport for the RSF implying that they've chosen\naside in this conflict, but there doesn't seem to\nbe any real loyalty here. Russia will likely shift\nto favor any leader who will likely win in this, who will support Russian interests and in facilitating their\ngoal to eventually build a naval base here in the Red Sea. And then you've got the\nneighbor to the North Egypt who has to walk a fine line in how they support this conflict. Egypt more naturally\naligns with the government and the military of Sudan, but they can't publicly\nbe against the RSF. They can't choose a side quite yet. That's because the Egyptian\neconomy is in trouble. Their currency has lost\nover half its value and they've been asking\nfor help from the UAE who has sent them a hundred\nbillion dollars in cash and other aids since 2013. It would be unwise for Egypt\nto be on the opposite side of the UAE on this. Their economy depends on them, so they're maintaining a\nmostly neutral stance for now. Ethiopia and Eritrea are\nboth for now neutral. Though Ethiopia has\ninvited general Al-Burhan to visit in recent months, and Eritrea invited his enemy,\nHemedti, for a visit as well, signaling that they may\nland on opposite sides in the future of this conflict. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia\nand the United States are offering to act as mediators hoping for a peaceful resolution. And some are looking to China who recently negotiated a deal\nwith Saudi Arabia and Iran. China might use this as another moment to flex its new diplomatic muscles and broker of peace in Sudan. This conflict between two\ngenerals is more than it appears. It has the potential to spiral\ninto a full on proxy war both by regional partners\nwho bear the brunt of this conflict, but also foreign powers who care much more about\nsecuring their own interests than the devastating human effects of the conflict they are fueling. And worse, in Sudan, we see a conflict where the main players,\nthese two generals, are both incentivized to\nkeep playing the same game that the once dictator,\nOmar Al-Bashir, designed where a broken system\ndelivers power and riches to a few at the top incentivizing them to keep this system divided and broken just as Al-Bashir designed it. And in the process, killing the momentum of the budding democracy\nmovement in Sudan. This protest movement that successfully took out the dictator, and this movement that\nwas good for the people has once again been snatched\naway by a greedy few, and there seems to be no end in sight.

(upbeat music) - We're out here on the frozen sea ice and we're hunting for a seal.\n(speaking foreign language) (soft music) - In a tiny village in Greenland where the\nsun is just coming back after a winter of darkness and yet the ice around here\nis at its highest point. I'm actually on an island but no boats are getting in\nand outta here anytime soon. I've been moving through\nGreenland, trying to get to villages and settlements\nthat are impossibly far away, villages like this dot\nthe coast of Greenland. Settlements of people\nliving impossibly high up on the globe, living on\nthese rocks that are spilling off of the world's\nlargest and iciest island. (soft music) I set out to go to one of these northerly villages, to try to understand what happens to them when the ice closes in and\ntheir world transforms, turning from liquid to solid, cutting them off from the world but also opening them up to walk on water. So let me introduce you\nto a place that many don't know much about, Greenland, a\nplace built on deep traditions but one that is facing rapid change. (soft music)\n(upbeat music) I am in this village in rural Greenland. The sun just came up after\na very, very dark winter. It is negative 30 degrees,\nand I am trying to make it to a small island up\nthe coast of Greenland. Here comes our airplane. We're taking that little plane but that's just the beginning\nof our adventure here. (upbeat music) Well, that was a stunning flight. Geez, now it's time to\nget on a helicopter. (soft music)\n(upbeat music) Okay, we made it to this\nisland called Uummannaq. It's impossibly far away\nand impossibly beautiful. We still have one more leg to go to get to the island village that\nwe are trying to get to but the map doesn't actually\nlook like this right now. It actually looks much more like this. Everything's frozen. Lucky for us, we can just walk on water. (soft music) Are they seal? - [Mark] Yeah.\n- Seal skin gloves. - [Mark] And this is polar bear. - Oh wow.\n(upbeat music) So now we're just cruising on the sea ice, headed towards the village. During our ride along the sea ice, we stopped to feel the silence\nof this frozen landscape. The local who is towing\nme in his sled told me that I was lucky that this ice\nwas just barely thick enough. If I had come just a week earlier, I wouldn't have been able\nto ride over the ice. - 15 to 20 years ago. We can freeze already from October all the way to end of June, but nowadays, first maybe February. - [Johnny] Okay, shall we continue? - Yes sir. - [Johnny] Let's do it. We continued on our way\nand after an hour or so, in the distance, I could see the village that three days ago I set out to find. (soft music) We pull into the frozen\nharbor of this village of 200 people. Okay, this is Saattut and\nI remind myself where I am. I'm on an island, a settlement perched on one of the scattered\nrocks off Greenland's coast, deep in the Uummannaq Fjord system 450 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. The amount of time and\nenergy it took to get here was my first lesson about life on the ice. But this was just the beginning. The first thing I want to know about this place is how\ndo they get their food? That's what we will figure\nout tomorrow morning. (upbeat music) I gotta do something\nreally important right now sitting out here in the middle\nof like this deserted field. But I need to thank\ntoday's sponsor who made this really ambitious\nresource intensive video. Possible thank you NordVPN for sponsoring today's video and for supporting tons of our videos.

It's nordvpn.com/JohnnyHarris. Thank you NordVPN for\nsponsoring this video this adventure, this wild\ninsight into a different world. I'm very grateful for their support. Let's get back to this\nadventure, there's a lot to see. We are here in Greenland exploring. After my first night in\nthis village called Saattut, I woke up to the dim winter light and could see this place\nclearly, this is an island, a small one, three times\nsmaller than Central Park. (upbeat music) Most of the year it's surrounded by water, reachable by boats from the\noutside that bring supplies. But during the darkest months,\nSaattut gets locked in. It is now cut off from\nshipments from the outside. The ice gives them access\nto new ways of living new ways of hunting, and that's\nwhat I'm gonna see today. We're going hunting with Nikolaj. (speaking foreign language) - A local here who is gonna show us what this looks like. Hello.\n- Hello. (speaking foreign language) We're having a little pre\nhunting breakfast here. Wow, amazing. Thank you. Nikolaj and his daughter\nare about to take us out hunting for the day. He immediately realizes that we're gonna need\na couple extra layers to keep these outsiders warm. (speaking foreign language) (upbeat music) (speaking foreign language)\n(upbeat music) Now equipped with the adequate insulation for the negative 15\ndegree weather, Nikolaj and his daughter, were ready\nto take us out onto the ice. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] So are we going\nto get to the dogs now? - Yes.\n- [Johnny] Oh great. - To the dogs now.\n(upbeat music) (dogs whining) - So all of these are your dad's dogs? - Yeah.\n- Your father's dogs. - Yes. (dogs whining) - There are really\nstrict rules about dogs. You can't bring dogs up here\nof any kind from outside. Only the native sled\ndogs that have been here for generations are allowed to be up here. And that's because these\ndogs are a very specific kind of dog that for generations\nhave been a vital part of the survival of these\ncommunities in the winter. (upbeat music) Putting on the heavy duty stuff here, 'cause we're just out here on the ice all day and it's gets cold. (speaking foreign language) - All right. It's finally time to see\nhow people live out here during the winter.\n(dogs whining) (soft music) Moving over solid water on dog sleds is what Inuits\nhave done for generations. As I rode with Nikolaj, we\ncouldn't communicate much because of our language barrier,\nbut one thing he made clear is that the ice used to be a lot thicker Ah, that's how thick it was before. The ice was much thicker before but right now, right now, this\nice, how thick, like this? (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] Yeah. Yeah.\n(soft music) Today Nikolaj is hunting for seals who are at\ntheir plumpest right now. And thanks to the winter ice, Nikolaj can set up net\ntraps around the edges of giant icebergs where he\nknows the seals will swim. (speaking foreign language) (upbeat music) - It's been a very\nimportant thing to survive during the harsh winter. - [Johnny] Yeah. (speaking foreign language) - [Mark] Ah, there's a seal right there. - [Johnny] I see it. I see the seal. (speaking foreign language) (upbeat music) - [Johnny] So we got a\nseal using an old Inuit trapping method in hunting\ngrounds that are only available for a few months outta the year. The same hunting grounds\nwere not long ago, another seal was caught and\nturned into food and clothes. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] So your pants\nare made out of this. The seal, the same type of seal that came from this type of trap. - Yeah.\n- [John] Wow. Are they warm? - Yeah, so yeah, really warm. - [Johnny] I was surprised to see Nikolaj started burying the seal in snow. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] And this is where\nI realized how much Nikolaj and I thought very differently about ice. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] As we headed\nto another seal trap, I thought a lot about ice. For me, ice is just frozen\nwater that allows me to cool down a drink\nor ski down a mountain. But for Nikolaj and his community, ice is infinitely more important. (upbeat music) What's he doing here? - We're moving small powder\nof snow to make it clear so he can see. - [Johnny] The way that\nhe handled the ice, used it as an anchor, cut it, shaped it, the number of nuanced statements he made about the ice's behavior. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] We get to our next\nseal hole and Nikolaj quickly deduces what's happening\nunder the frozen surface, just from a few hits with his shovel. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] We dig, despite\nthe extra layers of ice that Nikolaj somehow senses. (speaking foreign language)\n- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see it.\n(speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] And eventually we\nmake it through, another seal, maybe a pair of gloves.\n(upbeat music) With a long glance into the distance, Nikolaj then tells us\nthat our time is limited. (speaking foreign language) But with a couple hours\nbefore the blizzard comes, we head to another island\nto look for ptarmigan. (speaking foreign language) An arctic bird that is a delicious\nstaple during the winter. (speaking foreign language)\n(upbeat music) During the hunting, we\ninteracted with a lot of what looks like a\nbunch of ice and snow. But for Nikolaj, his\ndaughter and their community, this scene is actually full\nof dozens of types of ice. Each of them with their own\nbehavior, their own purpose. Sea ice itself is its own category with its own set of words. Thin sea ice is different\nthan thick sea ice. The ice around an iceberg\nthat Nikolaj was studying is also its own category, its own word. There's a distinct word for this ice hole and a verb that means to chip away at the ice that formed\nin this hole overnight. This ice chunk anchoring\nNikolaj's rope has its own word as well. There's a different word for\nflat ice and newly formed ice. Uneven ice and old ice, inland ice, fresh water ice, slushy ice. There's even a word for the deep sound that ice makes when it moves and cracks. The word for cracked ice\nis distinctly different than the word for the\nactual cracks themselves which is also different\nfrom the verb from moving through a narrow passage of\ncracked sea ice in a boat. There's a word for this, the edge where the ice\nends and the water begins. There's even a word for the crusty sharp ice\nthat forms on top of snow. And a word for the water\ncreated when snow melts on top of sea ice and I could go on. (upbeat music) I'm learning a lot about\nthe behavior of ice. Had no idea how complex it was. This rich vocabulary is an indication of how alive this ice is\nfor these communities. It moves and creeks, it comes and goes. It provides the ground to find food and then it takes it away. Learning to speak the language of the ice is a must for\na community like this. I'm struck by how he's\nable to navigate out here. Like these icebergs are not the same ones that were here last season. They're changing every day.\n(speaking foreign language) - Sometimes they tilt and float and move and yet they've memorized this\nspace just for this season. (soft music) We made it to the ptarmigan\nIsland and stopped for lunch. It's a fact of the world that when you're cold and\noutside, everything tastes better. I'm eating tea and a poppy seed roll. It's effectively the\nbest meal I've ever had in my entire life. Before heading up the hill, Nikolaj had to show me his harpoon, the one he uses to catch whales. (speaking foreign language) - This has been used\nfor hundreds of years. - Yeah.\n(speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] We spent no less than two hours climbing this\nisland looking for ptarmigan. (speaking foreign language) - Nikolaj casually turned\nto us and let us know that this was actually\nan Inuit burial ground. This is where his ancestors are. All right, he's going in for the kill. (upbeat music) (gun firing) (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] We had a few close\ncalls with the ptarmigan but in the end, no luck.\n(gun firing) (speaking foreign language) - No luck, we're heading\nback to the village with no birds but two seals. So we headed back to the sled and soon we were gliding\nover the sea again back to the village before\nthe blizzard could fully hit. Nikolaj invited me to his home where I met\nhis wife, Anna Sophia. They fed me their favorite\nfood from the sea. (speaking foreign language) - Yes, I'm now eating narwhal, the majestic arctic whale\nthat I honestly thought was a make believe character\nup until a few years ago. Did you catch this narwhal or did you buy, you bought this narwhal from\nsomeone else in the village. (speaking foreign language) - [Mark] They caught it themself. - You caught this narwhal yourself? (speaking foreign language) - And soon we were over in the TV room, looking at the tusk from\nthe narwhal we were eating. So it was a big, big narwhal. - [Mark] It was big. Yeah. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] So dinner consisted\nmostly of narwhal meat, narwhal ribs.\n- [Mark] How is it? - It's good, yeah. It's very salty. And the delicacy of\nnarwhals skin and blubber which is cubed and eaten raw,\nsometimes with soy sauce. Here we go. Whoa. All of this accompanied with\nfresh water from an iceberg. This is melted iceberg. - [Mark] So it's from the\nInland's ice from Greenland. So you are drinking a glacier. - Oh, lovely.\n(speaking foreign language) - It's really good, and to be clear, I wasn't just saying this to be polite. Raw whale skin is objectively delicious. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] Now, I understand. - Yeah. - [Johnny] I had come here\nthinking that this community had no other choice but to hunt\nduring the cold winter. And while they are more\nlimited to their access to the outside world during\nthese months, this conversation taught me that they don't just\nhunt for survival, they hunt because this food, this\ntradition of being out there on the ice, connected to\nthis volatile weather, it's part of what gives\ntheir lives meaning, it's part of their identity. (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] After finishing\nup with the narwhal and seeing more seal\nclothing, I asked something that had been on my mind\nfor a while, which is, how much longer could this small island and\nall of its traditions survive, especially with the powerful\nforces of modernization luring people to the big cities? Do you think some of the\ntraditional practices of hunting and Inuit culture will\ncontinue, will still be here in 50 years, even with\nall the modernization? (speaking foreign language) - Yeah.\n(speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] Nikolaj and Anna\nSophia have three daughters, and they are the ones that\nwill ultimately answer this question. Their oldest daughter, who's 19 has already made up her mind. So yeah, I'm curious\nwhat your thoughts are about moving away from Saattut. You said you didn't wanna leave. - In my future, I want to be a fisherman like my father. - [Johnny] You do?\n- Yeah. - Ah, wow. And what about your other sisters? Are they, do you think they'll be fishermen too or? - No.\n- No. They don't want to. - Yes, when I ask my little\nsister, she said, \"Hell no.\" - Oh man, so she won't be in Saattut, she'll maybe live in Nuuk or something. - [Daughter] Yes.\n- [Johnny] Yeah. - [Daughter] Like she want to be a nurse. So she want to be. - I left Saattut with much more clarity on what life in a small\nArctic village looks like. How they do it, why they stay and why some are leaving,\nGreenland's capital, Nuuk, is further south,\nit's a less extreme climate and it offers convenience and work. Work that doesn't\ninvolve breaking into ice looking for seals or\nstocking birds up a mountain. One that is not based\nnearly as much on ice that is getting thinner\nand thinner every year. And yet, if I learned\nanything from hunting on the sea ice with\nNikolaj and his daughter, it was that these\nactivities were so much more than just a means for\nsurvival, the ice, the dogs, the traipsing around\na snowy mountain where your ancestors are buried,\nlooking for an arctic bird. This isn't about\nefficiency or convenience, it's about connection, it's\nabout meaning and tradition. It's identity unlike\nanything I can relate to. But it's an identity that\ncontinues to be chipped away at and threatened\nby all of these forces from the outside world. But this tension is not\nnew to Greenlanders. They've been experiencing some version of outside forces\nthreatening their culture for a really long time. For a long time it was the\nDanes, the colonizers here on Greenland who came in\nlooking to exploit this land and to modernize and\nindustrialize this place. And with them they brought disparity, economy, industrialization,\nnew forms of development, income but in exchange, they brought with them an attempt to\neradicate the culture here, forcibly shutting down\nsome of these settlements, pushing the people into\nbigger population centers so that they could work in\nfisheries and factories, sterilizing the culture and even trying to thin the population. Forcibly stripping away any\npopulation from their land and then separating\nthem from their friends and family would take a toll on any people but for a culture so rooted\nin their natural environment, this rapid assimilation effort from the Danes has taken\na particularly harsh toll on Greenlandic people - Very, very fast assimilation that a lot of people lose their identity. That was a mental violence. So many of them just\nchose to become alcoholic, to forget their problems. - As I moved south, I met up with Pauline a therapist who sees the\neffects of this every day. (speaking foreign language) - And those problems from back then continued\nto many generations. Many of them had no opportunity\nto heal their trauma. Even the grandchildren of the people who were forced to move commit suicide and have alcohol problems. - [Johnny] Greenland has\nthe highest suicide rate of any place on earth. Alcoholism is a major problem. (speaking foreign language) (soft music) - [Johnny] And yet there's\nhope in this story. After decades of cultural\ncleansing and forced assimilation, Greenlanders have been fighting back to regain their autonomy,\nto regain their culture. Over the decades, their political\nsystem has broken further and further away from Denmarks to where they now govern themselves. And Greenlandic culture, once on the brink of extinction is coming back. (speaking foreign language) (soft music) - [Johnny] To see what this looks like, I headed south, on a layover\nin one small village, I found a moment to head\ndown to the ice to meet up with a group of ladies who love\ncold water as much as I do. Good morning. (upbeat music)\n(speaking foreign language) - Woo, feels amazing, yeah. (upbeat music) I'm awake.\n(laughing) Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good rest of your day. (upbeat music) I got to Nuuk and met up with Qupanuk, a mining engineer that the world\nknows better as the creator of Q's Greenland, where\nshe shares Greenland with the world in the most amazing way. - [Q] All these buildings here are anew. They weren't there for\nlike three years ago. - The first thing you\nnotice when you get to Nuuk is how many cranes there are. Okay, so this is definitely\nnot the sleepy little town that I was expecting, this\nplace is big and it is growing. Everywhere I looked,\nthere's a freaking crane. As Q drove me around, we caught a glimpse of these massive apartment blocks, physical symbols of\nGreenland's colonial past. - [Q] That they are from the fifties, sixties back then when they\nclosed down small villages and forced people to move to town. - [Johnny] Whoa. - [Q] So they're forced to\nmove into those buildings here. - [Johnny] Whoa.\n- [Q] Yeah, that was the colonization. - [Johnny] Yes. Yes.\n- [Q] Big part of it. Yeah, to this is the future Nuuk, biggest school in Greenland. So it's gonna. - [Johnny] The cranes,\nthe apartment blocks, this town of 20,000 people. with all of this rapid\ndevelopment seemed like a place where Greenlandic culture\ngoes to wither away, to be replaced with supermarkets,\nshopping malls, cars and convenience.\n- So it's crazy how much construction\nthey're doing right now. - [Johnny] This is likely\nwhere Nikolaj's middle daughter will end up, far from home and seemingly far from her\nculture, from the seal pants, the days out on the ice,\nthe dogs, the narwhal, at least that's what I thought. But after spending a day with\nQ, I learned that I was wrong. - I'm hoping to buy the fresh\nseal meat at the market. - [Johnny] Yeah. - So we can have it for dinner tonight. - [Johnny] Okay.\n(upbeat music) - First stop in Nuuk, the butcher. I know what it's like to go\nhunting for seal kind of. So it's pretty cool that even here in the\ncity, they're doing this. (upbeat music) Soon we were on the outskirts of town and I was learning just how\nalive Greenlandic culture was here. - So we could actually\njust hike from my backyard and then go out and then we'll\nbe able to find ptarmigan. - [Johnny] Do people\nstill go out and hunt, even though they could\ngo to the grocery store and it's so much easier. - We do it to get extra special food. - [Johnny] Why do you do it? Go out, do all the effort\nto get special food? - Because it tastes really good. It's different. It's fresh. - [Johnny] Yeah.\n- It's your, like the feeling of self\nproviding is so amazing. It's like a must.\n- [Johnny] Yeah. - We can't live without it. - You can't live without it. Here it was again, that\nsame sentiment that I heard around the dinner table\nin that tiny village. There's truly no need to hunt here. And yet the people here still do. Do you think that with\nall this modernization, there's a feeling or worry\nthat it's gonna dilute or- - I'm not worried about the remote places, like the small places, I'm definitely not worried about them. I can be worried about, like my children wouldn't learn how to go\nhunting, fishing and all that but I make sure that they do. They get to try it and all of that. We are becoming more and\nmore proud of who we are, how important it is to\nkeep our own language and all of that.\n- Yeah. - So I think it's just\nlike tracing it back. - Yeah. Yeah. And are you consciously\ndoing that with your kids? Are you-\n- Yes, yes, yes, yes. - In what ways? - So we only speak Greenlandic to them, so we are making sure that they are fully Greenlandic\nspeaking and we have these great abilities that we should be much more proud about.\n- Absolutely. That Nikolaj was and his daughter, his daughter who's like on Instagram and Facebook and has an Apple watch but then is out there with the sled dogs. And when I came here I\nsort of thought it was one or the other, you\neither choose modernization or you choose Greenlandic culture. - Oh, no, no, no, it's\nboth, the same time. - [Johnny] Yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah. You can have both. - [Johnny] You can have both. - Yeah.\n- [Johnny] Yeah. - So no, Nuuk is not the\nplace where Greenlandic culture goes to wither,\nat least not for now. Greenlanders like Q, live\nmodern, connected lives and yet they retain their\nconnection to the land, the animals, the plants, and\nthe ice that has provided for their ancestors for centuries. - Hello, how's it going? - [Host] Hello. - That night I ended up at Q's\nhouse where I met her family and watched as she made soup from that fresh seal we\nbought earlier that day. Another meal made possible by the sea ice. Oh my goodness. That is so good. - [Host] Is it good?\n- Yes. So good. I like seal.\n(soft music) I came here trying to\nunderstand how people survive in remote villages during the winter but in the process, I learned\nseveral unexpected lessons. Lessons about identity\nand meaning that comes from old practices, lessons\nabout the complicated nature of modernization and the\npoison of forced assimilation. And I left feeling grateful for the people who let\nme into their world. One so different than\nanything I'm familiar with, showing me that some\ntraditions are too strong, too valuable to be wiped\naway by modern conveniences. (soft music)"

    "captions": "This guy over here in Germany, Rudolf Diesel, invented an engine that changed everything. This new engine mixed pressure, and air, and fossil fuels that all exploded and made things move. This changed a lot of industries. But the Germans were like, \u201cLet's put these in submarines and run them to charge a bunch of batteries that we can use to power the sub while we're underwater.\u201d \u201cIt's a lot better than the hand-crank.\u201d And indeed it was. But there was one big problem, which is that this engine needs air, like, it needs to be able to pump out the exhaust that it makes and it needs to be able to suck in air to make energy. So you can't actually run your engines underwater. So these German subs, as stealthy as they were, were still very limited because they could only stay under water for like 48 hours max before having to come up and give away their position so that they could get air for their engines. This is a problem that will soon be solved, but we just need a few wars first."

They tried to use \u201cthe turtle\u201d in their war for freedom against the British, but it never really did anything useful. And then it just sank cool name but wasn't a super useful submarine but it paved the way. 50 years later, we have the American Civil War, where the Confederate rebels built a sub that was powered by a bunch of guys manually turning a crank and on board it had a long spar torpedo. Don\u2019t be fooled, though \u201cspar torpedo\u201d is just a fancy way of saying a bomb on a 15 foot stick. And they actually used it.

    "title": "WTF Happened to Nuclear Energy?",
    "video_id": "QzTgZ6kOEM8",
    "captions": "- [Johnny] For most of human history, our species has been trying to\nsolve the problem of energy. How do we stay warm and cook\nour food, heat our homes, and later how do we power our world and communicate with each other? Then 70 years ago, we found a solution\nthat changed everything, an energy miracle. - [Announcer] A giant of\nlimitless power at man's command. - [Johnny] We found out\nhow to throw a tiny neutron so hard at a special kind of\natom that it would split apart, releasing a huge amount of\nenergy in a chain reaction. First, we mostly use this\nchain reaction as a weapon. - [Announcer] The shadow of the atom bomb has been across all our lives. - [Johnny] But then after the war, we started using it for\nmore peaceful things to solve our age old energy problem. We learned to control the chain reaction, creating heat to boil\nwater and spin a turbine. And we had electricity,\na lot of electricity, all from this tiny amount of fuel. This was the utopian\npromise of nuclear power, clean energy for all. Using the simple power of an atom. - [Announcer] Within the atoms heart is not one but many giants seeking to provide vast quantities of energy to run the world's machines. - [Johnny] And for a while we loved it. The US started building\nnuclear power plants all over the country. Power plants started popping\nup across Japan and Europe. Soon, France will be getting\nnearly three quarters of their power from nuclear energy. All this in a time of oil crisis when fossil fuels are\nexpensive and getting scarce, the power of the atom was bringing peace and\nprosperity, abundance. But then, nuclear turned\nfrom darling to outcast. - [Announcer] There has\nbeen a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union, a state of emergency, two of the country's nuclear reactors. - In the worst nuclear\nreactor accident to date. - [Johnny] Today, nuclear\npower is in decline and I've been trying to understand why. Why in an era of climate\ncrisis caused by fossil fuels are we winding down this effective carbon-free energy source? What happened to the\npromise of nuclear energy? Inevitably, I ended up in a conversation with my friend Cleo, who makes a show called The Huge If True. She's someone who's reported\non this a bunch before and was the perfect person to talk to to help me sort this out. Why is nuclear energy\nnot like the saving grace of our civilization? We like sort of gave up\nand I don't understand why and I want to understand why. - This is a great story. Yes, I've looked into this in\nsome ways for various videos, but I've never gone straight at it. I've never done the like\nwhat the heck happened with nuclear video? - I feel like I will have a\nclearer version of this story if we can do it sort of tag team. - Are we gonna do the\ncynic optimist thing? - I maybe, yes, here's the plan. I'm going to go down the rabbit hole on why people are afraid\nof nuclear energy. Like what is the actual deal here? What are the events and the\nthings that freak us all out? - And I'm gonna figure out, okay, so what do we do about that? - [Johnny] Yes. - How do we use nuclear in the future? - And we can compare nodes to\nlook at like is there a future for this technology and should\nwe actually be as afraid as we are? - Awesome. - Alright.\n- Let's do it. - Okay, focus. Oh, alright. Boy, I know so much more\nabout nuclear energy than I did a few weeks ago and I'm very excited to share it with you. And Cleo is actually on her way right now, like she's about to show up to the studio and we're gonna do a little\nshow and tell Explainer and it's gonna be very exciting.

It's very affordable and it\nreally can change your world. So thank you Grammarly for\nsponsoring today's video. I think Cleo's gonna be here very soon. I can't wait to show you what we learned about nuclear energy. Let's go. - Oh my God, you made it.\n- Good morning, hi. - Welcome to our studio. - Hi.\n- Hi. I suppose it's normal\nbackground radiation, the time find any will maintain. - Just some radioactive waste. - [Presenter] But what\nexactly is nuclear energy? I don't know, but I know someone who does. - Okay, let's do this. We went deep in this on very\ndifferent sort of aspects of nuclear energy, but we agreed upon three major\nbuckets that are the reasons we believe that nuclear\nhas not sort of become the promise of the future. Let's call them nuclear's\nthree big problems. And they are accidents, waste and cost. You understand these three and you really understand\nnuclear's big issue or nuclear's big solutions. I wanna start with accidents\n'cause accidents really are, I think the biggest, most powerful thing in\nour popular imagination of why nuclear is scary. - Totally. - When when you think\nof nuclear power plants, at least for me I thought\nof like Chernobyl. Chernobyl is this really scary event that happened in Ukraine in the late '80s when a\nnuclear reactor melted down and then exploded and spewed\nradioactive material invisibly into the sky. Hundreds of thousands of\npeople had to evacuate and it turned the entire area into this like toxic wastelands. And it just has this very sort of scary apocalyptic energy to it. I mean it's the reason\nwhy it's like the subject of this really popular HBO show. Chernobyl led to the death\nof hundreds of people. I think a lot of people think it's like on tens of thousands of\npeople it was really hundreds of people. - From radiation.\n- Radiation, exactly. And then a lot of people were\ndisplaced, they had to leave. And that causes a huge disruption\nand is a major human cost. The numbers aren't massive here\ncompared to other disasters that occur, but it's the spectacle of it. Like you see this and you\nsee what radiation does. Radiation is this really\nweird invisible thing that like you can't see,\nbut like suddenly it, if you're exposed to it in high doses, it can start to like break\ndown the very building blocks of of your cells and just sort\nof deteriorate your body like from the inside. Like it's really sort of gruesome and hard to think about and look at. And I think that leaves\nan impression on people. This isn't the only\nevent that has happened. Here in the United States, we had a nuclear accident\nat Three Mile Island, 147,000 people had to\ntemporarily evacuate. It led to no deaths. - I think that's surprising\nfor a lot of people. - I think it is too. I again, because the spectacle. More recently there\nwas a nuclear disaster, the third sort of big one in Japan after an earthquake\noff the coast of Japan. It created this like massive tsunami that washed up onto Fukushima and there was a nuclear plant there that got completely\noverrun and broken down and had another meltdown. Okay, but it's not just accidents. Think about having this invisible scary\nthing called radiation. And if you are someone\nwho wants to do harm and you get your hands on this stuff, you can turn it into a weapon. - And you're not even talking about controlling nuclear\nproliferation by focusing on where people get uranium\nand enrichment and all of that. You're focusing on once\nnuclear power plants are built, there's a security risk. - Absolutely and you see\nthis in like polls and stuff. You have this public opinion\npoll here in the United States that asks Americans if they think we should\nuse nuclear at all. Not like should it be\nthe number one source or should we invest in it? It's should we even use\nit as one of our sources? And look, almost 50% of people don't think we should even have it at all. Like we should do away with nuclear power. - It's perfectly split. - Yeah, it's a 50:50. The percentage of people who\nsay that nuclear power is safe is going down every year. And is at 47%. - What happened in 2011? - That's Fukushima and it did in me too. Like I feel this, I feel this association with nuclear power because of these events. This is Japan and nuclear is in yellow right after Fukushima. You see that nuclear power in Japan just gets kind of squashed. - Yeah. - So I think for me, the reason why accidents is\nlike the top of this list is because accidents have\nthis big psychological effect on people. - I think we need to separate\nout though risk of accidents which are terrifying from\nsafety of an energy source because those are actually\ntwo different things. What we really wanna know isn't\nhow many accidents happen. It's deaths per unit of\nelectricity production. - So like every electricity\nsource is risky in its own way. And you can measure how\nmany people die based on how much energy you make. - Yes, this is the data for solar, nuclear, wind and hydropower. - [Johnny] Okay. - [Cleo] So what you can see is that they don't have that many deaths per unit of electricity production. What this is saying is that these are all really,\nreally safe energy sources and nuclear is between solar and wind. Like this is really important. - Oh wait, I didn't even see\nthat nuclear was down there. - [Cleo] Yeah. This includes all deaths\nfrom accidents and nuclear is between our two most exciting\nrenewable energy sources in terms of safety. All of these are- - And yet when we think of\nnuclear, we think of danger. - Yes, if you think about our energy mix, how much power we get from\ndifferent sources of energy. - Holy shit. - [Cleo] That is fossil fuels. Here's the data that really\ndrove this home for me. So our Weldon data, that's the source of the chart that I just showed did\ncalculation to really show people how this affects actual humans. So what they did is they set\nup a town called Euroville. This is a town, hypothetical\ntown of 150,000 people. - Nice. - And Euroville uses one terawatt hour of electricity per year. If you powered Euroville\nfor one year with just coal, this is the number of\ncitizens of Euroville that would die if you chose oil. If you powered Euroville\nfor one year with just oil, this many people would die. Coal is actually 25, oil is 18. - Okay. - This is just one year of powering a town of 150,000 people. Those are real humans with\nfamilies and lives and jobs. If you chose gas, three people, if you chose hydropower, one person, if you chose wind, nuclear or solar, it would take 25 years\nfor one person to die. - [Johnny] Wow, 25 years. - [Cleo] I think it is\ntotally understandable to focus on how scary accidents are. I don't mean to say like, look at this data like\nwe're so irrational. - [Johnny] Yeah. - But I do think that if we\nreally cared about human lives, we would be paying a lot more attention to how many people fossil fuels kill. And we would be trying really, really hard to replace fossil fuels\nwith wind, nuclear, solar or hydropower as fast as humanly possible. And this is before we\nget to climate change. - Mm, uh huh, yeah. Yeah. - This is just production\nof these energy sources. - Yeah, it's not the carbon ramifications. - That's another reason,\nbut it's separate from this. - I think it's that the accidents\nare just inherently scary in the same way that like\na plane crash is scary. It's a spectacle. - Yeah. - Coal and oil is like car\ncrashes, it happens way more. - Yeah. - But we don't really pay attention, just genuinely surprised. I would've guessed nuclear was higher up. I really would have. - After the question of actual\ndeaths from nuclear power and other energy sources, there's also this question\nof a fear of radiation. You see it in the headlines\nall the time about living next to a nuclear plant. - Yeah. - Or working in a nuclear\nplant or whatever. - Yep. - And again, the thing here is about our\nhuman brains assessing risk. So these are a bunch\nof sources of radiation and this is a spectrum that's\ngonna help us compare them. - Hmm. - So what do you get from a\ntypical chest CT scan compared to taking a flight from New York to Tokyo? - Yeah, give me one clue at least. - So this one is can\ncause radiation sickness. - Radiation sickness is if\nyou're up at a thousand. - Yeah. - Okay, that's scary. - Guess where the other things go? - Okay, I'm gonna start\nwith flight versus x-ray. - Yes. - Like chest x-ray. Like I get a chests X-ray, I go on a flight from New York to Tokyo. I'm assuming that a flight isn't crazy. So like maybe one and then the chest x-ray\nis probably like 10. Man, I'm probably so off. - Let's keep going, keep going. - All right, so I'm gonna\ngo here, I'm gonna go here. Did I do 'em all? - So what I'm seeing from your guesses are you are aware that we get radiation from all kinds of stuff. - [Johnny] Yep. - From flying from chest\ncts, from chest x-rays, all of that. But you have an impression\nthat if you live next to a nuclear power plant or if you work in a nuclear power plant, you're like signing up for more radiation. - Yeah and it's probably not like crazy. You're not gonna get cancer, but like you're getting a\nlittle bit more radiation than if you're just like\nliving way far away. - Right, okay. Here are the real answers. So a couple things make total sense. The annual amount received by a worker in a nuclear power plant is\nlower than the maximum annual dose by way we get that. But a typical dose from\nliving within a few kilometers of an operating nuclear\npower plant for one year is less than a typical chest x-ray. - [Johnny] Whoa. - [Cleo] And way less than\na typical chest CT scan and less than a flight\nfrom New York to Tokyo. - [Johnny] Wow, living\nnext to it for a year. You're living next to\nit for an entire year and in one like 10 hour flight you are getting more radiation exposure. - [Cleo] A lot more and also\nthis one is super important. This is the average total dose from natural background radiation. This is what all of us\nare getting no matter what from living on earth in our\nparticular solar system. That is significantly\nmore than living next to a nuclear power plant, working within a nuclear power plant. The major lesson from all of this is most of the radiation exposure that you'll get in your life\nwill be from plane trips and x-rays and natural\nbackground radiation. Even if you lived right next\nto a nuclear power plant, even if you worked in\na nuclear power plant. - Hmm, wow, okay. Radiation is probably\nanother one of these sort of invisible scary things\nthat we maybe over-index on our hesitation about\nbecause we don't understand it. And that's how I feel. Radiation, to me, is invisible. It is scary, what it does to us is scary. And so I sort of associate\nlike proximity to things that create radiation I.e\nnuclear power plant as like, oh well that's the source of it. If I'm close to it I'm probably getting it 'cause I can't really see it. - Again, like none of what\nI'm saying is meant to imply that accidents aren't\ndisastrous and terrifying or that radiation in doses\nthat are on the upper end of the spectrum is also\ndisastrous and terrifying. I just made a video about cancer, it scared the heck outta me. - Yeah. - But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't also\nput it into context. We should put all of\nthat data into context in comparing deaths to\ndeaths from fossil fuels, in comparing radiation to ways\nthat we receive radiation. - Absolutely.\n- Other ways. - Yep. - This is just about putting\nthat risk in context. - Into perspective, okay, okay, wow. That definitely like\ncomplicates the nuclear is scary because of accidents kind of narrative that I think is very much alive in the popular like perception\nof this energy source. - Yeah. - The thing that keeps going to mind is that the fossil fuel number like that, that is just still very\nmuch in my mind right now. - It's wild. - Okay, can we move on? - Yes. - Okay, wow, accidents. These other two are I think less huge, but still important. One thing that we hear\na lot about is waste. I saw a tweet recently from\nGreen Peach that was like, nuclear energy isn't like\nviable for the future. The waste problem is still a thing. And that sort of sent me\ndown this rabbit hole. The first thing I think\nof is like Homer Simpson and like green goop, like\nnuclear waste that like, like never it's like in a barrel somewhere and it can like sneak\nout and destroy everyone. - My eyes, the goggles do nothing. - I know that is a\ncaricatured version of it, but there is a reality\nthat when we do fission, when we break apart atoms to make energy, there is a byproduct of that. In fact, I have a chart here. Actually most of nuclear waste is not like some like scary material, but the thing that scares people\nis actually this little 3%. It's the vast minority of what nuclear waste\ncomes out of this process. And it is the spent fuel. This is scary because this\nis stuff that comes out and gets put into like big barrels, okay? And it gets stored on site. Like at the nuclear power plant. Every year we make relatively,\nnot a ton of this stuff, it's about the size of half\nof an Olympic swimming pool. Okay, so it's not like a ton\nrelative to how much energy we get out of it, but like the thing that's scary is that this stuff doesn't go away. There's this really clunky\nchart that you don't really need to look at all the lines on. What you need to look at\nis that X-axis down here. You look down here and you just see really,\nreally big numbers. This is how long this\nwaste stays radioactive. And yes, you're looking at a number that says 1 million over here, human beings have existed in this form for like 200,000 years and we're talking about\ncreating a dangerous material that lives on potentially for hundreds of thousands of years, if not a million years before\nit becomes benign again. That is a problem. And this isn't just like in one facility like this isn't like all\ncentralized in one place. Like if you look at this map of the US, this is where all of these sites are, like there are a lot of 'em. So there's a lot of points\nof failure as time goes on, you can see how this could just build up and become like a massive management task. - I have this very instinctive\nfear of this stuff. - Yeah. - I think one of the things that helps us to look at what it is in my imagination, nuclear waste is green goop, nuclear waste is actually a solid pellet. - Hmm. - So we are trying to\ndispose of a solid material that is extremely radioactive. At most nuclear power\nplants, we have these, they're called dry casks. So basically those fuel\npellets that look like this go into a column inside a metal rod that's just about half an inch across. - [Johnny] Okay. - [Cleo] And then all\nof those rods together are bundled into a fuel assembly. - [Johnny] Okay. - [Cleo] Then those are put inside of, one of those big casks. - [Johnny] Yep, yep. - [Cleo] That you showed. And then they're covered in concrete. There's an outer shell, there's\na sealed inner cylinder. These things are built\nto withstand tornadoes and direct attacks and floods and every possible natural\ndisaster that you can imagine. And they're certified for about 40 years. Obviously that is nothing in the timescale of radio activity. People look at the difference\nbetween that timescale, they're like, oh my god,\nhundreds of thousands of years. That doesn't mean that there are lots of uncertified unsafe dry casks all around the country. Like in the research that I was doing, I didn't find a single\ninstance of a radiation leak from a dry cask or a single instance of an attack on a dry cast\ndeliberately meant to do harm. - Yeah. - That doesn't mean that there\ncouldn't possibly be leaks and it doesn't mean that there\ncouldn't possibly be attacks. - Yeah. - But just in this, in terms of what we're\nreally talking about here and risk assessment. - I think for me it's, I'm like, cool, it's only this big now, but what's gonna happen\nnext in the long run? - Other countries are doing what's called deep geological storage. - [Johnny] Oh, whoa. - So what you in theory wanna do is assemble those fuel pellets into those fuel rods,\ninto those canisters. And these are, the canisters\nare slightly different, but then you bury them\ndeep, deep, deep undergrad. There are some countries that have already built systems\nlike this, Finland is one. There are lots of countries\nthat are investigating them. This is technology that is\ntotally difficult and impressive that we can do, but it's\nbeing tried, it's being done. This is feasible. And in fact, if you go back to the\nchart that you were using, you might have heard of Yucca Mountain, which was the United States' effort to do deep geological repository. Yucca Mountain failed for\nlots and lots of reasons, some local politics. But again, this is a\nprimarily political problem, not a technological one. - Hmm. Yeah, I think that like I\ndefinitely feel this sense, and I think this is probably\na pretty popular reaction to this, which is like we\nhave this like hot potato and we like need to get rid of it. So we put it in these casks\nthat are only good for 40 years and then it's like, hmm,\nthat's gonna run out. So let's just like bury in a giant hole and like make it go away. But it's still gonna be there. I think I kind of share the reticence of having an energy source that just continually\nproduces this as a byproduct. Even if we do have these technologies, can you find a way to have it\nnot have a byproduct, please? - Actually not quite. But so think about this waste, the reason why the waste\nthat we just talked about is scary is that it's radioactive, which means that there's\nenergy in this solid. - Yep, yep, yep. - That's also a really exciting prospect because there are ways\nthat we can use that energy and not only does that\ngive us an energy source, it also allows us to shorten the radioactive lifespan of nuclear waste. - Of the waste. - Down from potentially thousands of years to if you do this enough\nhundreds of years. - So you can use nuclear\nwaste as fuel for more energy. - You can recycle nuclear waste. - You can recycle nuclear waste. - Yes. - I dived all the way into this in a video that I'm now gonna promise\nis gonna be on my channel by the time we air this one. - So it's live right now on your channel? - Yes. - You better be because\nI just told people. - I'm promising that it is right now. - Go to Cleo's channel\nand watch her deep dive on nuclear recycling that I need to watch. - Yes, so here's the visual\nto just keep in mind, this is the way that the United\nStates does this right now. - Okay, they mine it,\nthat goes into uranium, they put it into a reactor and\nthen it creates scary waste and then they have to\nput it somewhere, okay? - [Cleo] Exactly, it's a straight line. We don't reuse our nuclear waste. - [Johnny] Okay. - [Cleo] But there are systems\nthat are closed fuel cycles, so we have an open fuel\ncycle, it's one line. - [Johnny] Yep, yep. - [Cleo] But there are closed fuel cycles where various different kinds of reactors can actually recycle nuclear waste so that you're getting more energy out of the nuclear fuel itself and also cutting down on\nthe wreck radioactivity. - Oh my God, that seems\nlike a game changer. - And just for all the\npeople out there right now who are saying that\nseems totally infeasible, Japan already does it. - [Johnny] Whoa. - [Cleo] This is a much too\ncomplicated visualization of Japan's nuclear fuel cycle, but they've been recycling\nnuclear fuel for years. - Wow, yeah, this is a huge game. If this could actually happen at scale, like if this could actually be applied, then you really cut down\non one of what I see and actually feel is like\na major stumbling block for this energy source,\nthat is a game changer. - Huge if true. - Huge if true. Nice.\n- Sorry. - That was perfect. Okay, so we've done\naccidents, we've done waste. Both of those are really\nassociated with fear. - Yeah. - Of bad things happening\nin the long run especially. And the third one is like not bad, like the third one is just\nthe plain old numbers. It's just cost. And this is actually like perhaps\nlike the most cut and dry, which is that nuclear costs\nmore than everything else. And it's gone up over time. Like meanwhile you've got this\nyellow line which is solar and it's just like, (air whooshing) - That's an amazing. - There's been so much investment. There's been so much innovation in this, dipped down, look at that. - It's beautiful. - That's like we've gotten\nso good at making solar cheap and it's obviously been\ninvested in by the government, but like nuclear is expensive\nand that's a problem. - Is this worth it? Is the conversation that\nwe should all be having. - Yeah. - And not from a place of fear, but from a place of\nevaluating what the best bang for our buck is to stop using fossil fuels and use clean energy sources. - Yeah. - And if that's not nuclear and if we have better solutions\nin renewables, awesome. - Yeah. - Like that's great. - Totally. - But it has to be based\non what's best for us. - Yeah. - Not based on calling out\none specific energy source and creating an environment\nof fear around it. - Yeah. - Without context. - Absolutely. - The question like you mentioned is always how much do we actually invest in creating these energy sources, in causing this innovation and\ncausing this price decline? This church has government subsidies for various kinds of energy. You've got fossil fuels in blue, you've got renewable energy and yellow, you've got nuclear energy,\nvery small in green. And you can see obviously that we're investing\nmore and more renewables, which is awesome. The question that we have\nto ask about this chart is how does it compare\nto the amount of energy that we get from each of these sources? - [Johnny] Totally, totally. - [Cleo] Because if\nthis perfectly lines up, then it's just dollar\nfor dollar investing too. - [Johnny] Yeah, yeah. - [Cleo] The answer is when you compare how much we're investing\nin each kind of energy versus the amount of energy that that source actually\ngives us right now, what you see is that\nnuclear is a little bit less than renewables these days in\nterms of our full energy mix, but it's getting invested in way less. - Yeah, which why is that? Is it because of the fear? Like it's probably because\nof these like big concerns that we've talked about. - I think we're now in a situation where we're operating a lot\nof old nuclear power plants that are no longer competitive with the new sources of energy\nthat we've been investing in. And those new sources\nof energy are amazing. Like, that's great. But we did strangle a\npotential clean energy source in a lot of ways. - Yeah. - And so I'm not totally sure\nto be honest whether the fact that nuclear isn't competitive is because of a loss of\ninnovation and investment that could have happened years ago or because it was never\ngonna be renewables. And kind of at this\npoint it doesn't matter. - Yeah, yeah. - Like we are where we are. - Yeah. - I think that at the\nvery least I would hope that we're evaluating this based\non the technology's ability to help us as opposed to based on a lot of fear mongering over decades. - Yeah. - And I think what I've\nfound is that the fear and the concerns are\nreally kind of sticky. You can't make an HBO miniseries\nabout like an accident in a solar farm. I think after talking to you about this, I feel like there's a\nlot more to the story that if invested in, if looked into, has a lot of potential\nand that potential maybe hasn't been able to be fully realized. I don't know if this\nwins out in the long run, but I think it needs a fair\nshot than it's been given. - I think that's my takeaway too. - Cool. For me, I'm gonna watch this\nreally closely in coming years to see if like this turns around and like we actually do check our fears and realize that there\nis promise in this energy and we really kind of\ndon't have another choice. We have to figure it out. - And because we're so wrapped up in our fears about nuclear power, we didn't even talk about\ninnovation in nuclear energy. New kinds of nuclear reactors. - Yeah. - New kinds of fuels that we might use. There's an enormous part\nof this conversation that's like we can talk about\nnuclear as it exists today, we can also talk about the future. - Mm. - And that's something that\nI'm really excited to do. I think you can only do that frankly after you begin to unpack this part. And so what I loved about this is like it felt like you\nwere bringing the concerns that very reasonable people\nhave about nuclear energy, but then we were able to talk\nabout the context around each of those because the ultimate question when we talk about energy sources is always compared to what? - Yeah. - Deaths from nuclear\naccidents, in my opinion, should always be compared to deaths from other energy sources. - Yeah. - Radiation should always\nbe compared to radiation from other sources. Investment in X should always be compared to investment in Y. And so I think when we are\ntalking about how we get energy in the future, I think this conversation\nhas to be compared to what, what kind of future do we wanna have and how do we get there? - Yeah. - Hi Homer, what gives? - Mr. Burns is making me eat\nall these drums of toxic waste. - Geez, that's rough. There must be 200, 300 gallons in here. - Yeah and even a teaspoon\ncould cause a fatal tumor. - Hey, you wanna come\nbowling with us tonight? - Okay. - Okay, that's it. That's the video. That is a video that Cleo\nand I have been working on for a very long time talking\nabout for potentially years. And now we've finally done it. And yes, we used overhead\nprojectors and transparencies, which is surprisingly useful. Like I understand why\nthis was like the story of my elementary school life. Very useful visual display mechanism. So another video is over and I need to quickly show\nyou something, one sec. Check out my map poster. I mean you can't really\nsee it super well here, so let's just like cut\nto it, there we go, okay. This is a poster that I've\nbeen thinking about for years and it's finally real. It is a printed thing. It's called All Maps Are Wrong and it shows all of the map\nprojections, not all of them, a bunch of them that we use\nto take a spherical earth and put it on a flat plane. And I love it and it's beautiful and I got a lot of help designing\nit from some good friends and some people on our team and it's just a very, very\nspecial product for me. So that is on sale. If you want this poster to\nlive on your wall, you can, it lives on my wall and will\nbe next to my desk forevermore so that I can look at map\nprojections all day long. That's a major way that you\ncan support this channel. By the way. More and more we rely on our community to support our independent journalism. We have a growing team\nand it takes resources and time to build these videos. And so your support is\nvery, very appreciated. We also have a community\nover at The Newsroom, which is our Patreon. This is a place where you can\ncome and support every month and you get something in return behind the scenes of log that we do. Some people show up to\nPatreon just to support us and they don't want anything in return. But if you do, this is a fun thing to see\nhow our operation works, how we make what we make the people and the processes behind these videos. You'll also get access\nto my scripts and music and a bunch of things that\ncould be useful to you. We have lots and presets that help color our video and photo. Also, many of you don't know\nthat I started a company a few years ago, it's called Bright Trip. It's a place where we make courses about how to travel smarter brighttrip.com. And I think that's basically it. Thank you all for being here,\nfor watching today's video. We've got a lot coming up and I will see you in the next one.

A lost continent that was supposed to be right next to the North Pole. This is the early 1900s. It's a time when the world map has been thoroughly\nexplored and documented. There were just a few places\nthat were still kind of blank and this was one of them, the high north, an icy ocean that was incredibly\ndifficult to get through, but people thought there was\nthis north polar continent unexplored for now but people\nwanted to get in on it. They wanted to see what was up here. And in fact, a couple explorers roaming around this area had\nreported seeing land up here. It created this frenzy, this wonder. Was there a lost polar continent\nup near the North Pole? I want to show you the story\nof how this all went down. It's the story of the\nexplorers who decided to go into the most impossible terrain on earth just to explore it. And it led to a passionate rivalry between these two dudes with big egos. It's full of fake photos\nand smear campaigns and it was kind of like\nthe space race of the day. A race to see who could be the first to get to the top of the world. (dramatic music) Okay, so let's get up to speed on what we're talking about here. The Arctic is kind of\nanything above this line, but we should ditch this map. This is the Mercator projection, which I kind of have thoughts on. Where the Mercator fails is\nits representation of size. It massively distorts everything\nin the north and south and it's just not gonna\nbe good for this story. So we need a better\nmap. Check out this map. This one's way better. Watch. This beautiful map I have\nhad for a very long time and I'm finally going to be\nable to use it for a story. Look at that beauty! (dramatic music) Man, this is just such a\nbeautiful map, just gorgeous. This is what we're going\nto use to tell the story. This is the top of the world. But anyway, before we go on, I need to say thank you to today's sponsor who made today's video possible. Thank you, BetterHelp for\nsponsoring today's video. I've said it before and I'm\ngonna continue to say it. I'm a massive fan of therapy. I believe that therapy has\nbeen stigmatized over the years and we're going through an era where it's finally being normalized. I've been in therapy for a few years now. It's changed my life. And one thing I know is that finding a\ntherapist is really hard. Like it's a often very clunky process of, like, calling doctor's offices and checking insurance and all this stuff. BetterHelp is a platform that solves this. With BetterHelp you just take a quiz and then it pairs you up with a therapist in their giant network of,\nlike, tens of thousands of licensed therapists\nthat aren't confined to your geographic location. And you can communicate how you want, either through text message or\na phone call or a video chat. You get to choose how you\ncommunicate with your therapist. If your therapist isn't a good\nfit, you can change for free, which if you've ever done\ntraditional therapy before, that's much more difficult of a process. You can message your therapist at any time and schedule live sessions\nwhen it is convenient for you. All of this allows therapy\nto be more accessible, more affordable, and\nthere's even financial aid for those who need it. So there's a link in my description. It is betterhelp.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel. It also gets you 10% off your\nfirst month of BetterHelp. So you can try it out at a discount and hopefully see if\nit's good fit for you. Thank you, BetterHelp for\nsponsoring this video. Let's dive into this insane\nstory about the North Pole. Okay, the North Pole,\nthe top of the world. Reminder that this is\njust one giant ocean, but the reason it looks like\nthis is because it's frozen. You can't just, like, sail through it. And yet many explorers\nhad this lofty goal. They wanted to reach the North Pole, the arbitrary place on our planet that's just a bunch of\nice sheets sliding around where all the longitude\nlines come together. The place that we just decided with math was the top of the earth. You know the North Pole where Santa lives, that's what we're talking about. That is what the explorers\nwanted to, like, get to. So why attempt to reach\nan arbitrary bit of ocean that's super impractical and risky? Because it's there, dummy. We're humans. We don't\nask questions like that. We just have to go. (dramatic music) People had been trying to\nget up here for centuries, trying to figure out what they would find. Maybe if they got through the ice, there would be some warm water ocean here. Maybe there'd be new shipping routes over the top of the globe. By 1845, explorers were\nmaking custom ships. They were reinforcing\nthe hulls of war ships with thicker wood that\ncould take on the pressure of the ice and they would go and explore and they didn't find any\nuseful shipping routes. But they did find people. These people, the Inuit,\nknew a thing or two about how to handle the cold. They knew how to build\nshelters out in the ice. They made kayaks and parkas. They used dog sledges to get around. Oh, and these dog sledges are pretty cool. (dramatic music) But let's not get distracted. That's for a totally different story that I'm doing on Greenland. The point is that these\nAmerican and European explorers realized that any North Pole expedition with a chance of success would\nneed to rely on Inuit guides. So it's the late 1870s and we start to see the\nfirst serious attempts to finally reach the North Pole. Every attempt being its\nown version of crazy. Let me show you some of these. All of these little lines\nare different explorers and their attempt to get here, to the center, to the North Pole, and each one was insane. Like this guy who intentionally\nfloated from Russia, got his boat stuck in the ice on purpose and then let the ice, which\nis always moving around, sort of drift him around\nand carry him with the hopes that it would, like, carry\nhim to the North Pole. But instead he just did these\nlike sort of loopy loops and eventually got, like,\nspit out next to Svalbard. I mean these guys were climbing,\nlike, 30 foot ice ridges. They were facing off with polar bears whose territory this is. I mean, these guys are out exploring in some of the harshest conditions ever in the name of adventure. Exploration? Like that is why they were doing this. They became heroes for kids back home. But anyway, this is all just backstory. Our story that I really want\nto tell you about starts now and it has to do with\nthis guy Robert Peary. Arctic explorer who is obsessed with getting to the North Pole. I mean just look at\nRobert Peary's portrait. Peary was an American Navy\nengineer who was dead set on becoming famous, once writing a letter to his mother saying quote, \"Remember, Mother,\nI must have fame.\" Like, that's who this guy is. He and his obsession with being famous is a huge part of this story. So Peary is out exploring the Arctic. He makes Greenland his hopping off point, that's sort of his home base. And on his second expedition,\nhe breaks his leg. Luckily in his expedition\nhe's got this Greeny doctor who comes and helps mend his leg. And while his leg was healing, they stayed up in the Arctic\nfor, like, six months. And during that time, this Greeny Dr. Frederick Cook learns a bunch of skills\nfor surviving in the Arctic. He even starts picking\nup the Inuit language. Okay, so eventually Peary's leg heals and they head back down south and Peary is like pretty impressed with the Greeny doctor who's now learned all these new skills. He's like, wow, Cook, you're incredible. We'd love to have you on our next mission here in the Arctic. But Cook wasn't into it. He didn't want to be\nsome footnote in history. He was feeling confident\nafter his one expedition and he decided to strike out\non his own as an explorer. Peary was kinda like, okay, cool Cook, like have fun trying to be an explorer. You're like super ungrateful\nfor everything I've taught you, like, good luck. And thus the seeds of tension were planted between these two. Old school Peary versus\nnewbie, starry-eyed Cook, both with big egos and both\nwilling to do what it takes to show that they were great explorers. So they go their separate ways. The newbie doctor turned\naspiring explorer, Frederick Cook sets out\non his own expedition back to the Arctic, feeling super confident. Wait, no, this trip doesn't\nget any adventure music. It was a total failure, like they barely made it to here and then they had to like turn back and abandon their ship and like, ah, Cook. And Peary is, like, loving this. While Cook was getting\nowned in the Arctic, Peary continues to kill it as this engineer turned Arctic explorer who pines to be famous. He's busy going to Greenland and bringing back three giant meteorites. Who goes out on an expedition and comes back with\nmeteorites, like, from space? Peary. You're the real deal. He writes a book about his adventures and starts to get heralded as the greatest Arctic\nadventurer of their day. I mean, look at this face, this guy's kind of a badass. True story. I was in Greenland a few weeks ago and I tried to take a\nphoto just like this. It didn't really work out.\nOkay, so back to Cook. He doesn't give up. He's slowly getting better at this whole explore the Arctic thing. He goes south to Antarctica\nand goes on another expedition that goes horribly wrong,\nbut this time Cook is ready. He meets the challenge\nand he makes it out alive, leveling up immensely in the process. By 1898, Peary moves to Greenland,\nlike, kind of permanently and makes his focus on\ngetting to the North Pole. Like, that is his dream. He is training, he's recruiting people and he\nstarts to go out on attempts. He wants to be the first\nperson to the top of the world. And this is where we kind of start to see Peary's true colors. Like, as much of a badass as this guy is, you do a little bit of\nresearch and you realize that he's actually kind of an (beep) and like there's so\nmuch to say about this, but little sampler here, he brings back six Inuit to New York. Four of them end up dying and there's this whole insane story that you can read about in the citations. But, yeah, he's not a great guy. He cheats on his wife with a 14-year old and has a kid with her. And then there's this guy,\nhis number two, Matt Henson. Henson was like one of the\nbest non Inuit dog sled drivers in the world. He even learned to speak\nthe Inuit language, something that Peary\nwasn't even able to do. But Peary described him\nas quote, \"His assistant,\" because he's black and goes on to give\nhim basically no credit for all of his achievements. So yeah, Peary's kind of an (beep) but that doesn't mean that he wasn't also an incredibly skilled,\ndetermined explorer. I mean he stays up here for four years, refining his technique\nto get to the North Pole. He obsesses over gear and\ndesigns custom sledges and even creates this\nperfect water boiler. And he keeps going back,\nmaking attempt after attempt and each time some disaster occurs and they have to turn back. In the process, he loses eight toes to\nfrostbite, but he keeps going. He gets closer and closer\nand finally decides that it is his time. So he builds this custom ship, he mounts a massive\nexpedition and he goes out. And on what he hopes\nis his last expedition, he claims to have passed\nby a piece of land sticking out of the ice. This would later go on to fuel the idea that there's a continent up here. All these newspaper articles\nI was showing you about, like, is there a continent near the North Pole? But anyway, on this expedition,\nhe still doesn't make it. The furthest he was able to get was here, just 200 miles from the North\nPole, but he had to turn back. So wait, is that it? Is Peary giving up? He lost eight toes to frostbite and he didn't make it to the North Pole? Wait, just pause on Peary for a second. We'll talk about what happens next, but first we gotta get\nback to this guy Cook. What's Cook up to? Well it turns out the Cook\ncontinued to level up, getting more and more experience, getting more and more famous. He goes to Alaska trying to\nbe the first to summit Denali, which is the highest\npeak in North America. And he comes off the mountain saying that he made it to the top. Whoa, Cook! We're no longer playing\nin the minor leagues. He's a legit explorer now. He's even elected as the president of the Explorers Club in New York. By 1906, he's kind of like\na BFD in the explorer scene and soon he's sitting in the bougie National\nGeographic Society dinner in Washington DC, a dinner that was put on to actually honor Peary for\nall of his Arctic explorations. Okay, so this is where it gets juicy and like the tension and drama\nreally starts to, like, rise because during this dinner\nAlexander Graham Bell, the guy who invented the\ntelephone, no big deal, he gets up and is like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Peary's cool and all I know we're like celebrating\nhim here in this dinner. But what about Cook? Let's hear from Cook. A man who's gone to the top\nand the bottom of the earth and the largest peak in America. So Cook gets up and toots\nhis own horn at this dinner that was supposed to be for Peary. Peary must have been\npissed at this moment. Like, this was his moment to shine. He was getting all this\nattention and who's there? Cook, the guy who was like a Greeny doctor who's now his rival, but who Peary considers as a\nhack, like not a real explorer. But now Cook is feeling good.\nHe's no longer a newbie. So he sets his sight on beating\nPeary to the North Pole. The race is now on. (dramatic music) So it's 1907 and Cook heads to the Arctic. He gathers a crew to go to the North Pole. There's one other westerner,\nhe's got nine Inuits and a dog sledge team for each. Peary was pissed at Cook at this moment for even attempting to be the\nfirst one to the North Pole. And to make things worse, Cook was using a bunch\nof Peary's techniques and recruiting Inuit that Peary\nhad built relationships with and doing this all just as\nPeary was about to head off on a final attempt of his own. So months go by, six months\nand then eight months and now it's been a year and no one has heard from Cook. Is he dead? Who cares, says Peary. He's getting ready for his\nown expedition to the north. Teddy Roosevelt wishing\nhim well on his way. And just like that Peary\nand his crew are off, racing to the North Pole. Cook? Still out there somewhere. And the world wondering\nwho will get there first. Newspapers start wondering\ndoes he still live? It is a seesaw of doubt and hope. Who may have the story\nof finding the North Pole or who may be buried\nsomewhere in the snow and ice. And headlines back then were so cool. (dramatic music) And then on September 1st, 1909, on this little island in the north, a ragged Dr. Cook appears ashore. He heads straight to the telegraph station and sends this message. (dramatic music) This is huge news. Cook says he reached the North Pole and that he found land up here in what a lot of people thought\nwas just a frozen ocean. Okay, but wait, it's not over. Literally five days later who shows up on the Labrador\ncoast, but freaking Peary! What? Five days later he sends his own telegram. (dramatic suspenseful music) And if the press wasn't\nalready stoked enough about Cook having come\nback and discovered land and got to the North Pole first,\nnow they're going berserk. This is so juicy, the great rivalry, climaxing in this big fight. They can't, where you can't,\nlike, make this stuff up. So they turn to Peary and they're like, \"Oh, Cook arrived five days ago and said that he was the first one to get to the North Pole before you did.\" What? He did not just get bested by the cocky newbie that he trained. \"No, Cook is lying,\" Peary says. The rivalry between these two\nguys is hitting a crescendo and the newspapers, their cartoonists and their readers are all loving it. It leads to this waterfall of\nmemes depicting the rivalry, which at this point was about\nego, fame, money, reputation, all playing out in the epic\nArctic, the last frontier. I mean this should be\nlike a miniseries on Hulu. Like I would watch the hell out of this. - [Announcer] The true story\nof two very different men in pursuit of the same goal. - My favorite cartoon is this one. It's a \"Puck\" cover showing the North Pole holding a bag of money, with Cook holding a note\nsaying, \"I saw you first\" and Peary holding a\nnote saying, \"So did I.\" (laughs) Oh, it's so good. Oh. Oh, and Cook was super\ninto like gum drops apparently. Anyway, so now it's like full\nblown information warfare between these two. Peary's going out on\nthis, like, smear campaign to undermine Cook's credibility\nsaying that he's been lying about all of his accomplishments. \"He didn't actually summit\nDenali,\" says Peary. So then Cook fires back\nrevealing kind of his snarky side reminding the world that\nPeary is this 52-year-old man with just two toes. Oh, and it's awfully suspicious that he didn't take anyone with him who could corroborate the\nlatitude that he was at. Among all these memes\nand selling of newspapers and the public bickering, the question still remained\nwho actually got there first? Well, shouldn't that be easy? Why don't we just go to the North Pole? We can obviously go there now and see what flag is planted there. No, because remember the North\nPole is just a frozen ocean and the ice drifts like miles per day. So that won't work. The only way to actually\nprove who got there first is to review the evidence\nfrom these expeditions, the journals and the\nrecords that these guys kept and then compare that\nagainst solid evidence. And to be honest, both these\nguys' accounts are full of weaknesses and weird stuff. Like remember when Peary insisted that there was a land mass up here? Well, a later expedition went out and had this like horrendous experience of trying to look for that land and they discovered that it was not there, that this was totally made up. Many think that Peary made this\nup in an earlier expedition to rally excitement to raise\nmoney for future trips. So what did that mean? Who\nactually got there first? Was everyone just lying about everything? Has the North Pole ever been discovered? Well, it would actually be decades of exploration, observation, and analysis before some clear conclusions\nstarted to emerge. For this story we read through\nbooks written by scholars who have dedicated much of\ntheir professional lives to answering this question. And here's what we can\nfinally say with some clarity. Peary probably made it to\nthe North Pole on this trip. Academics have debated this\nand most say that he came between making it like\nwithin a hundred miles to actually making it dead\ncenter to the North Pole, just depending on who you ask. And while we're at it, it's\nalso possible that Henson, remember Henson, the number\ntwo who didn't get any credit because Peary is probably racist, was actually the first to get\nthere because he was the guy who forged the path for Peary to follow. Meaning it was very possible\nthat the first person to step foot on the North\nPole was a black man. Kind of cool. Okay, but what about Cook? Didn't he start his journey\nlike almost a year before Peary? Did he actually get there first? No, Cook did not get there first. Years of research has\nrevealed that Cook was a liar, like a full-blown liar. The furthest that he probably\nmade it was like here, 400 miles off of the North Pole. AKA, he never actually traversed the really difficult\nportion in all of this. He made it far enough to be\nable to tell a convincing story and then he headed back and\nsent this telegram saying that he made it there first. Whoa, Cook. Okay. But at least he's like\na legit explorer, right? Like he summited Denali\nfirst. I mean he had pics. Wait, no, turns out these pics\nare not the top of Denali. They're actually shots from\nlike 15,000 feet further down. AKA, not even the elevation\nof Denver, Colorado. Like this was a total staged photo that he lied to the world about to say that he was the\nfirst one to make it to the tallest peak in North America. Cook was a liar. He had tricked the world and\nmany believed him. Wow, okay. So Peary was a (beep) set on being famous, but at least he was a legit explorer who probably made it to the\nNorth Pole or close to it first. And Cook, seemingly a decent explorer, was actually just a\nmuch better storyteller and a full-blown liar. (sad deflated music) But this is kind of unsatisfying because we don't actually\nknow definitively who was the first person\nto, like, touch their foot on the North Pole, which is like, why do we even need to know that? Why is that important? Because it is. No one gets the credit\nwithout needing to go into all of these caveats and there's way more caveats\nthan I've gone into here. Instead, this is a story\nof reputation manipulation and media blitzes, of\ncontroversy and debate, optics and lying. And instead of seeing a Neil Armstrong, we're left with more of like\na couple of Elon Musk types, but I won't leave you there. Let's just say definitively who made it to the North\nPole first with no asterisks. In 1926, Roald Amundsen, the man who had previously won\nthe race to the South Pole, became the first to get to\nthe North Pole undisputed by flying over it. So he didn't actually touch the ice, he just flew over it. But it wasn't until 1948 that a Russian was the\nfirst verified person to walk on the pole, like actually like put your\nboot on the North Pole. He took a plane to get there and then just like\nwalked on the North Pole. In 1958- - [Announcer] The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear\npowered submarine. - Went under the pole,\nwhich was another first, and submarines are really awesome and we made a whole video about\nthem that you should watch. Then finally, the first undisputed person to reach the North Pole by land was a guy from Minnesota. It was essentially the\nculmination of like a bar bet that got way out of hand. That's a whole other story. But yeah, it was 1968\nand with a snowmobile. So it really gives you an appreciation of what Peary was capable\nof doing decades earlier using Inuit wisdom, his\nown clever inventions and a lot of sled dogs. (bright music) So today the question of who\ngot to the North Pole first is not really a question that most people are thinking about a lot when it comes to the Arctic. I went to Greenland a few weeks ago and have been reporting\non the changing Arctic, exploring how different\ncountries are vying for ownership and influence in this space because this frozen ocean\nwon't be frozen for long and now it's opening up\nto new shipping routes, new resources unlocked as the ice melts. But one thing that hasn't changed is how the media treats a story like this. A race, a rivalry of public\ngossip fest with big egos, hungry for attention and\nespecially when there's imagery to go along with it. I think we're all eager\nto believe what we see when it fulfills some deep need to witness the excitement of exploration. And today, the people who still want to be in the spotlight do so\nby bickering and boasting about how great they are. And the media still\ngleefully covers it all. Covering the lies,\ncovering the deceptions, as long as there's a great story and a great image to go along with it. And sometimes that's fact\nchecked and the truth comes out and sometimes we just never know. (dramatic music) Wasn't this a nuts story? Like, isn't it just wild,\nthese two characters and how it's like not that much different from people on Twitter today? Anyway, this was another deep dive where we had so much stuff and\nif you look at the info doc, which is like our kind\nof research doc for this, it's literally hundreds of pages long. So anyway, thanks for watching. I hope this was a fun one for you. And, yes, this map is\npermanently just up in my studio because I want to look at\nit every day of my life. Speaking of maps, let\nme show you something. I made a poster about maps and I'm very, very excited about it. It is called All Maps are Wrong, and it is a display of a\nbunch of map projections, basically the mathematical\nalgorithms that we use to take a spherical thing called the Earth and put it onto a flat thing\ncalled a piece of paper. This map kind of celebrates that. It has a little explainer in the middle that explains why we need to do this. And then it has a name of\nall of the map projections that are displayed on this poster. This is beautiful and cool and fun and I've been wanting to design something like this for years, but it's also a way that\nyou can help support what we're doing here. We're trying to make rigorous\njournalism on YouTube, not as a part of like\na big corporate entity, but just like us. And to do that we more and\nmore rely on our community to help us do it better and to be able to pour\nourselves into these stories. And we kind of have a big team\nthat helps us do this now, like our team is growing. In fact, speaking of our team, we publish an extra video every month that introduces you to\nthe behind the scenes of what we do here. It is an intro to our team, to all of the people and the\nprocesses and the shenanigans of running this studio. That is available to people who\nare members of The Newsroom, which is just what we call our Patreon. The Newsroom is a place that supports us, but also gets you this\nextra video every month. It gets you access to scripts, you get royalty free\nmusic that you can use, and it's just a fun community. I like post things there like, like I ask for help on\nthumbnails and titles. I get feedback every once in a while. Do a Q&A with the community. So that is patreon.com/johnnyharris. We have lots and presets that we use to color\nour videos and photos. We're publishing more\ncourses over at Bright Trip, which is the travel startup\nthat we started a few years ago and is growing. I think that's it. So thank you all for being here. Thanks for watching this video. We've got a lot more coming and I'll see you in the next one. Bye. What? - [Director] And go get your poster. - And go get your poster.\nAnd go get your poster. Should I reference Greenland? I should. I'd be like, I just was up here. Like, I can't not be\nlike by the way, like. - [Director] No, it's not relevant. - Really. - [Director] You can say\nthat at the end of a video. We have all this footage. Can I not be, like, keep me\nhonest with Peary. (slurping)"

And one thing about Jong\nIl is that he loved movies. He used the art and craft of cinema, not only as a tool to indulge\nhis own creative dreams, but also as a way to drill\nhis propaganda into the minds of millions of North Koreans to hold onto power, cementing him and his family as the powerful\nleaders of North Korea.

Let's get back to Kim Jong Il and all of his wild shenanigans. (singer singing in foreign language) (film whirring)\n(pensive music) - We watched as many North Korean films as we could get our hands\non to make this video. And let me tell you, this is a world of cinema unlike\nanything you've ever seen. It's one full of farmer\nrevolutions and extreme nationalism and women frequently\nsacrificing their lives, as well as a lot of music, spontaneous odes to the great leader and some really colorful operas. (singer singing in foreign language) - So I wanna let you into this world and show you how this happened, how this one man's obsession drove him to literally kidnap people\nin the name of making movies, movies that he used to\nbrainwash his people, but also movies that he hoped\nwould help fulfill his dream of turning North Korea into a\ncenter of world-class cinema. (film whirring) (gentle music)\n(tape clattering) (tape inserting)\n(tape beeping) (tranquil music) Up near the misty volcano of Mount Paektu in a modest log cabin enshrouded in dense snow-capped forest, the great leader opened his\neyes for the very first time. The thunderous rain stilled,\nthe dark clouds parted and through them, a glimmering\ndouble rainbow emerged, arching its way across\nthe muted morning sky and a bright new star appeared overhead making its debut in the open heavens. The shining star of Paektu had arrived. Well, at least that's the story that most North Koreans were told. In reality, the year was actually 1941, likely at some Soviet\nmilitary base in Russia. There probably weren't any\nrainbows or new stars created. It's probably just a normal day. Oh, and his given name\nwasn't even Kim Jong Il. It was Yurei Ilsenovitch Kim, right? That's like a total Russian name. As an adult, he rewrote his\nbackstory again and again over the course of like 20 years. And this is our first big\nclue about Kim Jong Il, the second leader of North Korea. He was a storyteller. (film whirring) (actor singing in foreign language) - The legend goes that when\nhe was seven years old, he was watching this North Korean film called \"My Home Village.\" He's with his parents. And after the movie, this\nseven-year-old Jong Il marched up to one of the filmmakers and\ntold him that the winter scene in the movie didn't feel lifelike because the falling snow\nwasn't actually collecting on the character's head,\nlike it didn't look natural. And instead it looked\nlike what it actually was, which was cotton balls, totally\nlow budget and unacceptable. The filmmakers were so ashamed\nthat they reshot the scene without the falling snow\nand re-released the film. Jong Il's obsession with\nmovies grew over time till he eventually collected\n20,000 bootlegged VHS and DVDs that were stored in\nan air conditioned library manned with 250 full-time employees. Like, this guy was\nserious about his movies and he would watch these\nmovies, like all the time, everything from Hollywood\nWesterns to classics, like \"Friday the 13th\" and \"Rambo\" to Japanese monster\nmovies like \"Godzilla.\" He was a big fan of American\nstars like Elizabeth Taylor, and he apparently loved Daffy Duck and the James Bond franchise. Well, that is until a Bond film came out where North Korean leaders\nwere like the enemies. He was actually pretty\ninsulted with that one. But this guy was a full-blown cinephile. Like, he watched so many movies\nthat his dad, Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea, was actually pretty\nconcerned that his obsession had become unhealthy. But soon, Kim Jong Il's dictator dad would find a way to\nuse his son's obsession to stay in power. (pensive music) Okay, so this story's kind of nuts. It's 1967, North Korea's still\nkind of a newish country, like couple decades old. Kim Jong Il's dad is\nstill the leader, dictator who's running the country,\nhas all the power, but he's got competition\nfrom other powerful people within the party that\nwant him to step aside and make way for a new leader. These men want to steer North\nKorea in a new direction by choosing their own successor to him. And this competing faction\nstarts to use film as a tool to get the people of North Korea on board. They make a movie celebrating the life of this aspiring successor, trying to lay a groundwork\nfor a new cult of personality around this guy, not Kim Il-sung. Big mistake. Kim Il-sung is\nnot gonna let this happen. He goes straight to his\nfilm studio in the capital, Pyongyang, and he gives a speech. He warns the whole film department\nthat someone in the party is trying to glorify themselves, which is super not communist. And they're using film to do it. \"So,\" Kim says to all of his filmmakers, \"we need to step up our game in securing power through film.\" And then he asks, \"If anyone has the courage to guide the film studio correctly,\" meaning to make more effective propaganda that will keep Kim Il-sung\nand his family in power. Oh, and look who's in the room. Film buff and son of the\ndictator, Kim Jong Il, the shining star. He's watching quietly\nin the back of the room and then he speaks up saying that he would nobly volunteer to be the head of the film studio, to help level up North Korean cinema, to help hold onto power. Something must have clicked\nfor Kim Il-sung at that moment. His son, who was not a promising candidate for his successor, he was helplessly obsessed with movies. But here he is stepping up, finally passionate about politics\nbecause politics and film are now kind of the same thing. It was clear that if\nthere was any position that he would fit into, this was it. So he promotes his son on the\nspot to lead the Propaganda and Agitation Department, the department in charge of all\nmovies, plays and publishing within North Korea, retelling\nthis story of North Korea to its people, reframing\nit as something glorious, keeping the people indoctrinated\nto the version of reality that keeps the Kims in power\nand using film to do it. The struggle for the future of North Korea was happening on the silver screen. And now Jong Il had his hand on the dial, in control of what he called this powerful ideological weapon. (tape clattering) (film whirring) (film beeping)\n(nationalistic music) (film whirring) Getting into the mind of\nan artist can be hard, but in this case, not really. (playful music) If there's one thing\nKim Jong Il liked to do, it was to talk about\nhis thoughts on cinema. He wrote an entire book about it, which was kind of the\nimpetus of this entire video, this book, \"On the Art of\nCinema\" by Kim Jong Il. When I was hanging out at the\nNorth Korean border last year, I had this book with me\nand I would like read it in between stops. And it's actually kind of good, or at least parts of it, like\na lot of it's like garbage. But like there are parts that\nactually like I was like, oh yeah, you got this. Like this is basically the holy Bible of North Korean filmmaking and it dictates how movies in\nthe country should be made. (playful music)\n(pages turning) I mean, the book spends a lot of time making it crystal clear that filmmakers are an extension of the\ngovernment and they are charged with the noble task of leading the ideological revolution\nvia storytelling, devoting their artistic\nskill to the party's endeavor to build socialism and communism. In other words, a filmmaker's job is to\nmake clever propaganda for its people. This isn't unique to North Korea. Since the invention of the motion picture, governments of all kinds\nhave used the power of cinema to tell their\nstory in their way, often sugar coated, often\ninaccurate to the facts. But I'm telling you, North Korean cinema has\nits own weird wild flavor. (nationalistic music)\n(film whirring) This is the great age of Juche. (pensive music) Juche is the foundational\nideology of North Korea. It has its foundation\nin Marxist communism, like from the Soviet Union, but it has an obsessive focus on isolation and self-reliance, and it glorifies\nindependence from outsiders. In this book, Kim Jong Il makes it very clear that to make a successful\nNorth Korean film, that characters should quote,\n\"Live, work and struggle with the conviction that they are masters of the revolution and the work\nof socialist construction.\" A lot of clunky language here. I'm not sure if it's\njust a bad translation or if Kim Jong Il is just\na really (beep) writer. Anyway, it goes on to\nsay that the characters in these films should accept\nthe full responsibility of solving their own problems without any outside help. (pages turning) You can see this obsession\nwith self-reliance in this movie called \"Myself\nin the Distant Future.\" There's a scene where this\ntractor is like plowing a field and it breaks down, but it's not a problem for\nthese good communist farmers. Look what happens next. They step up, they pull out their sickles and they harvest the\nrest of the field by hand with smiles on their faces. They don't need outsider\ntechnology from the big city to make their lives easier. They're self-reliant. Oh, and right before this scene, all of these farmers had just broken out into spontaneous poetry, chanting about dedicating\ntheir lives to North Korea. During this like poetic chanting, there's just like shots of Mount Paektu, really nice B-roll, not because it has anything\nto do with the story, but just so we remember\nthat like Mount Paektu is like super important 'cause that's where Kim Jong Il was born. But he really wasn't born there. (people laughing) (screen whooshing) Another big theme is struggle. In the book, he quotes his\nbeloved father Kim Il Sung, quote, \"The life of a revolutionary begins with struggle and ends with struggle. This is really good propaganda\nbecause you've got Juche and struggle as like the\nfoundational ingredients. You start to see stories\nthat glorify and give meaning to North Korean suffering. Like this 1989 film called\n\"The Broad Bellflower.\" It's sort of a love story\nwhere like this woman's lover like gets exiled from the\ntown and there's this tension on whether or not she\nshould leave her hometown for a different life. And then the father of the main character comments very wisely that it's actually better\nto stay and struggle to find happiness, like\nglorifying the struggle. And in case it didn't come\nthrough the first time, near the end of the movie, the main character finds\nout that her lover is trying to come back to the\nhometown that he deserted. And she's confirmed on\nhow right her father was. Struggle is the only way\nto achieve happiness. (person speaking in foreign language) So now all over North Korea, you have starving people cut\noff from the world economy because of their despotic leader, watching these movies, stories about how it's actually\nthe most noble way to live, the key to happiness, the noble ideals of self-reliance. The regime made sure that\neveryone saw these films way out in countryside, in\nfactories, farms, army units, and all of this helped\nNorth Korean citizens reframe their country's\nreckless dictatorship into a protector of an eternal revolution that must continue to\nfight against outside evil. (pensive music) There's a whole chapter in this book that Kim Jong Il writes to screenwriters. He tells them to think of\ntheir stories as seeds. And again, this is actually\nlike pretty profound if not applied to propaganda. He tells these screenwriters\nthat they need to quote, \"Equip themselves with the\nideology of the party.\" Translation, choose\nstories that will stick in people's minds, that will grow, that will turn these\npeople's suffering into fuel for North Korean nationalism and pride, pride in the country that's\ncausing the suffering in the first place. There's one movie where\nthis football player trains ridiculously hard all in the name of quote, \"Achieving the teachings of the fatherly leader, Kim Il Sung, to turn North Korea into\na kingdom of sports. (actor speaking in foreign language) - He ends up training\nridiculously, like way harder, and everyone's like, \"Dude, you're crazy. You're like training too hard.\" And he's like, \"No, I have to do this to glorify my country.\" (actor speaking in foreign country) - These nationalistic pump-up\nmovies pair nicely with films that rewrite the story of\nNorth Korea, the history, the story of Japanese occupation\nof the Korean Peninsula, which was indeed brutal and\ndeserves to be told accurately 'cause it was bad enough. But these movies just\nlike so overly caricature, glorifying the revolution\nagainst capitalists and landlords or showing these caricature\nbattle scenes where the Koreans defeat the Japanese in a good\nold flying martial arts scene. And while these ideologies\nand these messages are kind of baked into the story, oftentimes they're just\nsort of shoehorned in in the form of like a music\nbreak where these characters just sort of randomly burst into songs about how their struggle is good for the future of their country. (singer singing in foreign language) These unwarranted music\nmoments are everywhere in North Korean films. In this chapter, he says that these films must have music that has revolutionary passion, that moves people to strive to defend what is new and noble. (singer singing in foreign language) He says that songs\nshould be short, simple, easy to understand, and to\nsing, infectious, catchy so that people will sing along and get it stuck in their head. (singers singing in foreign language) Okay, so in watching all of these movies, we were surprised that these films give a surprisingly significant role to women. (pensive music) (actress speaking in foreign language) - So this is actually a feature of a lot of communist propaganda, which sees traditional\nfemale roles as in line with the ideals of like a\nmodel communist comrade, submissive, identities being determined by their relationship to the family, to their communities, in this case, and most importantly, to the state. Community-minded submission. Stalin actually used the\nsame trick back in the '30s, creating art that appealed to quote, \"The feminine\nidentification and submission.\" So you see this in North\nKorean films like in this film, \"Girls from My Hometown,\" where the main character\nis this country girl who shows her dedication to her country by pledging to take care of her husband, who's newly blinded after\ncoming back from a war as an act of sacrifice for her country. (actress speaking in foreign language) - In this film called \"The\nName Given by the Era,\" the main character gives\nup going to college to lead a construction and take on the grueling\ntask of building a dam. (actress speaking in foreign language) Why? Because hard work and\nstruggle benefit the country, and that is the most important thing in all of these stories. But by female sacrifice, we can literally mean like\nsacrificing their lives. Like in this film where\nthis woman risks her life in the midst of like the\nstorm mudslide chaos scene all in the name of saving these sheep that were sent to her\ncommunity by the government, (actress speaking in foreign language) (person screaming) - Or in this film,\n\"Song of Retrospection,\" where the main character uses grenades to blow herself up so that she can destroy the\noncoming South Korean enemies to save the rest of her squad. (actress speaking in foreign language) - Using all these principles, Kim Jong Il ran the film studio. He created dozens of films\nthat were his best shot at telling good stories, but really, mostly propaganda for his family's political agenda to keep control over his people. And it worked. Kim Jong Il's dad stayed in power. The people stayed\nsubservient and indoctrinated to this fantasy of eternal revolution and the glorification of struggle. And Jong Il got to make movies. But despite all of this success, there was still one major problem. (singers singing in foreign language) The films still kind of sucked. And Jong Il, the guy with a\ncollection of 20,000 movies that he watched all the time,\nkind of knew that they sucked. I mean, of course, they sucked. His filmmakers weren't allowed\nto watch foreign movies. Oh, not to mention that\nthey weren't even allowed to leave the country. So yeah, these films were kind\nof just in an echo chamber of predictable characters,\nlackluster cinematography, and the same plots over and\nover with a bunch of shoehorned, like poetry and operas like music breaks. They weren't good, and Jong Il knew it. His solution? Steal people from the outside who could make his films better. (pensive music)\n(disk clattering) (machine whirring) (machine whirring)\n(pensive music) So it's the 1970s and Choi Eun-hee is one of South Korea's\nmost popular actresses. She had been married to\nthis South Korean director, Shin Sang-ok, and they\nhad recently divorced. But up north, Kim Jong Il is looking at these two as the potential solution to his problem. So he has his men go to Hong\nKong and pose as businessmen, apparently interested in\nstarting a production company with Choi. They lure her to Hong Kong for a meeting, and this is how she got grabbed\noff a beach at Repulse Bay. She gets sedated, thrown into the boat and they\ntake her back to North Korea where they put her in a\ngovernment building in Pyongyang. A few weeks later, her\nex-husband, the director Shin, goes to Hong Kong to look for her. He's in his car and suddenly,\nthe car in front of him stops, blocking the road and forcing him to stop. A few men, get out of the car, come back and open Shin's door and put a nylon bag over his head. They tie a rope around his ankles and they take him into their car. He too is now on his way to North Korea. Kim Jong Il greets Shin\nwhen he arrives to Pyongyang and he explains what he's up to. He wants him and his actress ex-wife to make him propaganda\nmovies, but Shin refuses. So Jong Il sends him to a\nlabor camp for five years. Okay, so fast forward to 1983. Kim Jong Il decides that the\ntwo are finally enlightened, whatever that means. And he throws them a party\nand tells them that yes, they're still prisoners, but they can make\nwhatever movie they want. He even apparently like\napologized and shifted the blame of like the whole labor camp thing to like other officials and said that he was too busy to notice how poorly they were being treated. Like this guy sounds literally insane. They don't really have much choice here. So they get to work. And over the course of\ntheir years in captivity, they made six movies for their captor. One of the films that Shin\ndirected became a classic. And this is the film I'm like\nmost excited to show you. This is \"Pulgasari.\" (creature grunting)\n(dramatic music) This film seems to be a rip off of a 1962 South Korean\nfilm called \"Bulgasari,\" which was largely inspired by\nthe Japanese hit \"Godzilla.\" We all know \"Godzilla.\" We'll never actually know because the \"Bulgasari\" South Korean film was apparently lost soon\nafter it was released. Anyway, the point is Kim Jong\nIl wanted a monster movie. He wanted this to be so good\nthat he even broke his rule of not letting outsiders come\nin to work on his movies. So in addition to the stolen director that he had already kidnapped, he started recruiting\nthe people who worked on \"The Return of Godzilla\"\na year earlier over in Japan, including the actual guy who\nwas in the Godzilla suit, as well as the man who\nled the special effects, like he had like the dream team. Oh, and of course, to\nget them there, he lied. According to the guy who played Godzilla, he and his crew were told that\nthey were heading to China for a shoot and instead found\nthemselves in North Korea. Okay, so now Jong Il's\nlifelong movie fantasies are in reach. Maybe, just maybe North Korea could make like a\ninternational blockbuster. He's got his kidnapped director\nand all these technicians to make his monster movie great. (pensive music) (film whirring) Yeah, no, this didn't work out. Kim Jong Il was still\noverseeing the whole thing. So the film still was like\nfull-blown propaganda, employing all of the North\nKorean cinematic tricks that Jong Il laid out in his book. So of course, you've got the requisite Juche self-reliance scene, showing the villagers\ngetting water from a well and farming, gotta show that. Got the overarching\nplot that outside help, AKA Pulgasari, does more harm than good. More on that in a second. And then there's the\nrequisite female sacrifice when this blacksmith's\ndaughter hides inside of a bell so that Pulgasari, who eats metal, will eat the bell and simultaneously eat her. And if she dies, then Pulgasari dies too because they like formed\nthis like blood bond in the beginning of the movie. It's a whole thing. (playful music) Anyway, Pulgasari himself is\nsaid to be a manifestation of capitalism in society. The farmers love him at first because he helps overthrow the king, all in the name of promising these people\nindividual freedom. But then they find that they've\ncreated a monster who needs to feed on steel and iron to\ngrow more and more powerful, and it gets out of control. So the farmers just keep\nfeeding him and feeding him with all their farming tools, but then they have no way\nto sustain themselves. So the only thing they can do is stop the beast from growing, which means killing\nhim, meaning revolution. But, and this is where\nit gets really juicy, there's another way to interpret the film. Remember who's directing it, this kidnapped South Korean director. Some speculate that the\ndirector used the film to create an analogy for\nthe tragedy of North Korea, where Kim Il Sung, who at first was helping liberate\nhis people from oppression and occupation turned power hungry, ended up starving the people,\ndemanding their resources, using the revolution to feed only himself. Shin, the director, later said that the film was an anti-war,\nanti-authoritarian theme. So take it however you like. I mean, this film's wild. But in Kim Jong Il's eyes, this was a massive success. And Kim Jong Il was feeling good and he let up a bit on Shin and Choi, allowing them to travel to\nVienna for a film festival where they could maybe\nmeet a financing partner who could bankroll a new project, a North Korean film on Genghis Khan. But of course, when they got to Vienna, they found their way to the US Embassy and got asylum in the United States. Of course, Kim Jong Il was enraged when he found out about this. He actually went back\nand took Shin's name off of all the films that he had directed and ordered a nationwide\nmandate to discredit him. He called Shin a traitor, and his name has become unmentionable without punishment in North Korea. (pensive music)\n(film whirring) So yeah, that is the bonkers\nstory of North Korean cinema. In 1994, Jong Il's dad died and he eventually rose\nas the new supreme leader of North Korea. His love for movies continued\nto influence the form of North Korean propaganda, and they even started an international film\nfestival in Pyongyang. And the only people on the invite list were like all the countries\nthat North Korea vibed with, like Iran, Egypt, India,\nVietnam, and China. Oh, but this wasn't just\nduring the Cold War. The festival was still going up until the pandemic a few years ago. It's one of the few North Korean functions that actively seeks connection\nto the outside world. Kim Jong Il died in 2011, but his legacy in North Korean\ncinema remains super strong. One of the most recent films\nthat we know about came out in 2016, and it's the\nsame old ingredients, female sacrifice, extreme nationalism, unwarranted praise for the\ncurrent leader, Kim Jong Un, and of course, no shortage\nof spontaneous song breaks. (singer singing in foreign language) Hey everyone, hope you enjoyed this video. I know it was kind of long\nand in depth, but boy, we could not stop ourselves. There was too much here\nand there's so much more that we couldn't include. One of my favorite kind of video lately is where we go super\ndeep into like some niche that I would never think to go deep into, but you start to pull on a thread and you just can't get enough. And that's what happened in this case. So I hope you enjoyed it. Let me show you something. Hold on. I made a poster. Look, I've\nnever made a poster before. I finally made a poster. It's one I've been wanting\nto make for a very long time. It's called All Maps Are\nWrong because they are. All maps are wrong in a sense. We're trying to, you know, take this spherical Earth and put it on a flat piece of paper. And to do that, we have to stretch it\nin all these weird ways. And this map kind of celebrates\nthat and reminds us of it and turns it into kind of\nart but it's like smart art. Yeah, smart art, we'll call it. The fact is, this is a way that you can support our channel if you're interested in that, and also get this wonderful poster. You can see the link in the description for where to go find this poster. The Newsroom is our Patreon community where we publish an extra\nvideo every month too. You also get access to\na bunch of other perks that you can check out over\nat patreon.com/JohnnyHarris.

I started a travel\ncompany a few years ago, it's called Bright Trip, and it is a place where\nyou go to get smarter about traveling and to\ntravel in a smarter way. And that's basically it for me of all the things I have going on that I wanted to tell you about. Thanks for being here and\nfor supporting the work that we do just by being\nhere and commenting and being a part of this discussion, I really value this community and excited to keep making stuff.

    "video_id": "kTKogX9O7dY",
    "captions": "(inspirational music)\n(waves crashing) - This continent has some of the most dramatic\nlandscapes on the planet. From the ocean shorelines to the alpine mountains\nand the sandy deserts, and also in this land\nmass from coast to coast, and everywhere in between\nthere lived hundreds, if not thousands of different nations, tribes of people whose land\nthis was, this was their home. But then others showed\nup to these shorelines in their boats, and that\nis when everything changed. (pensive music)\n(text clicking) (button clicking)\n(lively music) Okay.\n(hands rubbing) In the spring of 1803,\ntwo American politicians visiting Paris closed the\nsweetest real estate deal they had ever seen. With the simple stroke of a pen, their country doubled in size,\nall for just $15 million. But in this deal, which was\ncalled the Louisiana Purchase, the US didn't actually\nbuy this land from France. France didn't actually own the land. What the United States was\nbuying was the imperial rights to this huge swath of North America. This basically meant that\nFrance would stay out of the way and let the buddy new empire, the United States, colonize\nit without interfering. If the United States really\nwanted ownership over this land, they would need to get it from the people who were here first, which at the time was lots\nof different native tribes. These are the people who had been here for thousands of years, way before Europeans had the idea of leaving their continent. And this land that the US\njust bought was theirs. (dramatic music) Oh, and this isn't just\nme, like some modern, enlightened person looking back and judging the United\nStates at this time. The US knew that this wasn't their land and that they were going to have to buy it from the people living there. And their big plan was\nto do things differently, not like the old imperial powers that they had just broken away from. In fact, George Washington\nwas quote, \"Determined that the US government's administration of Indian affairs shall\nbe directed entirely by the great principles\nof justice and humanity.\" Go, USA. Let's do this in the right way. So instead of conquest,\nthey would negotiate and sign formal treaties\nwith these native nations. Then they would pay them for\ntheir land, fair and square. (camera snapping) After all, this was a country\nwhose founding document highlights justice, tranquility,\nwelfare, and liberty. In our series, \"How the US Stole,\" we get to see how the US grew from a group of English\nsettlers to a global superpower. But none of those stories\nwould exist without this one, the origin story, the first\nthing that the US ever stole. (film whirring)\n(dramatic music) So Europeans are pouring into\nthis newly formed country, the United States, and the\ngovernment is making deals and signing treaties with the tribes, allowing these newcomer immigrants\nto settle on their land. At first, this is a fairly\npeaceful transactional process. The US would offer food,\nfarming equipment, cash, the services of a blacksmith, all exchange for ownership over this land. But unsurprisingly, a lot of\nthese tribes had no interest in moving out of their ancestral lands in exchange for like farming equipment. And this is where all of\nGeorge Washington's ideals of justice and humanity\nreally start to dissolve. The US was becoming a\nmore powerful nation. They needed more land for\ntheir booming population. So the inpatient settlers and their government\nstarted playing dirty. - [Reporter] The westward movement was like a green tidal wave. - You start to see what happens\nwhen these tribes say no to the newly powerful United States. In one instance, one group of\ntribes up near the Great Lakes didn't wanna sell their land. They told the United States that this river would be the border and to not cross it,\nto stay off their land. The US said no. And they took them to war and lost twice. But on the third time, they won the battle and forced the tribes to\nsign a treaty giving away all of this land, basically\nall of present-day Ohio. Something very similar happened down here when the Seminole tribes\nrefused to leave their land, the US military came in,\nanother war killing thousands, forcing the tribes to sign a treaty and pushing them into the swampy interior of the state where they had no access to their farmland or the ocean. Down here in what was becoming Alabama, the Muskogee nation refused\nto sign a relocation treaty but not wanting to go to war, agreed to sell a portion of their land in return for a guarantee\nthat they could keep the rest. And the United States agreed,\nand they actually did. And the Muskogee kept their\nancestral lands forever. Wamp, wamp, no, that didn't happen. Four years later, a bunch\nof white settlers moved in, boxing the Muskogee out\nof their ancestral land. As tensions grew because\nof this violated agreement, the US military was called in to force the Muskogee out of their lands. No treaty was ever signed. I mean, the shenanigans\nranged the whole gamut here. They would get tribal\nleaders drunk to trick them into signing this paper\nthat gave them all the land. They would appoint random\npeople to be the tribal leaders and then tell them to sign away the land for the whole tribe. In another conflict, the\nSioux and Arapaho nations defeated the US military over and over until the US finally\nsigned a peace treaty, acknowledging their land. (text clicking) And they were safe until gold was discovered\neight years later and the US broke their\ntreaty, redrew the boundaries, built roads on their land. And before you know it, you've got a bunch of white guys with gold\npans harvesting this land. Treaties and justice be damned. (dramatic music) Eventually, other tribes caught onto what was gonna happen, realizing that refusing the US\ngovernment would mean violence. So they would sign the paper,\ntake the money and leave. Over the course of almost 100 years, the United States signed 368 treaties with tribal nations who\nwere driven out one way or another to make way for white settlers who established control over this land that their\ngovernment had stolen for them. And yes, you have all the paperwork, all the spreadsheets\nthat they were making, all the treaties, a nice paper trail but this was all a facade of justice, a thinly veiled campaign\nfor imperial conquest. (dramatic music) Before we go on to the story,\nI just needed to tell you that we don't have a\nsponsor for today's video. Lately, I've been hearing from some sponsors that my\nvideos are too political, which is kind of a bummer because we work really hard\nto tell really cool stories. And if that means that people don't want to\nsponsor us, that's fine. Luckily, we have a Patreon where all of you can support this work. It's called The Newsroom. We call it The Newsroom 'cause it just sounds cooler than Patreon. But it is a place where you\ncan support what we are doing, which is something more and more we need. On The Newsroom, you get\nan extra video every month. It's a behind-the-scenes\nvlog from all of the people and processes and happenings\naround here in the studio. You get to see my scripts. You get royalty free music\nfrom our composer, Tom Fox, that you can use in your\nvideos and live Q&As with me. Members of The Newsroom get\nto chat with me on a Q&A where they can ask me anything. But more importantly, you\nget the warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting independent journalism. And if that floats your\nboat, you can go to the link in my description,\npatreon.com/JohnnyHarris. Let's get back to the story. Okay, so we have all of this\nlike fake treaty shenanigans going on to help the United States feel like they're doing\njustice and it's working. They are moving loads of native people out of their ancestral lands so\nthat white people can settle it. But there was one region that\nproved particularly difficult for this extermination\nproject that was going down. Here in the deep south, you had these five large\nnations that lived side by side with the settlers for a long time. They had all signed treaties\nwith the United States that acknowledged their\nright to this land. Many of them spoke\nEnglish, practiced farming, wore European clothes,\nsome even owned slaves. Because of this, these five tribes, the\nCherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muskogee, and Seminole were known as the five civilized tribes. And there's an alternative\nworld where these tribes could have remained on their\nland living side by side with the Europeans as they settled. But that's not what happened, mostly because of cotton. (pensive music) Farmers down here were\ngetting super rich off of a very valuable cash crop called cotton that they could sell to\ntextile mills around the world. It was an industry made\neven more profitable by its key input: free\nlabor from stolen Africans. There was this one strip of land down here called\nthe Black Belt Prairie that was particularly\ndesirable for farming cotton. But as you can see, it was locked up in what the United States\ntreaties had formally acknowledged as belonging to Native Nations. But the farmers down here\nwere looking at this as like this is a perfect place to\nexpand our cotton kingdom. So these southern slave\nowners did what was kind of becoming US policy towards the people living on\nthe land that they wanted. They made up their own rules. The state of Georgia was\nparticularly aggressive in trying to clear this\nland out, or in the words of their governor at the\ntime to replace, quote, \"All of the red with white population.\" They targeted the Cherokee\nnation, passing a law that abolished their governments. The Cherokee are not gonna stand for this. So they fight back using\nthe same shenanigans that the United States is trying to use: the US legal system. They take Georgia to court,\na case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. And guess what? The Cherokee Nation won. Like there was no way around the fact that\nthey had ironclad rights to this land signed and sealed. The highest court in\nthe country just ruled that the states could not\nimpose on tribal sovereignty. But as we all learned in government class, a ruling from the\njudicial branch only works if the executive branch enforces it. Oh, and who was in charge\nof the executive branch? Oh, this guy. The guy who wrote a letter to his wife during the War of 1812\nfrom the battlefield saying that he had successfully\nslaughtered 170 Native Americans in quote, \"An elegant style.\" Oh, and the guy who's on our $20 bill. Yeah, him, Andrew Jackson thought that negotiating treaties with the people who were living here\nwas a ridiculous notion. So he looks at the Supreme Court ruling that validates the Cherokees\nright to their land. And he literally responds in the snarkiest way possible saying, the chief justice John\nMarshall has, quote, \"Made his decision. Now let him enforce it.\" No, he was not going to enforce it. Jackson had a different plan in mind. It came in the form of a new law that he pushed through\nboth Houses of Congress. His whole worldview towards\nFirst Americans embodied in a piece of American legislation, the Indian Removal Act of 1830. This law used taxpayer\nmoney to get tribes out of the United States, and to relocate them to\nan uninhabitable place that surely no American\nsettler will ever end up. - [Reporter] The great plains\nseemed an inhospitable land to people familiar with the\neastern states and of Europe. - This became their dumping ground and it came with a promise. Move here and we will\nnever mess with you again. And what's crazy to me is that even after all of the\nshenanigans, all the facades, they continued to play this\ncharade saying that the nation of Indians may choose\nto exchange their land where they now reside. The law says that the government had to negotiate these\ntreaties fairly, voluntarily, peacefully, and that the\ngovernment would, quote, \"Forever secure and guarantee\nthem their new land.\" And that they wouldn't break any of the preexisting agreements that they had made in previous treaties. But no, this was just more\npretending, a paper trail of pretend humanity. Just as Andrew Jackson had\nignored the Supreme Court ruling, he had no intention in following the law\nthat he helped create. But he kept up the ruse, more\ndocuments, more signatures, more paper that made these civilized justice-minded people feel like they weren't orchestrating\na mass ethnic cleansing sanctioned by the government,\npaid for by taxes. But they were. So this law is implemented and the United States government, military and even private\ncompanies start to ramp up their removal efforts of First Americans. They focused in on these five tribes that were sitting atop the land that they wanted for their cotton empire. More bribes, more pretend negotiations. And when push came to shove,\nmore threats of violence. The Cherokee eventually\nsigned a treaty agreeing to sell their last portion of land. And they moved west out\nto their little rectangle of land that had been allocated to them by the government on maps. The only problem was that the leader who signed the treaty on behalf of the Cherokee people was\nnot actually the real leader. They had no authority\nto make this decision. The Cherokee chief\nfuriously protested this but the US didn't care. They had their signature from someone. In their eyes, all was justified. (pensive music) Between 1831 and 1838, nearly every member from the five tribes was\nexpelled from their land. 100,000 people whose home this was now forced to walk by foot\nfor more than 1,000 miles through brutal weather and\nterrain towards a little box on the map, a place they\nhad never been before. The Cherokee would eventually\ncall this journey The Trail Where We Cried or The Trail of Tears. Some tried to fight back\nagainst their oppressors and others stood their ground\nuntil they were forcibly bound in chains by the US government\nand herded west at gunpoint. Their land was vacant and cotton farmers with their slaves moved\nin and the economy grew. (dramatic music) We'll never know how many\npeople died during all of this. How many lives were really destroyed. Some people say 3,000,\nother estimates say 15,000 but you don't need those numbers to see how destructive this was. It was systematic, it was documented and it was enshrined in law. We've a paper trail of all\nof it showing the receipts, the payments, the treaties,\nthe bureaucracy of it all. It's like a bunch of\nspreadsheets from the 1800s. American settlers, in an\neffort to be different from the Old World empires they fled, ended up carrying out the first state-sponsored\nethnic cleansing. There's a reason why\nHitler 100 years later references this exact event, this process when he was carrying out\nhis own ethnic cleansing. He said that the Volga,\nwhich is a river in Russia, would be, quote, \"Our Mississippi.\" He said that Europe, not America would be the land\nof unlimited possibilities. (dramatic music) The story of what happened to many nations of the First\nAmericans doesn't end here. In fact, this is kind of the beginning. We're gonna make a second\npart to this video. And in that part two, I wanna\nshow you what happens next once these tribes arrive to their little rectangle on\nthe map, Indian territory, the place where these\ntribes were forced out, dumped and left to build a new life and how they once again\ntried to fight back using the legal frameworks\nthat had pushed them out and how all of that led to\nthe establishment of one state in our country that could\nhave looked a lot different. (pensive music) Hey, thanks for watching this video. I need to tell you about something. We have a poster. I finally have a poster. I've been dreaming about this\nposter for a very long time. All maps are wrong and indeed they are. This poster shows dozens\nof map projections, all the weird quirky shapes that you get when you try to map a sphere,\nwhich is what our globe is onto a piece of paper, which\nis flat is available right now. You can go buy it and doing\nso supports this channel but it also gets you\na really sweet poster. We printed it on really nice paper. I spent a very long time\nnudging every one of these maps. I got help from some of my best friends and designers like Becki\nfrom Becki and Chris is like a really early\ngood graphic designer. I literally sent her the Illustrator file and I was like, \"Hey,\ncan you like do this?\" And she was like, \"I got you.\" So she made it better. Anyway, it's a fantastic cool thing and I'm really excited about it. So link in the description. We also have a big thing\ngoing on over at Patreon. A few thousand people are\nover there supporting us so that we can make more videos like this. Something I am very grateful for. So that's patreon.com/JohnnyHarris. What else do I need to tell you about? Maybe things like LUTs and presets. We use LUTs to color our videos. If I don't put my LUT on this\nvideo, it looks like this. Yeah. It'd be really bad. So we worked with a professional\ncolorist to make this LUT so that our videos look like\nthis and it's much better. So we do that also for photos of presets for\nlike Lightroom and stuff. Those are available in the description. This startup that I\nfounded a few years ago is still cruising along. Bright Trip. We're publishing courses about\ncool places around the world. You can go check that out. Boy, what else? I mean, more importantly, we're just gonna keep making videos. So thanks for being here. We'll see you in the next one. (hands knocking) End tag bonanza. Look at these people. (lively music)"

An impossibility made manifest\nby superhumans in the future. One of their fellow\nexplorers, Ernest Shakleton drew this place on the\nback of a menu once. Dreaming of someday crossing\nthis whole continent, and paying a huge price to try. This is a place that has\nlured explorers from all over, killing many of them. That's because the bottom\nof the earth is a place that humans really shouldn't go. It's a place that in\nfact, they couldn't go. (dramatic music) Hey, I'm super excited for you to see the rest of this video. First, I need to say\nthank you to Storyblocks for sponsoring today's video. I actually used Storyblocks\nto make this video. I didn't go to Antarctica for this video, I got a lot of this\nfootage from Storyblocks which is a giant repository\nof loads of tools that you can use to make your own videos. From over a million 4K\nand HD footage clips, animation templates, music, sound effects, images and more, I mean,\nit's a lot of stuff. It's all searchable, it's all there. You can download as much as you want for one monthly subscription. I've been using Storyblocks\nfor literally a decade before they ever came to\nsponsor me for a YouTube video, and it's kind of a\ndream to work with them. Recently, Storyblocks changed the game by creating a plug-in for\nAfter Effects and Premiere which are the programs we use to edit and animate our videos. What this means is you can\nbe inside of your editor and have access to all of this footage, so you're not like downloading it and moving it to a different folder, you're just grabbing it\nfrom the Storyblocks panel inside of your software. It's truly amazing, and I just found out that all of this footage\nthat I shot from Switzerland and Greenland is actually\nup on Storyblocks now. You can go and download\nas much as you want of my beautiful images from these places in addition to hundreds of thousands of other amazing visuals. This is an incredible service that comes at a very affordable price. It's a set price, there's\nnot like hidden fees. You can download as much stuff as you want for this one set price, my huge fan.

Let's get back to this\nvideo about Antarctica. Our species were able to move and settle across the whole whole globe from desolate ice deserts to\nimpossibly far away islands. Somehow we just showed up, we settled. But even after we had reached\nevery corner of the globe thousands of years ago, there was still one land mass that no human had ever laid their eyes on, but something had to exist\ndown here they thought, something to balance out\nall of the land in the north with land in the south. So explorers and map\nmakers continue to search, and on these maps they\ndrew their imaginary ideas. A giant continent somewhere down here, or maybe this island out in the east really extended down, like way down. Maybe there was palm trees and abundance, a new world yet to be discovered. Others mocked the idea\nof a southern world. They depicted it as a dystopian land full of kingdoms rife with immorality. But these were all guesses. It all remained unknowable. Too far away to find out. (dramatic music) By the end of the 1700's, explorers had turned most\nof the world's oceans from mysteries to fact. And it was only then that the vast ocean expanses of the south turned from imaginary musing into the next frontier of discovery. The newly enlightened map makers were now drawing precise grided lines to accurately audit the planet. They were done with their\npretend predictions, their monsters in place of knowledge. The map would remain empty until they had evidence to fill\nin those great blank spaces. Hopefully with earth's\nlost and last continent for thousands of years\nconjectured by many, but seen by none. So expeditions were launched\nmoving south and they failed. The southern seas were simply too vast. The gaps in our knowledge too big to take on this uncharted place. But in 1772, one captain would\nbegin to change everything. (dramatic music) He set sail with two ships and 192 men, and with him the latest technology: a new clock, the most precise\nclock ever made at the time and would for the first time allow him to determine his longitude,\nto map his every move, to give us the lines that we\ncan now show you on this map. This journey was funded\nby the all-consuming greed of an expanding empire, looking\nfor new soil to exploit. But him personally, he had big\nthings going on in his mind. He was in it for the desire to go south, further south than any man had ever gone and as far south as any\nman could possibly go. He wanted to be the one\nto find the lost continent at the bottom of our planet. So for three years, he scoured the oceans, yet searching in the temperate latitudes all he found was water. So he decided to cross a line that no one before him had\ncrossed, the Antarctic Circle. (dramatic music) In case it's not clear, we're now looking at\nthe bottom of the world. And this map is actually a story. It's a story of a doggedly\ndetermined explorer, spending years of his life\ncircling these oceans, dipping more south than\nany human had ever traveled then coming up and then dipping down again just in case this time\nhe might find something, but all he found was frozen water, floating ice, sharp and perilous, but he kept on looking for ways in. On a couple of occasions he reached within\nbreathing distance of land but he never caught sight of it. After years of searching it\nwas finally time to head home. He didn't find the continent, but what he did do was prove that if this fable land existed, it would not be the bountiful paradise that people had imagined and hoped for. He had scoured nearly every\ninch of those latitudes. Instead, he knew that any land down here would be a desolate world, \"Forever buried in snow and ice.\" So more explorers go and attempt to do what\nCaptain Cook couldn't and 45 years later they find something. It was the lost continent and humans were laying eyes\non it for the first time. No, it was not temperate,\nbut barren and merciless, but it was seen, it existed. For human beings, a moment like this doesn't\nmean the end of a goal, it actually just means the very beginning. So they don't stop here, soon more ships are heading south, explorers looking to claim\nland for their country, seal hunters, whale hunters looking for new untouched waters, scientists on boats with\nmeasuring tools and open minds recording everything. The unknown place, a little more known, sketched on paper the\nshape of a land mass. But these records only\nserved as a new measurement of our ignorance, how much we didn't know. Our discoveries were still\nscattered and partial, accrued shape, a ghost\nof something much bigger. To truly unveil Antarctica's mysteries, we needed to venture inside it. A few years would need to pass before the people with power would turn their attention slightly away from mapping and conquering\nthe non-icy world to supporting the full exploration\nof this desolate place. But eventually they got on board. They needed to know what existed in the last blank land on the map. By then they had unleashed\nthe magic of mechanical power. Power that was fed by\ncarbon from ancient trees turned into black gold,\nlocked deep in the earth. This new power allowed them to navigate the once impossible ice,\nunlocking the perilous interior. On board these boats were scientists, explorers ready to ask\nand answer new questions, armed with new methods, new\ntools, progress, discovery, adventure, and of course,\nthe French being French. Soon it's 1911 and there's a race to see who can get to the South Pole first. And it's the Norwegian group who does. The British team gets there second and everyone dies on their way back and the map is shaping up. New goals come to replace old ones, we now need to cross Antarctica\nthrough the the pole, going through the ominous\nunexplored region on the map. A guy named Shakleton tried this, but didn't make it very far. But his journey became a tale of courage and the will to live, when he and his crew against all odds in some of the most hostile circumstances managed to all return home. The expeditions of that\nperiod reset the standards of human limits and bit\nby bit, line by line, the void on the map was\ngradually getting filled in. By 1920, you're seeing maps like this, a red shading on the parts that we know and yet still so much left unknown. After millennia of dreaming of it, we finally and indisputably\nconquered the skies. We were now able to lay our\neyes on uncharted territories at an unprecedented scale. The first airplane flew\nover the South Pole in 1928 and in the next decade,\nmany more would follow, each flight providing more detail to add to the compendium of\nhard fought observations. But as much as it is a part\nof our nature to explore and learn, it is also a part of our\nnature to conquer and dominate. In the aftermath of the most\ncatastrophic war humanity had ever known, humans once again revealed\ntheir little eternal paradox, that their love for exploration was often as much about\nconquest and control as it was about learning\nand understanding. Petty fights about who owned\nthis land came to the surface and thus on the maps, more and more we see\nthese shades of colors, unnaturally straight lines\nthat indicate who owns what. Scientific research stations\nstopped the icy surface, flying national flags, established as much for\nasserting territorial control as for science. And now it's a new world\nwhere the two superpowers had turned the map into their\nchess board for influence. Both were now looking for a share of what was still earth's\nlargest unexplored territory. And soon the United States\nis making maps like this, that has a whole shade color dedicated to land that has been seen\nexclusively by American eyes. It's a map that says we were here first, creating a paper trail\nthat they could point to just in case they needed to stake a claim here at the bottom of the planet. But then the countries get together and they make an agreement that Antarctica was not\nmeant to be just a new field for our conflicts, but rather a place for scientific inquiry. So scientists keep coming\nenabled by better technology. Icebreakers and helicopters are\nunloaded onto the continent. But despite all the progress, this continent remains unknown\nand potentially unknowable. That's until humans break a\nseemingly impossible barrier. By escaping the force of\ngravity that kept us bound to our home planet, we're now throwing up spherical machines with cameras on them into space. Countries use these\nsatellites to snap photos of their enemies on giant roles of film and gold canisters, that would fill up and then be ejected back down into the sky intercepted by an airplane. And now, yes, we have photos\nof what our enemy is up to, but look, we also just\nhave photos of the earth, seeing it like never before. (upbeat music) These terrestrial outlines\nthat old cartographers would tediously reconstruct with only the help of\nscattered observations, math, and plenty of imagination, now readily available to\nus, with perfect accuracy. Our maps were no longer educated guesses, they were snapshots of reality, thanks to our satellites\nhurling around our planet once every a hundred or so minutes, taking photos and making\nmeasurements while they fly. Humans have outdone themselves now. We have more data than our human brains could possibly comprehend. It's too much. It's basically worthless due to its scale, its detail, its complexity, until new electronic brains appear, allowing us to collect and\nsynthesize hundreds of thousands of images from space,\nblending them into one map. (dramatic music) A map that explores who broke\ninto this desolate place a hundred years earlier\ncould have never imagined. Every nook and cranny\nof Antarctica is seen. Every hill, every curve, every valley, every cliff, every ledge. But we don't stop there. Now let's measure the radiation emitted from the icy surface. We can measure the chemistry\nof the atmosphere down here, the temperature of its oceans, the velocity of its ice\nsheets as they move. We can somehow even map what this place would look like if you\nremoved all the ice. Ice, that let me remind you, is four kilometers thick in some places. Scientists soon declare that Antarctica, the place that was always\ninaccessible to humans is now the best mapped continent on earth. This generation's long\nquest to map Antarctica is ultimately a story of\nstruggle and then triumph. A story of exploration and science. And to me it's rock solid\nproof of something that seems to be deeply embedded\ninto the human experience, the obsession to discover, regardless of the cost and despite the lack of any\nrational reason to do so, always driven by these\ntwin motives of curiosity and conquest. Always willing to do whatever it takes to step foot in a place no\nmatter how impossible it seems. So yes, we've basically\nentirely mapped Antarctica and the entire planet at that, but you know we're not gonna stop here. As new frontiers reveal\ntheir mysteries to us, the same story is bound to unfold, and I can say with certainty\nthat we will continue to do this, not because\nwe need to for survival, but because we need to\nfor some other reason, some deeply human impulse that pushes us way past what's reasonable into the impossible, to expand the frontiers of our knowledge, to understand ourselves and our surroundings a little better, to discover the truths of\nour world and our universe. (dramatic music) Hey everyone, thanks for watching. This was a new format, obviously, one I'm really excited about though because we poured a lot into making this beautiful and immersive, Tom and I developed this soundtrack in a very, very bespoke, tailor-made way. And my hope is that it really stuck. I know for me, this is one of my favorite\nvideos we've ever made. I wanna tell you about something because I'm very excited about this. I made a poster. It is a poster called All Maps Are Wrong, and it features dozens of map projections. We can't accurately map\nthe world on a 2D surface because the world is a sphere, right? And so we get all these\nweird map projections. And they're beautiful to look at, they're kind of weird to look at. We just launched this right now, it's literally, this is the first time I'm talking about it to you right now. And what that means is\nthere is a presale discount. 15% off for this week only.

And a while back I was like,\u00a0\u00a0 does the United States have any big super\u00a0\ncool bridges that do all this cool stuff,\u00a0\u00a0 like in the ocean? Turns out we do. It's\u00a0\nnot nearly as big, but we have this bridge,\u00a0\u00a0 the Chesapeake Bridge, which is four and a half\u00a0\nmiles long. And apparently it's the scariest\u00a0\u00a0 bridge in America. I've driven over this bridge\u00a0\na bunch because it's like 20 miles from my house,\u00a0\u00a0 and I never thought it was that scary.

The U.N. was actually there trying\u00a0\nto kind of stop it, but they didn't. It's easy\u00a0\u00a0 to think that the U.N. is like this big like\u00a0\nglobal policeman, or like that it has some power,\u00a0\u00a0 but the U.N. is just composed of a bunch of\u00a0\ncountries.

It's one of several\u00a0\ninstances in the 1990s that the U.N. could\u00a0\u00a0 have stepped in and stop horrible things from\u00a0\nhappening, but didn't.

And so we just love MSG and that's how you're\nable to take a chip like a Dorito, which is just like a refined corn paste that has been\nsmashed and then like fried and baked and make it so delicious.

everyone's talking about it and we gotta talk about it because something big is going on here as of this morning Silicon Valley Bank or svb has gone under completely the second biggest bank collapse in U.S history the bank is called the Silicon Valley Bank or if we're going to call it svb in this video it is the epicenter of tech startups venture capital and it is now effectively dead the government is scrambling to keep us all calm while this Bank fails your deposits will be there when you need them the American banking system is really safe and well capitalized that's because we live in a system that doesn't work if everyone freaks out at the same time the system relies on all of us keeping a feeling of safety if that doesn't happen the system falls apart and that's what I'm going to explain today so let me show you how this happened how this Bank failed and what it means for you and me but more importantly how this moment teaches us that our bank accounts are kind of a lie we're gonna have to do something different here we're actually rescuing depositors in banks that made some bad decisions over the course of the last year or so Americans can have confidence the banking system is safe okay so let's talk about Banks all this is done with credit credit created by the bank out of the deposits made by all of us banks are actually pretty nuts we think of a bank as like a place where we take our money and store it like we give our money to the bank people and they go put it in a giant Vault and it is safe until we need it but that is not what is happening in reality banks are doing something pretty magical when you give them your money what they do is actually at the heart of our modern society our modern economy it's what makes a lot of things work let me explain let's get a little bit more insight on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank okay for this let's get back to the old collage of the macro economy as we've done in previous videos let's say I put ten thousand dollars into my bank what's insane is that the bank only has to keep 10 of that money in the actual bank 10 percent so that's like a thousand dollars of my ten thousand dollars the other nine thousand dollars they can go out and invest with and make money on using my money they can go invest it this often means giving out loans to people and collecting interests okay so nine thousand of my dollars gets loaned out to let's say a baguette business who is in need of a business loan because they need a new oven my bank gives the baker my money and charges interest on that loan and they actually give me a little bit of that interest that they've made to say like hey thanks for letting me use your nine thousand dollars so the baguette business now has nine thousand of my dollars and I don't actually know this because I kind of think that my money is in a vault somewhere so now the baker with his new loan goes and buys his oven for nine thousand dollars and the oven seller takes that nine thousand dollars and goes and puts it in their bank and guess what their Bank does the exact same thing that my bank did with my money but now they're doing it with their money which is kind of my money they only have to keep ten percent in their vaults so they only have to put nine hundred dollars in the vault they've got 8 100 that they can lend out and look there's a family who's looking to spend money on a home and they need a loan okay wait are you seeing what's Happening Here I gave 10 grand to my bank and now that money has magically duplicated a few times to make more money like real money that can be used to buy things an oven and then a house this continues to happen over and over and over my 10 grand just keeps getting used to be lent out put into another bank and then lent out again in fact if you model this out on a nerdy spreadsheet which is something I like to do you'll see that if I deposited ten thousand dollars in the bank ten thousand dollars is added to the system but then for each one of these transactions more and more money gets added to the system this is the aggregate of all of the money being added to the system my ten thousand dollars turns into this look what happens look just keeps going and going and eventually it effectively 10 X's it sort of flat lines out at a hundred thousand dollars what my ten thousand dollars just turned into a hundred thousand dollars into the economy because of weird mental constructs yes that is our modern Financial system it is amazing and it's kind of mind-blowing okay this magical thing is called the money multiplier effect and it relies on the reserve ratio that the requirement that banks have like the amount that they have to keep in in this case 10 which is like the real Reserve ratio right now you can do this calculations like one over the reserve ratio and it sort of gives you this multiplier effect of your money the crazy thing is the lower the reserve ratio like if your bank only had to keep five percent of your money in the more money would be created out in the economy but the riskier that would be for you if the reserve ratio was like 50 if they had to keep fifty percent of your money then like that's safer for you but now you're not like priming the pump of like giving all of this money to the economy to like make transactions and build businesses and build capitalism so the reserve ratio is like 10 right now which means that a bank that has a hundred million dollars from all of its customers really only has to have 10 million dollars in its vault at all times and the other 90 million is out doing its work in the economy multiplying itself and making a return for the bank and giving you a little interest rate and the bank is secretly the whole time like please everyone don't come withdraw your money at the same time because we don't actually have it just please thanks okay so this is slightly scary right like the bank only has 10 of my money feels kind of risky I thought Banks were like the safest place to put your money it's not like I'm doing some hardcore like risky Stock Investing maybe I should take all my money out of my bank account and put it under my mattress so that the bank isn't like playing around with it well no let's actually not do that please because if we did our economy would miss out on this amazing magical multiplier effect that turns my 10 grand into a hundred grand and our economy would literally be a fraction as prosperous as it is the reality is we don't have to worry and I'm going to explain that to you in a sec but I first need to thank the sponsor of today's video thanks to today's sponsor incogni some of you may have remembered that a few years ago I made a video about junk mail and like the original framing of that video was I was going to go on a war on junk mail I was going to try to unsubscribe from everything and see if I could rid my life of junk mail unfortunately the video turned into just an explainer about how my data is bought and sold and I gave up on the whole unsubscribe from all of the junk in this world why because it was impossible many of us don't know that our data our personal information is packaged and sold on an open market in this shadowy industry of data Brokers and not just like one or two data Brokers hundreds this is a very lucrative industry the bad news is navigating the system to successfully extricate yourself from it is really difficult it's incredibly tedious by design it would literally take years this is where incognate comes in and cognate is a service that you give permission to go out and remove you from all of these lists to get you out of this system it's not an easy process trust me I tried it but incognia is set up to do this they reach out to data Brokers on your behalf and request that your information be removed and then they deal with the aftermath if they run into any issues with their yearly subscription incogni consistently is monitoring for you protecting your data and making sure that you don't end up back in this system it's actually been pretty fascinating for me to look at the dashboard in incognitive and looking and realizing that I'm on over a hundred of these lists which explains why my email inbox is like a disaster and why my phone is ringing all day from like random Robo calls but it's also personal safety like you don't want someone knowing where you live and what you're up to it's just like get me out of this system so I created an account and then gave incognate permission just like with a click and now here they're off to the thing they've sent out 148 requests to data Brokers I've already been removed off of 33 of these lists I can't tell you how satisfying this is I finally have a tool to fight back against this shadowy industry so the first hundred people to click the link in my description get 60 off using this service it is incognito.com Johnny Harris make sure to use the code Johnny Harris help support this channel also get you in on the deal thank you and Cockney for sponsoring this video and for existing I'm very appreciative let's get back to the video okay so Banks only hold on to 10 of my money in the other 90 they are investing in the world and this is kind of scary governments know that this is kind of scary and they also know that our society and our our economy is built on us keeping our money in the bank not freaking out not everyone all of a sudden going and pulling it out so to make us all sleep better at night they promise that if a bank ever does anything Reckless with our money or they accidentally lose it while they're out there investing that the government will make up the difference that the government will pay us back for any money that we lost at least up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars it's kind of like a everyone stay calm will pay back if you lose it just don't everyone go at the same time and pull out your money please the whole system relies on it can we just chill and we can chill as long as we don't have more than 250 000 in our bank account anyway this is kind of works for most people most people don't have 250 000 lying around but what about businesses businesses have to use Banks they have expenses every month like payroll and rent a tech company like Roku had 500 million dollars in Silicon Valley Bank and at this time the company does not know to what extent they'll be able to recover that cash companies like this need way more than 250 000 to cover their costs so the question is how do they feel safe and this is where we get back to Silicon Valley Bank these Dynamics become very strange when you're talking about the customers being a bunch of businesses do you have the money Jitters ask your nearest Bank of America branch for a jar of soothing instant money okay so Silicon Valley Bank is the bank for businesses particularly Tech startups in California and unsurprisingly ninety percent of their customers had more than the 250 000 sort of Mark where the government will insure you so a lot of that money is not insured by anyone they just trust their bank and that's fine Banks aren't out there taking their customers money and like making super risky Bets with it this bank has been operating for 40 years and it's been doing just fine but what happens next is a perfect storm of events that led this bank to sink where is he peekaboo let's make a list for this here we go the anatomy of a collapse of a big bang first they invested a lot of their customers money like every Bank does in this case they invested in government bonds which is a totally safe investment it's an investment to put your money in for a certain amount of time like 10 years and the government will pay you interest on that money based on the federal interest rate the interest rate you know the thing that the FED puts up and down to sort of help put brakes on the economy the thing is though when svb bought these bonds it was like last year and the year before back when rates were very very low okay not a great return for them but it was fine it was a safe investment if they just waited out the time period of the bond they would get all their money back plus a little return okay but then what happens next economist expect a rate hike of three quarters of a percent to help drive down inflation the government starts to raise interest rates they're doing this to help Stave off inflation stabilize the economy the government is doing this thing called raising interest rates that's fine what it means is that people buying bonds today are going to get a better rate of return those bonds are more valuable now today so svb who bought their bonds a couple years ago when interest rates were super low and if they ever wanted to sell those bonds early they're now competing with interest rates that are a lot higher and so their bonds are actually worth much less if they had to sell them today they would lose money okay but again that's fine just hold on to your bonds until the the whole maturity schedule happens and then the government will give you all your money back with your little return everything is okay okay but here's the next part of the perfect storm that really starts to heat all this up remember that svb's customers are startups startups raise money from Venture funds and they take that money and they deposit it into svb and that is how svb gets its money to operate to invest with but during this recent economic downturn startups haven't been able to raise as much money and thus svb hasn't had as much money coming in the door and so they start pulling on their reserves and they realize they kind of have to figure out a way to get more money and it's not going to come from startups because startups aren't raising so they turn to their bonds they're like we've got tons of our customers money in these really safe bonds they're at low interest rates we probably need to sell some of them off to like get some cash in our reserves to like meet all of our needs and the withdrawals and all of that so they sell off a bunch of their bonds and this is where things start to go really really wrong they announced that they're selling their bonds and they have to sell them early and yes we bought them at a lower interest rate and now the interest rate is higher so we're actually selling them at a loss and that loss is actually two billion dollars okay like again banks have to deal with this kind of stuff this isn't great for them but it's far from lethal but then this is where it starts to get really bad they go out and announce that they're going to be raising money from other investors they're like going out looking for money they're like hey yeah we sold off the bonds we also need you guys to invest in our bank so that we can just stay good everyone stay calm it's not a big deal we just need to raise a little money everyone stay calm but the best way to like get people to freak out is to be like stay calm it's actually not the big of a deal we're fine we just need to raise some money and we're selling bonds at a loss oh my God okay it's happening every everybody what's the procedure okay so now the moment that deals the final blow to all of this all of these Founders and Venture firms they're all talking to each other because they're all in the same community in the same area all in the same business they're all in the same WhatsApp groups and they're all like hey guys uh what's going on with svb all of our bank why are they raising money why are they selling their bonds early is my money not safe and so like a herd of bison frightened by a loud bang a stampede of very wealthy Founders and startups in central California start pulling out their money from svb trying to stay safe what you're seeing behind me is customers of Silicon Valley Bank lined up to make sure that they can get their money they know that their accounts aren't insured by the government because they have way too much money and so they don't feel like their money is safe and they take it all out I need money how am I going to live until the bank opens to play I need cash how much do you need on Wednesday alone customers pulled out 42 billion dollars which was a quarter of what the bank was worth word spreads to Wall Street that this is happening and svb's stock begins to tank the bank stock lost 80 percent of its value this week 60 in one day alone yesterday which makes it even harder for them to go out and raise new money to meet all of the demands of people withdrawing drawing drawing their money there is a panic or as we call it a run on the bank and so just like that svb ran out of cash because all of their customers tried to get their money out at the same time and were reminded that the modern banking system is built off of banks only having a fraction of your money while the rest of it is out in the economy turning into more money we don't want to be reminded of this very often but when we are it's kind of scary so the government swoops in to take over the ship oh but not before the bank Executives could pay themselves a bunch of bonuses because they're banking people and this is what banking people tend to do so yes by Friday Federal Regulators stepped in and seized control of svb's assets it'll go down as the second largest bank collapse in history right behind 2008's Washington Mutual meltdown so since the very beginning of the modern Financial system the government has played an important role in making us feel safe about our bank accounts even though our bank accounts are a bunch of mental constructs and really just a list of ious plus 10 of your actual money they don't want us to think that way because if we do chaos happens and the system collapses you're you're thinking of this place all wrong as if I had the money back on a safe the money's not here well your money's in Joe's house that's right next to you doors and in the Kennedy house on Mrs maclin's house and a hundred others so when a bank actually does collapse they have to go into hyper mode this is why all the like government people were like working overtime on the weekends and the first round of intervention the first thing they need to do is just words Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe today is about not sinking the boat that we are all in like this is really important they need to say that like the government is there to protect this money like you don't need to go panic and take all your money out of the bank you are fine you are insured because Panic spreads like a contagion you know this feeling like when you feel a sense of panic it will just spread you don't want to be the last person to act because and we have some cautionary tales in the 1930s 9 000 banks failed there were huge runs on all of these Banks there was no 250 000 insurance so people got worried and took all their money out at the same time and the whole thing collapsed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis 500 banks failed and if you remember there were some banks that were so big that would have been so catastrophic if they failed that taxpayers came and bailed them out gave them all the money to make good on all of their needs this is how important it is and in this case the government pulled out all the stops to get everyone their money back over the weekend the Biden Administration took Extraordinary Measures to guarantee anyone who had accounts with the collapse Banks would be able to get back all of their money regardless of the amount again 90 of the customers of svb had accounts of over 250 000 and they weren't insured and yet the government was able to give them their money back technically they didn't use taxpayer money to do this we don't think we're not sure but it was actually like a fund that all the banks paid into so whether or not this is like another bailout bailout bailout bailout bailout is hotly debated and it will continue to be debated anyway the big debate that I'm thinking about here is whether or not the government should let Banks fail or if they should always swoop in and save them when you let Banks fail you force them to feel the consequences of their decisions on how they manage their Banks but when you let Banks fail you also create this feeling of anxiety that is contagious and right now there already is a bit of an economic anxiety flooding around our country inflation is high there's war there's increased competition with China and trade barriers people are slightly on edge and so the government swooped in with 150 percent of their might to make everyone feel safe they didn't want to ignite this into another 2008 style meltdown this was the safer approach I guess for me I'm slightly concerned that this may lead to just more Reckless risk-taking because we're kind of sending a signal to these banks that like hey if you fail even the kind of smaller ones we will probably bail you out which again is a good thing this helps quell any chaos especially in the short term we don't have people freaking out we have no reason to go run and pull out all of our money now and importantly people who have money in small Regional Banks feel secure they're not going to take out all their money and put it in like banks that are too big to fail but in the long run it could just mean banks will feel emboldened to continue with bigger and bigger bets knowing that the government will bail them out knowing that there's not real consequences knowing that they'll get their bonuses so the debate is heating up now in a new way you're going to see a lot of fighting you're gonna see a lot of Elizabeth Warren who's very smart on this stuff and also very bullish about regulating Banks there will be another financial crisis of course when the crash comes the big banks will throw up their hands and say it's not their fault nobody could have seen it coming and then they'll run to Congress and beg for bailout money and let's be blocked I'll probably get it and what happens next is we will witness if this government intervention actually worked if the government successfully calmed us all down so that the system can keep going or if this Panic will continue to spread leading to more Bank runs more failed Banks and a stark reminder that our modern Financial system is a mental construct that leads us to all work together for the prosperity and growth of our society until that is The Dominoes start to fall they knew the taxpayers would bail them out they weren't being stupid they just didn't care yeah because they're [\u00a0__\u00a0] Crooks but at least we're going to see some of them go to jail right we didn't have to break up the banks party's over I don't know I don't know I have a feeling that in a few years people are going to be doing what they always do when the economy tanks they will be blaming immigrants and poor people"

    "video_id": "czQrU0OPIR8",
    "captions": "- It's 1991 and the Soviet\nUnion is fracturing. And down here, another communist party is failing. Yugoslavia, a federation of six countries is ripping itself apart. Their economy is in ruin and they're replacing\ncommunism with nationalism, the kind that thrives on focusing on ethnic and religious differences. By the end of 1991, Croatia,\nSlovenia and Macedonia have all declared independence. Macedonia is allowed to leave peacefully, but Slovenia and Croatia fight wars to be independent from Yugoslavia. And then you have Serbia, populated primarily by Christian Serbs and they were not going to let\nYugoslavia fully fall apart. Together with Montenegro, they attempt to become the\nsuccessor state to Yugoslavia. After all, it was they who held\nthe most power in Yugoslavia and who comprised the\nmajority of the Yugoslav army. They didn't want independent states, they wanted to hold onto their majority, to their power. Another country in this\ncrumbling federation was the Socialist Republic\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Almost half of this country were Bosnian Muslims called Bosniaks and about a third were Christian Serbs, similar to the Christian\nSerbs living up here, but living in Bosnia. The other 17% were Croats. For a long time, these\ngroups had lived side by side in relative peace. They had a common ideology, communism, the idea of Yugoslavia. But as all these new\ncountries were being created, no one wanted to end up in a new nation controlled by the other side. So it's late 1991 and\na largely Croat region declares itself an\nindependent state from Bosnia. It wasn't recognized internationally. While some Croat leaders want to secede from the country entirely, they first agree to cooperate with the government of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, acting like a state within a state. The next year, Bosnia\nholds an independence vote. 63% of the population turns out and the results are that\n99% of the voters say yes, they want to be independent\nfrom Yugoslavia. These numbers imply that it\nwas mostly Bosniaks that voted, with the Bosnian Serbs boycotting the vote as most were against becoming\na minority in a new Bosnia. So after the independence vote passed, the Bosnian Serbs declared their own state within the borders of Bosnia. It was called Republika Srpska. No one recognized this\nnew self-declared country besides one and it was\nthe one that mattered. Serbia and Montenegro now had this leader, an important part of the story. His name was Slobodan Milosevic. He recognizes the new\nSerb state within Bosnia and this marks the start\nof the Bosnian war. (dramatic music) Hey, before we dive into this, I just need to tell you that we don't have a sponsor for today because it's sort of hard to find sponsors for videos like this. Luckily, the subscribers over at Nebula help make these videos possible. We publish our videos there\nevery week, a week early. So our next week's video about Antarctica, one of my favorite videos\nwe've ever made ever, it's freaking beautiful, is up now on Nebula. You can go watch it. It's $2.50 a month and it helps support us\nmaking videos like this. I'll give more detail on\nthat at the end of the video. For now, let's dive into this. Now, before we go on, we have to look back up here at Serbia, this leader, Slobodan Milosevic. This guy was a hyper nationalist. He made his career\nstirring up ethnic tensions between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. So he's seen all of this as a good thing, as an opportunity to further his vision of creating a new greater Serbian nation across the former Yugoslavia. And remember, Serbia is where the capital of the former Yugoslavia was. The Yugoslav army is dominated by Serbs, so Milosevic is able to\ndirect this professional army to launch an offensive, to help the Serbians in Bosnia secure their new claimed territory. (guns firing) To fight back, the Bosniaks\nand Croats form an alliance to protect their own\nchances of independence. But Serbs have this large\nprofessional army on their side. It's much more powerful and it quickly surrounds\nthe Bosnian capital city, positioning tanks, artillery and snipers on the hills around the city, blocking roads and supply routes. Their goal is to take the\ncapital as fast as possible and to end this war quickly. They start firing indiscriminately, attacking civilian populations with tanks, artillery and sniper fire, killing thousands in a siege\nthat would last for years. And while this city was majority Bosniak, Croats and Serbs lived there too, but the Serbs pummeled it anyway. The UN quickly attempts to negotiate with Milosevic and Serb forces and they reach a quick agreement to withdraw the Yugoslav army. But what really happens\nis the Yugoslav army just gives up control of\naround 100,000 Serb troops who mostly continue fighting\nfor the Serbs in Bosnia. As Yugoslav forces withdraw from Sarajevo as part of this agreement, the retreating forces are\nattacked by Bosniak troops. An unknown number of Yugoslav\narmy personnel are killed. Bosniak commanders would later be charged with war crimes for this attack. As the war rages on, Serbs escalate the brutality\nall over the country, routinely identifying Bosniak homes, ransacking and burning them down, rounding up civilians, separating the men from the women and sending the men to concentration camps or executing them. Women are sent to prisons\nwhere they suffer abuses and human rights violations that I'm not going to describe here for how atrocious they are. You can go to the sources for details. The point here is that\nwhat the Serbs are doing is starting to look\nlike an ethnic cleansing of the land they claimed. Meanwhile, the international community is hesitant to get too involved beyond cutting off the Yugoslav\neconomy with sanctions. And the UN sends food, medicine\nand peacekeeping soldiers, they also cut off the flow\nof weapons from the outside. But the UN mostly sticks to\nits peacekeeping principles, not interfering in the conflict, not stopping the advance of the Serbs or the ongoing ethnic\ncleansing that has begun. But the situation in\nBosnia is getting worse. The alliance between Bosniaks\nand Croats is falling apart. They start fighting each other. So now, Bosniak forces are\nfighting the Serbs on one side and their former allies,\nthe Croats, on the other, a war within a war. As this new complicated\nstage of the conflict starts, Croat forces surround and begin an attack in the city of Mostar, a city that the two had\nonce defended together back in 1992 against the Serbs. Croat forces capture large\nportions of the city. They blow up Bosniak mosques and murder Bosniak\ncivilians in their wake. Things are getting bad and in response to these\nworsening conditions in Bosnia, the UN gets NATO forces to come to Bosnia to enforce a no-fly zone, basically committing them\nto shoot down any planes flying over the country. But this does nothing to\nstop the ethnic cleansing that continues to escalate on the ground. So the next year, the UN\nestablishes safe zones across the country to protect\ncivilians fleeing the war, particularly Bosniaks who\nare fleeing ethnic cleansing by the Serb armies. But the UN is only as powerful as its member nations are\nwilling to let them be. And it turns out member\nnations are not willing to commit enough troops to actually fortify these safe zones. Serb forces regularly show up and attack the civilians\nin these safe zones. The United States who's still trying to stay out of this war helps negotiate peace between\nthe Croats and the Bosniaks, thus ending the war within the war. They sign an agreement in March of 1994 reestablishing the Federal Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and most importantly,\nthey renew their alliance to fight against the Serbs. Things slowly start to change in 1994. Bosnian Serbs decline a\npeace deal offered by the UN. In response, Milosevic, who's\nnow feeling the consequences of being cut off from the global economy now cuts ties with the Bosnian Serbs, refusing to send them\nmore weapons and money. He wants to remain in power, controlling his new Yugoslavia in hopes that cutting ties\nwith the Bosnian Serbs who are doing all these terrible things will convince the West to\nbegin trading with him again. So Milosevic's support is now gone, but even still, the Bosnian Serbs continue their campaign of horror, committing atrocities\nall over the country. But it's not just the Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats have also devolved into committing terrible\nviolent human rights abuses against civilians. As the war rages on, NATO continues to enforce\ntheir no-fly zone, shooting down a Serb jet and getting more and more\npulled into this conflict as Serb forces get bolder. Former President Jimmy\nCarter travels to Bosnia and negotiates a four-month ceasefire. It mostly holds with a few exceptions, but the ceasefire expires. They can't agree on a new one and the fighting starts again. Serb forces are able to steal\nheavy weapons from the UN and then use them to kill civilians. NATO continues to ramp up airstrikes. Serb forces respond by taking\nUN peacekeepers hostage and shooting down a US F-16. Serb forces are feeling\nemboldened at this point. They have consistently held around 70% of the land in Bosnia and even pushed back UN peacekeepers without major consequences. And they see an opportunity for one last big offensive to end the war and secure all of this land. They just need to take\nover the UN safe zones, kick the UN out and then take Sarajevo\nwith overwhelming force. (playful music) (explosions boom) So they target the town of Srebrenica, a UN safe zone where\nnearly 10,000 Bosniaks are seeking refuge. The UN had taken away their weapons. They were totally unarmed,\nbut protected by UN forces. On July 11th, 1995, 2,000 Serb Soldiers march into the town. They meet no resistance\nfrom the UN soldiers who decided to maintain their neutrality and defend supplies and\nfood for their refugees instead of the people themselves. But these UN soldiers were\nreally just 370 Dutch soldiers. They were outmatched anyway. So some retreat, others are captured. The Serb forces then round up 8,000 Bosniak men and boys and then they systematically execute them, comprising the deadliest\ngenocide on European soil since World War II. (speaker speaks in a foreign language) The surviving refugees abandoned by the international community flee the violence in Srebrenica. They fled to other areas telling the stories of this mass murder. The UN would later report that all sides violated\nthe Geneva Conventions, but described the Serb offensive as, quote, systematic ethnic cleansing. And at this point, the United States can no longer stand by and watch this happen. So in late 1995, the\nClinton administration pursues a new strategy. They plan for the UN to\neventually pull out of Bosnia, the US and NATO would keep them safe. The plan also ensured that\nthe US would be allowed to send weapons to the Bosnian government. The US then proposed the peace plan, one that divided Bosnia into two entities, one for Serbs and one for Bosniaks. These regions would have some autonomy and Bosniaks would control\n51% of the country. Both sides considered the US' plan, but the fighting continued. But now with the international community squarely on their side, the Croats conduct a\nsuccessful offensive in 1995 that takes back significant\nland from the Serbs and the Bosniaks gain momentum in the war. The balance of power is shifting, which forces the Serbs back\nto the negotiating table to cut their losses. After many rounds of negotiation and with the Serb forces seeing the tide of the\nwar turn against them, the Dayton Accords are\nsigned in December, 1995, by the presidents of\nCroatia, Bosnia and Serbia. - On behalf of all of us who would come to see\nthis peace take hold, you have seen what war has wrought. You know what peace can bring. - It was this agreement\nthat eventually gave us these modern borders that\ndivide the country into two. You have the Federation\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina which is composed mostly of\nBosniaks and Bosnian Croats. And over here, the Republika Srpska composed mostly of Bosnian Serbs, which is somewhat independent with its own political system and its own judiciary, but it's still a part of\nBosnia and her Herzegovina. So the war is over. Around 100,000 people\ndied during this violence and many more millions were\nforced to flee from their homes, the majority of which\nwere Bosnian Muslims. A United Nations criminal tribunal eventually tried 161 people for various war crimes\ncommitted during this war. Slobodan Milosevic went to jail for the rest of his life because of his crimes against humanity, his war crimes and genocide. He died before the end of his trial. The war reshaped this country, solidifying the ethnic divides that had been at the root of the conflict. Today, Bosniaks, Serbs and\nCroats live in relative peace, though the country faces\nnew threats to that peace, threats that are facing\nlots of parts of the world, rising nationalism, a reverence for former Serb war criminals and more calls for Serb independence. The memory of the atrocities committed during this conflict still haunts this place, both in the physical scars on the land, but most powerfully in the\nbodies and minds of its people. (somber music) This is a complicated story and there are lots of feelings about it. People watching this probably disagree with the way that I frame certain things, but we did our best to be fair and factual and to give the best overview we could. As I said earlier, finding sponsors for videos like this is difficult and I really value those\nwho subscribe to Nebula. Nebula is a place where\nI put all of my videos ad-free and a week early.

And again, a portion of that subscription goes directly to us creators to allow us to continue to do this. I gotta tell you about next week's video. It's about mapping Antarctica and it truly is one of\nthe most ambitious videos I have ever made in my entire career. We tried all this new mapping techniques with this paper globe that is then geo-referenced with Captain Cook's journeys\nthroughout the south. It truly is an amazing piece of work that we have been working\non for a long time. And it's live right now, you can go watch it right now on Nebula. So more than ever, clicking\nthe link in my description that goes to Nebula and signing up really helps to support this channel. I appreciate you all watching. I hope you enjoyed this map video.

    "captions": "So we dropped everything and we're making\na video on the Silicon Valley Bank thing, and I'm reminded of something that's blowing\nmy mind. Watch this. When you put $10,000 into your bank, something\ncrazy happens. The bank loans most of that money out. And eventually that $10,000 turns into $100,000\nin the economy. Economists call this the money multiplier\neffect. And it happens because when you put your money\nin the bank, they only hold on to 10% of it. The other 90% they loan out to someone who\nputs it in their bank, and then that bank loans out 90% of that money and so on and\nso forth. And this just keeps on going. Your money circulates throughout the economy\nbeing stored in banks and loaned out until it's now ten times more money than you originally\nput in. This is the magic of our modern financial\nsystem. But the problem is when everyone wants to\nget their money back at the same time... Video coming soon."

    "captions": "Go ahead and play the lottery, whatever. But just\u00a0\nlet's remember what it is. It's a tax on the poor.\u00a0\u00a0 When you buy a lottery ticket, all of that money\u00a0\ngoes into a big pot. And in my mind it's like, oh,\u00a0\u00a0 it goes into this big pot, and then whoever\u00a0\nwins it gets all that money. That's not how\u00a0\u00a0 it works. Only like 40% of it goes to the\u00a0\nactual, like, winner of the jackpot. A lot\u00a0\u00a0 of the other money goes to the stores that\u00a0\nsell the lottery tickets. The company that,\u00a0\u00a0 like, helps advertise and run the lottery. And of\u00a0\ncourse, a giant chunk goes to Uncle Sam. I mean,\u00a0\u00a0 that's why lotteries exist. That's why\u00a0\ngovernments run the lottery is because\u00a0\u00a0 they need to raise extra money. People don't\u00a0\nlike taxes, so the lottery just makes taxes fun.\u00a0\u00a0 That money usually goes into public programs like\u00a0\nparks and education. Or in the case of Nebraska,\u00a0\u00a0 it goes into like funding their state fair. OK.\u00a0\nThe fact is the lottery is a tax and it is a\u00a0\u00a0 tax that's borne particularly by people who have\u00a0\nless education, who live in poorer neighborhoods,\u00a0\u00a0 and whose money goes into the big lottery\u00a0\njackpot and doesn't actually come back to benefit\u00a0\u00a0 their neighborhood.

These things are usually at a\ngas station or a grocery store and typically you get it from\nlike a guy behind a counter or from one of these cool flashy machines. They cost anywhere from a few\ncents to like a hundred bucks. And as more and more people buy tickets, all of that money goes into\none big pot, the jackpot and it grows and it grows and sometimes can rack\nup to like $2 billion - That much money. - Yesiree. - Third Mega Millions trolling\nto break a billion dollars. - 1.3 billion, 1.9 billion, 2.04 billion. - And even though everyone\nbuying tickets presumably wants to win the jackpot\nat the end of the day after all the ping pong\nballs and the numbers and the weird game show looking thing, only one person actually does - 1.9 billion. - I can't believe it. - And it can be yours for just two bucks. - Meanwhile, everyone else\nis left just a little poorer. - Phoebe, you don't have any\nof the first five numbers. - This is the lottery. It is a government sponsored gambling game that is surprisingly human. Like we've been doing this\nfor thousands of years and we will probably continue\nto do it for thousands more and not just like in the United\nStates, all over the world. And it's almost always the government who's running the lottery. Okay, so like a little\nharmless fun that helps the government make a little extra money. It's not a big deal, right? No, these are not small numbers. This is not a little anything. In 2021, Americans spent\nover 100 billion on lotteries 100 billion, that's with a B. These are giant numbers. This is something we should look into. Okay, so let's dive into this. Why do we do lotteries\nand why is the government running these things and what\ndo they use the money for?

Let's get back to the lottery - Record shattering $1.34 billion ticket. - I can feel the winning ticket. - I'm fairly certain this\nis the winning ticket. - Humans are big on gambling. We've been doing this\nfor thousands of years. - 14,500,000 all in - One of the first versions of\na lottery was over in China. It's rumored that they\nactually used the lottery to fund some of the Great Wall of China. Oh, and after they like chose the numbers the results are said\nto have been delivered by carrier pigeon. The Romans, the Dutch, and\na bunch of other governments over time and throughout\nthe entire world have done lotteries to usually\nfund big projects that the government wanted to do. In England they also loved lotteries and the settlers who wanted to come here to the new world used lotteries to help fund their trip. Eventually the monarch of\nEngland was like, whoa, guys wait a second. Don't use your extra\nmoney to fund lotteries that make you leave us. Use your money over here. Taxes were kind of a\nsensitive topic for England. But anyway, the colonists\nwere like, all right, bet bet, like, bet. You know, like bet like. Bet, bet. (upbeat music) I'm not in touch, I'm not in touch. So they don't do lotteries\nfor like a hundred years. But then eventually they\ntried to do a lottery to like fund their war to against England to become\nlike free from England. So yeah, lotteries are not new. They've been used for a long time and governments have always\nrun them, blah, blah, blah. But in the past few decades lotteries have turned into\nsomething much bigger and more and more they've begun to\ntarget a certain kind of person. Let's, let's go see if\nI can win the lottery. (upbeat music) I just spent two US dollars\non a lottery ticket. Let's see what happens. The jackpot for this\none is 20 million bucks. Seems like a pretty good deal. There's this one lottery\ncalled the Mega Millions. It's where a bunch of states put all of their lotteries together\ninto one giant lottery which means way more people which also means a way higher jackpot which then attracts more people. And then it's just like the greatest thing in\nthe world for the lottery. Okay, wait, but why does the government run a gambling scheme\nthat incentivizes people to like spend their money on gambling? We'll get there in a second, just hold on. But for now, I just need to revel in what is happening\nin my brain right now. This very human feeling\nof buying a $2 ticket. So low risk, I didn't\nhave to pay that much but the potential of $20\nmillion, the Mega Million lottery is making me realize\nwhy gambling is so enticing. And for such a simple little\ngame with Mega Million you choose six numbers. The first one having to\nbe between one and 70 and the last one having\nto be between one and 25. No idea how they calculated\nthose rules, but whatever. Okay, you choose your numbers. You can also just tell\nthem to choose the numbers and an algorithm will do it\nfor you, which is like, listen I already have an algorithm\nsort of running my life most of the time. If I'm gonna gamble, I'm gonna choose the (bleep) numbers myself. I got a little heated there. Anyway, eventually a bunch of balls go into this little spiny thing\nand they choose the numbers and if they choose my\nnumbers, I win $20 million. So at two bucks a ticket,\nwe can infer that probably millions of Americans just did this. They went out and bought a\nticket like this with hopes of changing their lives. Oh, and this isn't just like\nonce a year or something. This is twice a week. They'll hopefully be drawing\nmy numbers tomorrow night and I will be watching. Anyway, let's get back to the explanation. - I got a special\nfeeling tonight Mary Anne - Oh, for me? - No, no no I think I had\nnumbers might come up. - So here in the US you've\ngot a bunch of these big mega multi-state lotteries and\nthey're all run actually by the same non-profit organization. But then you also have these,\nyou've got these little just instant winners like like I could scratch this off right now and see if I win. 10 chances to win. We have to do this right now. Where's a penny? No, seriously, we gotta,\nwe've got to do this. Up to 5,000 bucks. Wait a minute, this has to be a joke. What does that say? - It says $1,000, but I don't know. - There's no way. Oh (bleep) no. - You might have to\nget like three of them. - Yeah. - Oh, reveal a, oh, see I don't know how to gamble. I was like, I just won a thousand dollars. 19, 24. Come on oh man the rush is so real. Womp womp. That's so sad. I was so ready to win today. Okay, sorry, I'm getting out\nof my like intoxicated buzz of gambling, which clearly\nI haven't done enough. I grew up Mormon okay, give me a break. You scratch off this latex you see if you won, you don't win. I didn't win. It's actually really satisfying,\nbut it's kind of messy. You also have smaller\nlotteries that are usually more frequent, but\nthey're smaller jackpots but you have better odds. Anyway the point is there\nare all sorts of lotteries. Speaking of odds, what are my odds of winning the big jackpot? According to one statistician\nwho crunched all the numbers my odds for winning on this ticket is like one in 302 million,\nwhich like, let's be honest no one really knows what that means. I don't know what that means. Like what is that 302 million? That's a bigger number than\nthan my brain can fathom. So let's do a visualization. Imagine you have 66 bathtubs. I mean, I'm not sure why\nyou need 66 bathtubs. It seems a little bit excessive,\nbut who am I to judge? And yes, I know a lot of\nyou noticed I cut my hair. That's because I couldn't handle not shampooing my long hair. Okay, let's just get it out of the way. I know everyone's been thinking it. Anyway, you've got these\n66 bathtubs and each of them is filled to the brim with rice. 4.5 million grains of rice in fact. How did we calculate that number? Go to the sources. We actually did an analysis\nto see how many grains of rice would fit into these bathtubs. 4.5 million. So you've got 66 bathtubs\nand they're all full of rice and one of those grains\nof rice is painted gold. Now close your eyes,\nwalk through the field and thrust your hand into one\nof these 66 bathtubs and pick out a grain of rice and maybe\nyou found the golden grain. But yeah, those are my odds\nof winning tomorrow night. Not as fun to think of it like that. And this works even if you buy a ton of tickets or use the same\nnumbers over and over again. None of this really\ndoes anything meaningful to change your odds. Mr. Beast did this\ngreat video a while back where he bought a million dollars worth of scratch off tickets\nand lost about 300,000. Okay, so we're done with\nthis part of the video. The lottery exists, it's\nbig, you'll probably lose. We all know that. My bigger question here\nis why does the government have a monopoly on this gambling game? - Got a lottery ticket have you? - I just so happened to have one. - No, you can't do that. You have to leave it with me\nand I'll look after it for you. You can come visit us anytime you want to. - Some economists argued that gambling is this natural\nthing that humans love to do. So if they're gonna do it\nanyway, why not use that as a game to generate\nrevenue for the government? But to me that begs the question of like what do they actually use the money for? Luckily there's data for\nthat and for an example let's use this giant lottery\ncalled the Powerball. And let's make the numbers easy here. Let's just say that\neveryone has bought tickets and the big pot has\ntotaled up to $100 million. Which is like, you know actually in the ballpark of\nsomething that could happen. Half of that money goes\nto fund the jackpot. So let's just say that $40 million is for the jackpot and the\nremaining 10 million goes to all the smaller prizes. Okay, but under the hood,\nsomething else is going on. If you look at all the\nbillboards for the Powerball at this moment, it will\nactually advertise it as $67 million for a reason\nthat I will explain in a second. But the point is that only 50% of all the money generated goes to the people who bought the tickets. So the question is, where\ndoes that other 50 million go? Well, 6% of that a hundred million goes to all of the gas stations\nand convenience stores and like other businesses\nwho sell the tickets, they get in on some of this. 9% of the a hundred million dollars, so like 9 million bucks\ngoes to pay all the people and expenses associated with\nlike running the lottery like all the advertising and\nlike the employees and stuff. These are private companies that contract with the government to run\nand advertise the lottery. That leaves us with $35 million of our original a 100 million which according to\nPowerball's website, goes to quote good causes\nsupported by the lotteries. Womp womp. What does that mean? What are good causes? The Powerball website won't tell you much but we did research into this and we found that from state to state the definition of good causes changes. In a lot of states this\nmoney goes to quote education like in Virginia in 2022 where the lottery money was\nused to fund almost $780 million of the public education budget. This is good, leveraging humans obsession with gambling to like fund\nthe education of our children. I'm super into it. Oh, until you realize that\nyes, they give all this money to the education, but then\nthey reduce the existing budget so that it ends up basically\nbeing the same number which means the lottery\ndoesn't actually give any extra money to the education\nsystem, that is so stupid. Oh, and the money isn't even distributed in an equitable way. The funding a lot of time goes towards scholarships, colleges and ends up benefiting wealthier schools. So yeah, that's what\nthey mean by education kind of deceptive, not cool. But then there's other\nplaces where the lottery pays for things that we take for granted that probably\nnever would cross your mind. Like in Colorado where the\nstate spent $14 million on their parks and wildlife in 2019 using profits from the lottery. Or in Nebraska where they\nused the money to fund like their state fair,\nlike who would've guest, oh and this is a good one in\nMinnesota, they've spent over $51 million of lottery\nprofits to fund organizations that help people who are\naddicted to gambling. Like what? Like we're using the\nlottery money to help people not gamble. I don't know that means\nit's just that one's a weird one to me. Okay, so governments\nuse lottery money to do government things, build\ninfrastructure fund public programs and stuff like that, cool. Okay, wait, but why does\nthe government have to collect money in this weird way? We'll get to that I promise, but in a sec. I know everyone's wondering about what happens to the winner. - He's gonna have over $114 million. Wow, how does that sound? - These lucky ducks who just walked into tens of millions of dollars like how much am I gonna\nget tomorrow night when my numbers are picked? It's just sort of manifesting you know in our little scenario, remember that they had advertised\n$67 million and that really it was $40 million that\nwas allocated to the winner. How does that all work out? That is because when you win the jackpot you can get it in two different ways. You can get it all at once or you can get it slowly\nover the course of 29 years. If you get the cash all at once then the government immediately takes out 24% of federal taxes and then of course the state will get their taxes. So like here in DC it's\nlike 9.75% that's taken off. So even though you were\nadvertised 67 million the actual jackpot was the 40 million. So really you walk away\nwith about 26 million bucks. The reason it was advertised as 67 million is because\nof the other option. If you take it slowly over\nthe course of 29 years then the government holds onto that money and invests it in like\nbonds and it gains interest. And they project that over that time it will\nactually be a total payout of $67 million. That also gets taxed a\nbunch of ways and whatever. And eventually you end up with about 43 million\nif you do the over time. So 26 million versus\n$43 million depending on if you take it all at\nonce or take it over time. The point is that once\nagain, even with the winner the government makes a lot\nof money off of lotteries and this is the number that\nshould blow all of our minds. The US federal and local lottery revenue in 2020 was around $27 billion. $27 billion in government\nrevenue because of the lottery. And this is kind of where\nit feels a little messed up because I thought we already had a way of funding the government. Isn't that just called taxes? - Look we got the Powerball\nnumber, we won $3. - Wow, you think we should get that over 20 years ago for the big payout. - Hello America, I'm Tom Crow,\nit is Tuesday, January 17th for tonight's $20 million to win the jackpot you\nmust match these five plus that gold mega ball. Now let's see if I can make\nyou a millionaire tonight. - Nah, I already lost this, (bleep) this. Back to the video. So now we can answer this question. Why does the government\nrun a gambling scheme? And it boils down to this,\nlotteries were illegal in the United States for a very long time. Public opinion was very against them. But then in the sixties,\nNew Hampshire needed money. At the time they didn't have\na sales tax or an income tax. They were running low on tax\nrevenue to fund their schools. So they passed a law that allowed them to start a sweepstakes to raise funds for their schools and it kind of worked. They made money. I mean presumably, right? Like and then other states\nwere like, wait a minute we can make taxes into a fun game and no one will get mad at us? And the answer is, yes you can. It's called the lottery. And so a bunch of other states started to\nadopt it and now we're headed into an era that is characterized\nby lower and lower taxes. - By lowering everyone's\ntax rates all the way up the income scale, each\nof us will have a greater incentive to climb higher to\nexcel to help America grow. - Taxes have never been\npopular, but this was a time when taxes really\nstarted to hit a new low. So after years of being illegal the lottery is back and it\nis back with a vengeance. Soon you have these\nmulti-state national lotteries and the government starts to\nmake millions and then billions of dollars of tax revenue,\nrevenue that they weren't getting from just boring old taxes. Okay, so the lottery is just another tax but who ends up paying\nthese fun voluntary taxes? The people who pay them are the ones who don't really have the means to. Poorer and less educated people are the ones who play the lottery most. - The lottery is mostly a tax\non people who don't know math. - The lottery ends up as a tax on those who can least afford it. - It's a tax on the poor - But most of that money is\nspent by low income consumer. - In South Carolina, one report found that people who make less\nthan $35,000 a year spent more than double on lottery tickets than people who make over $100,000 a year. Let that sink in for a second, double. They also found that\npeople of color are more likely to buy lottery\ntickets than white players. One study found that in almost every state whether it's by design\nor not, neighborhoods that have lottery retailers\nhave a higher poverty rate than neighborhoods that\ndon't have lottery retailers. Remember, this is the free market. These retailers are following the demand. So yeah, you start to see a picture of the government using the desperation of those who are less\neducated to generate revenue that they don't get from\nboring old regular taxes. And then I think the moment\nthat actually gets me here is that that money that revenue goes to fund things\nthat isn't often beneficial to the poorer communities\nthat bought the tickets and paid the taxes. So yeah, that is the lottery. The question is why do we keep doing this? And again, it goes back to that very shrewd economic argument. Humans love gambling,\nthey're gonna do it anyway. Why not just regulate it and make some extra revenue out of it? But as always, there's some\nprivate interests here too keeping this all alive. Who prints all of these, right? Who makes the latex that goes\non the little scratch off? Those are companies that make\na lot of money off the lottery and they actually have lobbyists\nkeeping the lottery alive. So yeah, the lottery exists\nand will probably always exist. I mean, humans love gambling and taxes exist and are necessary. We need to fund our\ngovernment, but do we need to run a gambling scheme\nto raise those taxes? The specific way that the government runs the lottery today is a\nregressive tax on the poor. It raises money and it\nsends that money to places that doesn't benefit the people\nwho are funding that tax. And so when we see that\ngambling funds education or goes to good causes, to me\nthat just feels misleading. We just need to call it what it is. The lottery is a tax on the poor. (slow music) All right, another video is\nin the hopper, the lottery. What is hopper not cool? - Thanks for watching\neveryone, wanna tell you about a few things that I need to tell you about at the end of the video\nthat you may be interested in. Number one, it's no longer just me. I mean it hasn't been for like years but like we now have a large\nteam of people who contribute to making these videos and\nwe have a behind the scenes vlog that we publish once a\nmonth over at the newsroom. The newsroom is just the\nfancy way of saying Patreon but newsroom just sounds way cooler. So we call it the newsroom. Every month we publish a\nbehind the scenes vlog. We have my scripts are over there. You can read the scripts\nand see what those look like if you're interested, you get\na royalty free Tom Fox song and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting this channel and the journalism that\nwe're trying to do. The link is in my description. You can go check that out. Another way to support\nthat might be helpful to you is like we have LUTs and presets. LUTs are how we color our video, without a LUT it looks like this, with a LUT it looks\nlike this, much better. We developed these LUTs with a professional colorist\nand they're really pretty. You can buy those and\nhelp support the channel and also color your photos\nand video much better. You can go watch my next\nvideo, like right now like it's actually live\nover on Nebula because we publish everything a week\nearly on Nebula ad free. So go to Nebula using the\nlink in my description. If you use the link in my description it actually helps support the channel. So like do that. If none of those things are interesting to you and you're still watching this I have to ask you why are\nyou still watching this? Like why are you still\nhere when you could be watching some other cool\nvideo on the internet? Answer in the comments. See you later. That's nice. The interactivity of like, oh\n(bleep) why am I still here? - Cut that, cut that, cut that."

    "captions": "Lately, we've been hearing that\u00a0\nunemployment is at a record low,\u00a0\u00a0 which is a good thing for the economy.\u00a0\nBut I just got done looking deep into\u00a0\u00a0 unemployment for this video we made. And my\u00a0\nbig takeaway is unemployment is actually,\u00a0\u00a0 like, not super well understood. I think\u00a0\nmost people think of unemployment as, like,\u00a0\u00a0 the number of people who don't work. That's like\u00a0\nthe rate that they give, like 3% or whatever. But\u00a0\u00a0 it's actually slightly more nuanced than that.\u00a0\nIt's not everyone in the economy who can't find\u00a0\u00a0 a job. It's actually the number of people who\u00a0\nwant a job, who are like out looking for a job,\u00a0\u00a0 who can't find a job. There are a lot of jobs\u00a0\nin the economy that aren't counted because they\u00a0\u00a0 don't, like, pay money. So like people who care\u00a0\nfor other people, like parents or something, they\u00a0\u00a0 don't count in the unemployment figure. It's only\u00a0\npeople who are out there looking for jobs that\u00a0\u00a0 make money. And what it doesn't capture is people\u00a0\nwho are overqualified for their jobs, like someone\u00a0\u00a0 who studied like to be a pharmacist but can't\u00a0\nfind a job in being a pharmacist, and so they,\u00a0\u00a0 like, teach tennis lessons or something.

Politicians are always talking about it. - Unemployment rate.\n- Unemployment rate. - Unemployment.\n- Unemployment. - Unemployment.\n- Unemployment rate. - Basically whenever we\ntalk about the economy, unemployment is a part\nof the conversation. But it seems kind of simple, right? Like, isn't it just a measure of how many people can't find jobs? So why have I decided to make\nan entire video about it? Well, because behind this definition there is something much bigger going on, something that teaches us about the inner workings of the economy. - Unemployment remains a serious problem. - Unemployment is where\nthe cold rational mechanics of economics meets the\naspirations and disappointments of millions of people. And it shows us how\nour capitalistic system can succeed and fail in allocating the most\nimportant of its resources. It's people. - Unemployment.\n- Unemployment. - Unemployment.\n- The unemployment rate. - Unemployment.\n- It's okay, I got options. Unemployment.\n- Financial crisis. (clock ticking) - Looks good. (Johnny exhaling) Let's go. So we hear this word economy all the time, but what exactly is an economy? Think of the economy as a\nset of rules, relationships, and patterns that help\nhuge groups of people that don't know each other somehow peacefully,\ncoordinate with one another. All of this with the aim of\nallocating scarce resources in an efficient way that, theoretically, should benefit everyone. We all live and participate in an economy that somehow mostly works. Somehow all of us billions of people manage to coordinate with each other, to produce, to innovate, to push the productive\nboundaries of society forward. But none of this complex\ncoordination would be possible without one key ingredient. It's the number that you\nsee everywhere you go. This key ingredient is prices. - Over $7.99.\n- Bigger, bigger. - [Speaker 2] One with $1.99 hamburger. - [Speaker 3] $1.99, 20\nfor $5.99, only at KFC. - Prices are not just prices. Like, it's not just the number to be like, \"That's how much it costs.\" Prices are like telephone\nwires in the economy. They're like the lighthouse\nthat sends out a signal to make the whole thing work. Anyone who didn't study economics is like, \"Wait. It's just prices. Why are you calling it a lighthouse?\" When I was studying econ, this\n\"prices are a signal\" thing was really hard to get my head around. But I now understand that prices are the glue of the economy, the mechanism through which\nthe market organizes itself so that millions of people\ncan make billions of decisions in a harmonious way. To see what I mean, and to figure out what this has to do with unemployment, which is why you clicked on this video, let's go back to the neighborhood that helped us understand\nwhat a recession is in our last econ video that we made. Yes, I make macroeconomic videos now because the people seem to\nlike it, and I seem to like it. So we're all happy. And let's once again focus on baguettes because I like French\nbread, and I lament the fact that my country doesn't have enough of it. - [Nick] I have have a\nbaguette over there too. - Do you? - [Nick] Yeah, I bought\none very coincidentally. - You have a baguette in\nthis studio right now? - [Nick] Yeah, it's in the kitchen. - Not only will you have animation, you'll have a real baguette that I may nibble on\nthroughout this video. (Nick laughing) Okay. Let's go to the neighborhood. Okay, so we're in this neighborhood and baguettes are actually\nbecoming a cool thing. They're trending. Everyone's talking about baguettes. And this one bakery is pumping out delicious artisan baguettes\nfor your neighborhood. These baguettes are like $3 a piece, which is a nice, affordable price. More and more people are\nshowing up to buy them. But the bakery has a problem. They only have capacity to\nmake 20 baguettes per day. But because baguettes are trending, 30 people want to buy\nbaguettes at $3 a piece. So what does the baker do to fix this? \"I know,\" says the baker,\n\"let's raise prices.\" The baker realizes that\nbecause of all this demand, they can raise prices from $3 to $4 and that's exactly what he does. And boom! It just sent out a signal\nto the entire neighborhood. Baguettes are trending\nin the neighborhood. The baker thinks that people\nare willing to pay $4. Of the 30 people who were\nin line to buy the baguettes back when they were $3, 10\nof them shake their head. They're like, \"No way, Jose. $4 is way too spendy for a baguette.\" These 10 neighbors either can't afford or are not willing to pay\nfour bucks for a baguette. But look, 20 of them are\neither fancy rich people or just really love baguettes. And they're willing to stay in that line to pay four bucks for their baguettes. Oh, and look, remember that\nthe baker is only able to make exactly 20 baguettes to meet\nthe 20 baguettes demanded by the people who are willing to pay $4. Prices did that. I mean in reality, the\nbaker didn't raise prices just so that he could\ncreate a nice equilibrium between supply and demand. He did it because he saw an\nopportunity to make more money. But in the process he found a price that matched his 20 baguettes to 20 people who were willing to buy them. Nothing goes to waste. Everyone is happy and the\ninvisible hand has done its work. Thank you, Adam Smith. Now inevitably some\nentrepreneur is gonna show up and be like, \"Oh, there's\na profit making opportunity in this neighborhood.\" They're gonna open a bakery and now the bakery's\nmaking like 50 baguettes and competing with the other bakery. And both these bakeries will eventually have to lower their prices so that more people can\nget in on these baguettes so they can get rid of all their baguettes and baguettes eventually\nwill stabilize to $2.50 or three bucks, and now the\nprices have been stabilized. Thank you competition\nfor keeping prices low. My point in talking over\nsupply and demand here is so that when you see\nthe little price tag on, like, a box of cereal\nin the grocery store, just know that this isn't the company just throwing out a random number. That number in a sense has\nbeen decided for the company by the magic of the\neconomy that pushes prices to be just where they\nneed to be to connect all the stuff available\nto the number of people who are willing to pay for it. There's all sorts of caveats to this. Prices can sometimes create\nreally bad outcomes for people. What I'm trying to convey here is that prices are the\nlanguage that businesses use to communicate with consumers. A signal that conveys information and makes it possible\nfor billions of people to organize and trade with each other. Thank you, prices. Thank you, market. Speaking of prices and markets I'm a small business owner\nand you might be too. And so I'm gonna take a\nmoment to thank our sponsor, which is stamps.com, a company\nI've been using for years to run my small business. For years I would go to the post office, which is something I\nreally don't like to do. It's a very inefficient place. I finally actually was\nwatching an ad like this and clicked the link somewhere and signed up for stamps.com,\nand it changed my world. I'm saying this very authentically. Stamps.com allows you to\nprint your own postage and shipping labels from your office. Oh, but how are we supposed to know how heavy the package is because\nthat affects the postage? Check this out. In our office, we have one. They give you a scale. You have a scale, you measure it, it goes right into your computer and now you're printing\nyour shipping label. And it comes with a discount\non postage from USPS. So it's cheaper and it's very\neasy and quick to set up. There's a reason why\nstamps.com has been around for 25 years helping small businesses solve the pain point of shipping things. There's a link in my description,\nstamps.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel but it also gets you in on\none month of free stamps.com. A trial where you can try this out. You also get free\npostage and a free scale. Like, they'll send you the scale. Again, I got in on this deal from, like, another\nYouTuber a few years ago and I haven't gone back. Thank you stamps.com for\nsponsoring today's video, supporting this channel. Let's get back to unemployment. Market works because of prices. Okay, so what happens when you\napply the same market logic, not just to baguettes and cereal, but to the most important resource of all, the people. In economics, we call the people \"Labor.\" We are all just labor. And instead of prices we call it \"Wages.\" Like, how much you get\npaid for your labor. But the dynamic is really similar. When companies in an economy need workers with certain skills, they\ngoes shopping for labor by posting a job and deciding how much they're willing to pay for\nthat job in the form of wages. Okay, so now we're in a market. And once again, prices or wages\nhelp match up jobs demanded by the job hunters with jobs\nsupplied by the companies looking for labor. If a company has a lot of\nmoney or really needs workers, they can offer a high wage\nlike back in our neighborhood where baguettes are trending and the baker is making great profits and they need help making more baguettes who is willing to pay really well and he quickly attracts people with the right skills\nand the job is filled. Prices or wages have once again served as a great matchmaker in the economy. And thanks to this labor market dynamic, more high-quality\nbaguettes will be produced with the energy and talent\nof different people. The productive frontiers of\nthe economy are pushed forward. People have jobs, the economy is growing. (intense music) Okay, wait, let's just look\nat real life for a second. I love the animated world, it's beautiful. But, like, the labor\nmarket works in real life and it's kind of nuts. Like, have you ever wondered how on Earth you can walk into, like, a pharmacy and there will be people\nbehind the counter who have exactly the special\ntraining needed to be there? Not just in one pharmacy, but in every pharmacy in your city, every pharmacy in the country. All of these people were\nsomehow physically distributed throughout the whole country to meet the demand for pharmacists. In order for these pharmacists to end up at all of these different pharmacies, they had to spend years\nstudying and training. And then they had to take the job and potentially move to a new\nplace to start working there. And no one overtly told them to do this. Like, years ago they decided they wanted to study to be a pharmacist. And then they eventually\ngraduated and they found a job and maybe they had to\nmove across the country. And that's one person's journey. Now times that by every\npharmacist in every pharmacy. And now times that by every\narchitect, and doctor, and engineer, and x-ray technician, and molecular biologists,\nand speech pathologists, and schoolteacher, and police officer. And somehow human beings are being distributed like baguettes. How on Earth does that happen? It's thanks to markets and prices, and that's the moral of the story. Humans are basically like baguettes who get allocated throughout the economy based on price signals\nallowing for a perfect pairing of people and jobs, and not a single person can't find a job. Womp, womp, womp. Not so fast free market. Free market economics does\nmiraculously work quite well to get people paired up with jobs all over this country and world. But no, people are not baguettes. They can't just be\nquickly allocated around based on the economy's needs. Sometimes the market fails us. And when it does, we have unemployment. - You had about 6 million people\nin the country unemployed. Now you have 12 million people\nin the country unemployed. - People are complex. We have different talents,\ndreams, aspirations. And the jobs we take are some of the biggest\ndecisions of our lives. There are way more factors at play than just how much the job pays. The vastness of human experience doesn't always coordinate perfectly with the immediate needs of a market which only cares about\nefficiently allocating a scarce resource. And this gets to one\nreally important version of unemployment. Economists call this\n\"Natural unemployment.\" It's an acknowledgement that\neven in the best of times there will always be certain job seekers who aren't working because\nthey had to go back and get certain training,\nor they have skills that are no longer super\nrelevant to the economy. So they have to pivot. Or in a lot of cases, they aren't willing to\nmove across the country, far away from family, to\ntake a job that pays well but maybe doesn't align with\ntheir values or whatever. Meaning it happens because\nhumans are just being complex humans making important decisions. And the result is that some\nportion of the population will not be able to find a job. Productive resources\nof the economy sit idle and we have unemployment,\nnatural unemployment. Here's what the U.S. natural unemployment over the last 70 years has looked like. Sort of hovers between\nfour to seven percent, which means that at any given point, somewhere between six\nand seven million people want a job but can't find one just 'cause, because the economy is always changing, and the skills that are\nneeded are always changing, and humans are complicated\nand not baguettes, and finding new jobs is a big deal. That's natural unemployment. And it's the one that\nyou never hear about. No one cares about it. It is natural. It is a part of our economy. We kind of forget about it. The type of unemployment\nthat we talk about a lot is the one I'm about to to talk about. But first I have to mention two things that don't get measured in any of this. First is the fact that\nsometimes you have a situation where pharmacists can't find a job because there's no jobs available. All the pharmacies have\nthe pharmacists they need. So now you've got this\npharmacist who's, like, teaching tennis because\nthey can't find a job for what they were trained in. This is called \"Underemployment,\" and it's really hard to measure. And quickly, the other thing is that when we measure\nemployment, all of these graphs, we're only measuring work that\nmakes money for the economy. There are millions of people in the U.S. doing unpaid but\nhighly-economically valuable work, mostly caring for people. I'm talking about parents. So anyway, underemployment\nand not paying caretakers is a whole other topic. And I can make a whole video about that. Let's get to the unemployment\nthat we always hear about. - In the USA, another 2.4 million people have filed for unemployment benefits. In the past week, more\nthan 38 million people have now lost their jobs. - The unemployment that\nnews anchors and politicians freak out about, looks like this. - [Speaker 4] Unemployment\nnumbers are rising. - [Speaker 5] This is the\nworst crisis they've faced. - Shock and panic.\n- These are the worse layoffs the country has seen since\nThe Great Depression. - This is called \"Cyclical unemployment,\" and it's a part of that mysterious pattern that we talked about\nin the recession video where seemingly inevitably\nand unpredictably shocks come blowing through\nour economy every few years, throwing off the nice balance that markets are supposed\nto trend towards. Demand in your industry falls. Your company can no\nlonger afford to pay you. You get fired, you're freaked out, and without a paycheck you're\nnot able to spend money, which means that the other\ncompanies are losing revenue, and they have to lay off their people. And the cycle continues and continues. - [Speaker 6] The housing market collapse created one financial\ncrisis after another. - This cyclical unemployment. This cycle is at the heart\nof why recessions happen. It's like a dangerous avalanche\nof capitalist economies. And because we workers are\ntreated like baguettes, put into a market where\nthere's supply and demand, we get hit by this too. But remember that the\nworst thing that can happen to a baguette is that it\nwill sit unsold and uneaten on the shelf getting stale. I mean, you can make some\ngood croutons out of those. I'm not complaining. But humans aren't baguettes. When humans are an unused\nresource in an economy that means suffering, and\nmisery, and anxiety, and worry. You didn't do anything wrong. You got your training, you got your job, you followed your dreams, the economy even allocated\nyou to a good fit. But now suddenly you are out of work because everyone around\nyou is losing income. The GDP line is going down. And like I explained\nin the recession video, when this line goes down\nin a capitalist economy, bad things happen. (mysterious music) There's a certain paradox to all of this. An economy in a recession is an economy starving of\nnew talent, new output. And yet during these spikes,\nwhen we're in a recession, all of the people that\ncould be contributing to it are sitting idle, unable to find a job in a system that failed them and failed to coordinate\nin the worst way possible. Ultimately, economies exist\nto help people prosper. So when an economy produces\nall of this misery, it's really failing, which\nis why in a lot of countries the government has tools\nto step in and help both to reduce the suffering, but also to ensure that this\ncycle doesn't gain momentum and turn the whole thing\ninto an anxiety-ridden chaos, which whether we want to think\nso or not, is an option here. Economies do collapse\nbecause there is momentum when all of this anxiety starts to spread and people stop spending money and people keep losing their jobs. Governments often have to step\nin and help pump the brakes. So even during the good times the government will step in\nand support unemployed people. And during the bad times, unemployment becomes especially vital for keeping the economy from collapsing. I mean, we saw this during COVID. Unemployment skyrocketed and\nthe government had to scramble to send us all money so\nthat we would keep spending even if we just got fired from our jobs. In Europe, and Japan, and Korea they did it a little bit differently. They actually paid the employers to just not fire people. Either way, the government did this not only to alleviate\nthe immediate suffering of the people who were losing their jobs, but also to avoid the vicious cycle. - [Speaker 7] Unveiled a\nnearly $2 trillion COVID-19 relief plan on Thursday,\nurging lawmakers to act fast and jumpstart an economy\npummeled by the pandemic. - The upshot here is that unemployment is both complicated and\nincredibly high stakes. It's unpredictable. We can't really stop it. Or at least we haven't\nfigured out how to yet. Not only because it deals\nwith complicated human lives that have a capacity for suffering, but also because at the end of the day we humans aren't just\nparticipants in the economy. We are the economy in a very real sense. Our mass psychology dictates\nhow this all plays out. And because we are all\ntied into this together, no single one of us has total control over our own situation, which is an incredibly\nscary thing to think about. So don't think about it too much. It's a sort of Faustian\nbargain that we've made. And for most of us, it's worth it. Incredible opportunity for prosperity in exchange for surrendering\nsome control of our situation. So we do this as one\ngiant connected group, working hard to coordinate with each other using the language of prices and wages with the hope of procuring\nand providing resources for ourselves and our family. And this is why politicians and the news talk about unemployment all the time. It's because our jobs are not baguettes. Our work is a huge part of our lives, and yet they are not guaranteed. So supporting jobs, job\nsecurity, job wellbeing, and solid employment truly is one of the most important things a government can and\nshould do for its people. (clock ticking)\nOkay, done. - [Nick] Sweet. - I'm just going to, I'm just gonna be a\nchaotic man for a second. (Johnny exclaiming) Okay, so. Whoa, hi. (Johnny exhaling) Unemployment. Hope you understand more about that topic. (bread crunching) Moral of the story is that\nhumans aren't baguettes. That's all I was trying to say, okay? It doesn't mean baguettes aren't special. Hold on, let me finish\neating this baguette. I hope everyone's liking these\nmacroeconomics explainers. There's so many topics here\nthat are kind of gate kept by economists who like to\nmake them really complicated. They're not that complicated. Like, we can all understand\nwhat this stuff is. And yeah, I just like the idea of having like a whole library\nof macroeconomic concepts that we can explain. Anyway, thanks for watching today's video. And thanks to the supporters\nover at The Newsroom, which is our Patreon\nwho support our videos, support our studio, support all the people behind the scenes. We make an extra video for our\npatrons every single month. And it's a behind the scenes vlog of how we do what we do here on this YouTube channel that has now grown into dozens of people who\nhelp make it possible. That's why we're able\nto publish every week. Not because of me, I'm one part of it. But we have a really cool, talented team of people who help make this possible. So that's The Newsroom. We also sell LUTs and presets, which help you color\nyour videos and photos. I published my videos a\nweek early over on Nebula. You can see the link in\nmy description for that. And lastly, if there is\nan economic principle, or idea, or thing that\nyou hear a lot about and want me to explain and\nunpack, just let me know. I am more than happy to keep this up. Thank you all for being here. Thanks for watching here until\nthe very end of this video. Like, we're in the last moments here and you are still watching,\nwhich I really appreciate. So I guess we'll see\nyou with the next one, which is probably gonna be soon. Or if you go to Nebula you could watch it literally right now. But see you. (ethereal music) Okay, we're done here."

    "captions": "Today, I learned that vitamins were discovered\u00a0\nby the butter industry. It's like 1913,\u00a0\u00a0 and the margarine industry is threatening to\u00a0\ncompete with butter. Margarine being a fat\u00a0\u00a0 substitute that's not made from dairy. Anyway. So\u00a0\nthese massive dairy industries like in Wisconsin,\u00a0\u00a0 are like, \u201cNo way, Jose. Butter is better\u00a0\nthan margarine. We got to prove it.\u201d So\u00a0\u00a0 they do what corporations have always done\u00a0\nand continue to do, which is hire scientists\u00a0\u00a0 to prove that their product is actually really\u00a0\ngood. And soon they're showing that the rats\u00a0\u00a0 that ate butter were like better than the\u00a0\nones that ate margarine And they were like,\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, this is like a good marketing thing. But\u00a0\nlike, why are the butter-fed rats fatter and\u00a0\u00a0 happier and healthier?\u201d And in doing all their\u00a0\nexperiments, they isolated this micronutrient,\u00a0\u00a0 this molecule that our bodies need. They called it\u00a0\na vitamin. And because the one that they found in\u00a0\u00a0 butter was like the first one they discovered,\u00a0\nthey're like, \u201cwhat should we call it?\u201d \u201cA,\u00a0\u00a0 like first letter of the alphabet, Vitamin A.\u201d\u00a0\nThat's how we got vitamin A. Since then, we've\u00a0\u00a0 discovered 13 essential vitamins. So you can thank\u00a0\nbutter for vitamins. Thank you, butter. Love you."

    "captions": "- I like milk for all the good, healthy things that are in it. - [Narrator] Mankind's\nmost nearly perfect food. - Good, fresh, healthy milk. - The year is 1981. Raiders of the Lost Ark\nis the number one movie, and everyone is wearing leg warmers. You've got this former\nactor turned politician who's now the president, and he loves free markets\nand he has a big problem. It wasn't the national debt or some big foreign policy issue, though he had plenty of those. His problem was too much cheese. The government was sitting\non this giant stockpile of processed cheese that\nwas in some cave in Kansas, hundreds of millions of pounds, and it was starting to turn kind of gross. - [John] We've got 60 million of these we can't find a market for. - There was so much cheese\nthat one official said that the best thing to do would be to \"dump it in the ocean.\" So Reagan decides to give it away for free to America's poor. The cheese was to come out of the caves and into the American welfare system. - [Narrator] The great cheese giveaway began today in California. Needy people lined up to\nget the surplus cheese. - As the cheese flowed to the underserved, it became a symbol of\nthe welfare experience. And soon, government cheese\nwas cropping up in movies and hiphop lyrics by artists\nwho grew up on the stuff. \u266a After that government cheese \u266a \u266a We eating steak like powdered\nmilk and government cheese \u266a \u266a In the mornin' with some \u266a \u266a Government cheese (government cheese) \u266a \u266a What else is a thug to do \u266a \u266a When you eatin' cheese\nfrom the government \u266a By the way, I'm not allowed to actually play much of those songs because there's like a\ncopyright infringement. If I do, and even though it's fair use, they probably will flag me and I won't make any money off this video. So we left a giant playlist of all the government\ncheese songs in the sources. Dory. Okay, but how did we end up with a surplus of literal caves full of\nhighly processed cheese in the first place? And while we're at it, why did I drink so much milk as a kid? Like why were there like five of these in my refrigerator at all times? My mom would give me a big\nglass of milk in the morning, and then I would go to\nschool and be served a carton of this stuff while also reading the bestselling kids novel at the time, which was about a girl's\nface on a milk carton. And then I would get home, and my mom would give\nme more milk for dinner. And along with this milk,\nI was served a message, a message about calcium, about how milk was vital for strong bones. - [Advertiser 1] Milk, the\nbest bone-building foods for all ages. - [Advertiser 2] Bone-building calcium- - [Advertiser 3] That makes a quart a day. - I always drink plenty of milk. - Turns out that my\nmom and school did this because they were lied\nto for a very long time. And that's what this video's about. The story of milk in this country shows us how far the government will go to protect certain industries, even at the expense of telling Americans the truth about what they're eating. It's a lie that gave us\nbillboards of Austin Powers and stone cold Steve Austin\nwith crusty milk mustaches. So let me show you how\nwe, at least in America, got brainwashed by milk. - It's the only milk I drink. - [Narrator] An important food\nfor the health of the nation. - I'll take a milk. - Okay, so before we get into this baby, I need to thank today's sponsor, which is one I actually use and I'm excited about, CoPilot. CoPilot's a platform that is designed to make you more consistent\nwith your workout. There's so much focus\non fitness being about like getting strong and\nbeing faster or whatever. For me, it's just like I just need to move my body every day so I'm not sad. It's an app that goes on your phone and your watch if you want, and it pairs you up with a\ncoach that you actually speak to and you tell them what you want to do, how rigorous you want to be, what kinds of things you wanna work on, whether or not you have\naccess to weights or a gym. So I met with a coach, Devin. We had this conversation\nabout what I wanna work on, and then he loaded up like a personalized training plan for me that I\ncould start using the next day. It's like frictionless. Like the technology user\nexperience is really nice. Like you just go through\nevery one of your workouts. There's a visual for\nevery single one of 'em, and then at the end of your workout, you can give feedback to your trainer. This human element of having\na person that is there and that you're accountable to that's gonna check in with\nyou changes everything. It actually makes you feel like, oh, there's someone who cares about this. For accountability, that is\nreally, really important. So I love the human element. It's not just like an automated robot. It's actually like a real person who's coaching you and guiding you. CoPilot found that their\nclients are nine times more likely to stick with their goals because of the way this platform works. And I'm not surprised. It's literally meant for accountability and facilitating a frictionless experience with moving your body. It's not about getting buff, it's about just being consistent, though you can get buff\ntoo in the process. There's a link in my description. It is go.mycopilot.com/johnnyharris. If you click that link,\nyou get a free trial with your own expert\nfitness and health coach. You can see if it works in\nhelping you move your body. And if you're anything like me, that is vital for happy life. Thank you, CoPilot, for\nsupporting this video. Let's dive in to milk. I'm not anti-milk. I love milk. Milk, in fact, is pretty magical. Think about it. Milk is the first thing that\nwe drink when we're born. It literally keeps us alive. And if you wanna talk about evolution and human civilization, like\nmilk was a huge part of this. We started domesticating\nanimals and realized that the fatty nutritious\nmilk meant for this baby could also be used for these babies. But human bodies weren't able to digest milk after childhood. They didn't have the enzymes to do so, especially another animal's milk. But the beautiful thing about human bodies is they can change. Over time, milk became a\nkey source of sustenance for people living in\ncertain parts of the world, like northern Europe. They relied on their animals\nduring cold, harsh winters. They couldn't grow crops. Same with the nomadic\npeople in like the Sahara who relied on milk during hot summers. And doing this for a few thousand years, their genes actually changed. Suddenly, they had enzymes that could help break\ndown and digest milk. Like they forced evolution to\nmake them tolerant for milk. Good for them. And that is why this map exists. There's some weakness to the methodology on how this map was made, but\nit captures a true point here, which is that everyone around the world digests milk differently. Like the bluer your\ncountry is in this map, the more people can digest milk. So yeah, you've got northern Europe with like 80 or 90% of the population being able to digest lactose. And because of those nomadic tribes that got used to drinking milk, that's why Niger is blue here. Meanwhile, in places like Asia, most buddies drink milk and are like, \"Dude, WTF. Why you putting baby\nfood in my adult body? We don't digest this after the age of six. Get it out of here.\" Humans would find a way around this by taking the digestive enzyme from a cow's belly called rennet and mixing it with milk. This would start the\nbreaking down of the milk. And then they could put it\nin caves and let it ferment. And soon, you're storing your milk and you're also making\nit kind of delicious. This is the birth of stuff\nlike cheese and yogurt. We also turned milk\ninto things like butter, which would last longer and is undeniably one of the most delicious things that had ever been invented by humans. But raw milk, the stuff\nright out of the cow's utter wasn't consumed by\nanyone besides like kids. And frankly, that wasn't\nthe safest thing to do, because milk goes bad really quickly. When it sits around, it becomes a cozy feeding ground for microorganisms, which again was great for making cheese, but kids drinking this\nstuff was kind of risky. That all changed when this guy\nfound a way to heat up milk and kill off all the dangerous pathogens. It made it way safer and way easier to extend the shelf life. He called it pasteurization, which was named after the guy's last name. Like am I the only one who\nthought the pasteurization came from like the cow's pasture, but it was actually just\na French guy's last name? No, no one else thought that. I'm literally the only one who, okay, cool. So despite all of these problems, milk ekes by from being canceled\nthanks to pasteurization. And now, kids can keep drinking it. Okay, the evolution and digestion part of this video is now over. Let's get to the economics\nand the government policy, and now it's the United\nStates in the 1900s, and technology has given\nhumans new food options, like margarine, which threatened\nto compete with butter. Dairy companies realized that they needed to defend their product. They needed to prove\nthat butter was better. So they start doing science. This is the era of dairy science. It gets pretty juicy. Like this study that shows that when they gave dairy to rats, they actually grew stronger and larger. And it must be because of a\nvitamin inside of the milk. A new concept. Let's call it vitamin A. A because it's the first\nvitamin we discovered. So yes, this is where vitamins came from. Like we didn't have vitamins before 1912. And so now, dairy companies are loving it. They have a scientific paper that says that milk corrects dietary\ndeficiencies and quote, and this is a little aggressive, \"is the greatest factor for\nthe protection of mankind.\" That doesn't sound sensational\nor biased in any way. It sounds very scientific. The greatest factor for\nthe protection of mankind. Dairy companies aren't\ngonna be asleep at the wheel while other forms of nutrition\nand fat try to displace them. So they form a cooperation, a council, the National Dairy Council\nthat promotes all things dairy. And they start to build a strong message to the American people that\ndairy isn't just a nice-to-have. It is scientifically proven\nto be vital for your health. But like let's keep some perspective here. Animal milk went from being something that humans couldn't have\nbeyond the age of six to something that some\nof us developed a gene to be able to digest, to then something that was\nlike a hotbed for pathogens. And we solved that with pasteurization. But now, in the early\n1900s in the United States, milk was a magical, perfect white drink that could cure all things. All of this was happening\nright in time for a moment that would change everything, both for the world but also\nfor milk's place in it. - [Narrator] It is not an\narmy we must shape for war. It is a nation. - During World War I, the\nsoldiers were struggling. They were sick, they were malnourished, but lucky for them, the\nUnited States was ready with a perfect product\nto improve their health. - [Narrator] Milk, we need more milk. Never enough milk to go around. - We were now able to condense\nmilk into a powder form. Now it could last for years on a shelf without refrigeration. This really helped milk level up. Now, the magic drink was a magic powder that could help our men in\nuniform fight the bad guys. Milk was now associated with patriotism and freedom and liberty and America. Man, if you want a way\nto like make your product popular and famous, just\ntie it with like America. So now, with their big new customer, the United States government, farmers fully shifted\ntheir businesses to dairy. They needed to meet this demand. But the war ended. The men in uniform came\nhome and these farmers were left with a massive\noversupply of dairy. The government doesn't wanna hurt the big patriotic dairy industry. So instead of telling dairy\nfarmers to like go back to producing less, they\nconvinced people to drink more. - [Narrator] Rich in all\nthe protein, minerals, and B vitamins of whole milk. - And here's where we really start to see this vital web of relationships\nbetween dairy farmers, the United States government via the Department of Agriculture, scientists, and advertisers. It is a web of relationship that cements milk's place in our culture. It is the reason why in the '90s, I was drinking like\nfive cups of milk a day. Milk becomes an advertiser's dream, a magic white liquid that\nis scientifically proven to be the key to our children's\nhealth and development. And this message had a very strong ally at the US Department of Agriculture who teams up with the dairy industry. So it's like after World War I and the USDA gets involved\nwith these campaigns. The reason I wanna show you this stuff from like the '20s isn't because I wanna give you a history lesson. It's because I wanna show you how the US Department\nof Agriculture behaved, how it supported the dairy industry, how it kind of pushed a lot of propaganda, because when you see it here\nin the '20s 100 years ago, you'll see the version of today, which I'll show you in a moment, and you'll see those connections. And you'll be like, wow,\nnot much has changed. And it will kind of blow your mind. A little foreshadow. Anyway, look at this thing. So we have this Education\nMilk for Health campaign. This is effectively the\ngovernment telling the people what they deem as the\nhealthy thing for everyone. There were milk songs\nand plays and posters and this terrifying clown that told you to brush your teeth and drink your milk. By 1937, kids are supposed to be drinking one quart of milk a day. Luckily, from the video I\nmade about the metric system, we've got measuring vessels around here. Okay, it is 1937 and the US government wants our children to drink how much milk? Oh, my God, no. I have children. And if I ever gave them this much milk, I'll feel like a criminal. And here's the USDA doing studies to scientifically prove\nthat this is legit. It's not just advertisers. Look, the government is doing studies and publishing things, and\nnow they are weighing children and measuring them to show that after this big milk campaign, the kids are taller and way more. And here they are with a bottle of milk and two graham crackers for lunch. Like it truly is becoming\nthe substance for children. And I mean, look at this, the smoking gun proof of it all, one of these rats had\nmilk and the other didn't. These rats are the same age, and each of them have the\nsame feet except for milk. Milk builds a strong and healthy body. Okay, but this isn't just advertising, this is like real science, right? It's like South Dakota State College, which is a real college, and the US Department of\nAgriculture cooperating. Two authoritative institutions, right? Well, like any science that is being done, you have to look at the interests here. It turns out that the\npeople doing this science at South Dakota State College were receiving a bunch of money\nfrom the state legislature because South Dakota is\na big dairy industry. So they fund this dairy\nscience program, and suddenly, all of these really positive\ndairy studies are coming out that, again, the USDA who wants to protect its rural farmers is\nhelping support as well. Positive science means more dairy sales, which means supporting\nlocal rural economies, which means supporting America, which is so depressing to me. Yeah, I know this was\nlike in the '20s and '30s. but like this same thing happens today. Science that is funded\nby certain industries with a certain agenda, and it just sort of muddies everything. Okay, but what about the economy? What happens when the\ngreat depression comes, and now, Americans can't\nreally afford milk? Usually, this would hit the dairy industry and they would have to scale down, because now, the demand\nfor milk is way lower. But farmers weren't gonna let this happen. They were becoming like royalty. And so they respond by going on strike, dumping a bunch of milk into the streets to artificially limit supply\nand drive the price back up. And to be like, \"FU\ngovernment, where are you at?\" So to fix this, milk's new loyal ally, the US government steps\nin and passes a law that says that if the\nprice of milk dips below the cost that it takes to produce it, instead of market economics, where the dairy farmers\nwould just make less of it, the government would step in\nand cover the cost difference. Let them keep making their milk. And now the government is really messing with the invisible hand, the market that helps supply and demand link up with each other\nat the right price. Once you start doing that,\nit's really hard to go back. So then add in another World War, where even more farmers got\ninto the milk game for HIM. And by the '50s, milk is\ncemented into the American psyche through years of creative storytelling, shaky scientific messaging,\nwar, and a government who is more and more\ninfluenced by dairy farmers. The pattern repeats itself in the '70s. The economy is tanking, dairy\nfarmers are struggling again, and who's here to save them? Jimmy Carter. \u266a There's a dream of a\ncountry wide and bountiful \u266a Jimmy did what American\nleaders before him did. He bowed down before\nthe massive dairy lobby and bailed out farmers once again. - I am in favor of giving\nfarmers an equal break. - This time in the form of $2 billion going into the dairy industry\nto guarantee them high prices, and crucially for our story, to buy the extra milk that nobody wanted. Suddenly, farmers who were\nbroke had loads of cash, and they were incentivized to produce as much milk as possible because they knew the government\nwould buy it from them. Okay, but wait, what is the government doing with all this milk? Milk spoils really fast. \"Okay,\" says Jimmy Carter and company, \"Instead of buying the milk itself, let's also buy a bunch\nof stuff that uses milk. Stuff that could be stored\nand forgotten about, like butter and powder and cheese.\" So the dairy farmers kept\nproducing tons of milk and cheese, and the government, at one point, was buying a quarter of all\ncheddar cheese in America. But unsurprisingly, when your big customer is the US government who\nis buying your cheese, 'cause America, you're not gonna actually\nmake a great product. One woman who grew up on\nthis stuff wrote about it in an essay and described it\nas like \"poor man's Velveeta.\" - Government cheese make\nthe best grilled cheese you'd have never had in your life. - And this is really sad to me 'cause dairy can be really cool. Like I see France with\na tradition of like Brie and like camembert and\nlike Holland has gouda, and we, we've got this, American cheese, pasteurized processed cheese, which is kind of more like\na cheese-like substance and isn't a product of like culture and like refining a craft. It's a product of modern\nindustrial policies meant to protect farmers. And it's what helped the\nUnited States cement its place as the home of some of the\nworst cheese in the world. - Where do you buy government cheese? - You got to be on a special mailing list. - Government cheese is also\nthe special ingredient. - So this is how we ended up with a surplus of horrible cheese sitting in limestone caves in Kansas. By the '70s, there was 200 million pounds of extra cheese and other\ndairy products sitting here. And this is why the government\nstarted giving it away to food banks and to America's poor, the underserved that wouldn't be buying this cheese in the first place, so they weren't throwing off the other customers and\ndriving the price down. That's partly because Americans on welfare were disproportionately\nnon-white, African, Asian, or Native American descendants. Meaning, they're way more\nlikely to be lactose intolerant. See the section above about evolution in the milk chain and stuff. This cheese also flowed\nto schools and prisons. And now, we're in the '90s, my childhood, where I'm drinking a\nlot of milk every day. And this is where the whole government advertising science thing gets\na lot worse, in my opinion. - My mom just always instilled\nin me, drink your milk. - Drinking milk is awesome as having three glasses of milk a day helped us to really stay lean and fit. - The thing about the\ngovernment getting involved in setting the prices for\nstuff is that once you start, it's really hard to go back. For some markets, that's okay, like insurance and electricity, utilities, the government should be involved. But milk, like it's just a thing that people can choose to buy or not. Like it should be left\nto the invisible hand to decide how much people actually want, how much they're willing to pay, and therefore, how much\nfirms should produce. But instead, the US government had created a totally distorted market\nwith a bunch of fake demand. And in the process, incentivizing farmers to make tons of milk that nobody wanted. And the problem is with these policies is the surplus was just\ngetting bigger and bigger. At one point, the government\nliterally had to start paying dairy farmers\nto stop producing milk, to slaughter their herds. But even that wasn't working. So what's the next solution? Well, they tried what\nthey did in the '20s. Instead of getting the\nfarmers to produce less, let's convince the people to drink more. So we pass a law that\nallows all the dairy farmers to pitch into this big\nfund that they can use for advertising and research, which are kind of becoming the same thing. And the USDA, the Department\nof Agriculture becomes like the referee, to make sure that like they're not like doing\nany false advertising. And this is where we\nget campaigns like this. - [Narrator] Milk, it does a body good. - And. \u266a America's favorite health kick (milk) \u266a And in the '90s, the\nunforgettable Got Milk campaign. - [Speaker] Who shot Alexander Hamilton? (telephone ringing) (speaking indistinctly) - [Speaker] Got milk? - The people who coordinated\nthis were freaking brilliant. (upbeat music) They turned Got Milk\ninto like a cool thing that every celebrity\nwanted to be a part of, to the point where they're taking like way cheaper rates for these campaigns just because it was like\nthe cool thing to do. This is how you get this huge variety of different celebrities all appearing in magazines\nand ads for milk. Not a particular brand of milk, just milk. - Well, Mr. Miller told\nme he never drinks milk. (screaming) - And these cool celebrities are telling us a story that\nmilk builds strong bones. It has calcium and other\nessential nutrients, and that it even helps you lose weight. - [Speaker] Milk your diet, lose weight. - Meanwhile, they're\nfunding all of these studies that are validating their claims, and the USDA's standing by\njust letting it all happen. So this is why in the '90s, my mom had like a bunch of\nthese in her refrigerator. And I can't blame her. Like what are you gonna do? The government authority on nutrition is telling you that you\nshould be drinking milk. You've seen in all these\nbillboards and magazines. You have real studies talking\nabout calcium and bone health. This really embedded itself. But if there's anything we've learned is that no matter how much\nthese forces push milk on us, people don't actually wanna\ndrink as much milk anymore. Milk demand, even during\nthe Got Milk years, started going down, but the\ndairy lobby wasn't gonna let up. They weren't gonna take\nthe hint from the market. So they started finding other ways to get us to drink milk. Instead of drinking it, we could eat it. (upbeat music) - [Speaker] Rush first. - So the modern version of this is the dairy lobby looking\nat fast food restaurants, partnering with them to give\nus all kinds of cheesy things. You can't see it, but in all\nof these cheesy advertisements, the dairy lobby is there,\nlobbying and pushing to get more and more\ncheese in these products. The dairy industry literally has its own like marketing agency\ncalled Dairy Management, whose goal it is to make this happen. They partner with fast food chains, and they give us stuff like\nPizza Hut's Three Cheese Stuffed Crust Pizza and the\nSummer of Cheese campaign, or personal favorite, Taco\nBell's Steak Quesadilla that has cheddar pepperjack mozzarella and cheese sauce that\nincreased dairy sales by 4%. This one product. That's because it uses\neight times more cheese than any other product on the menu. Eight times more cheese. - [Narrator] A tasty triumph\nof culinary engineering. Bite into the new Steak Quesadilla today. - Or Domino's, who has a cheese pizza that has 40% more cheese on it. It generates 177 million of sales. And the input for all this cheese, a billion additional pounds of milk. But of course, we gotta hit the schools. The schools are a fantastic\nplace to sell dairy to. So Domino's now gets pizza\ninto 2,000 schools nationwide. And we've got emails. Here's an email between Pizza\nHut and the dairy lobby's marketing agency and they're talking about how to sell more pizza and more cheese. I mean, it's brilliant if\nyou're a marketing person, which is these people are advertisers. They're like, \"People aren't\ndrinking milk as much. Let's just pile it onto\nfreaking stuffed crust and cheese pizzas around America.\" Oh, and by the way, these\npeople sign their names as Lord of Cheese and Lady of Cheese. These people are serious about dairy. The point I'm making here is, these people aren't nutritionists. Like they're not concerned with anything other than selling more dairy. Like the former CEO of this\ndairy marketing company is like, \"If every pizza included\none more ounce of cheese, we would sell an additional 250 million pounds of cheese annually.\" Just one more pound\ndown Americans' throats. I mean, again, I don't blame these people. They're freaking advertisers. They literally only care\nabout selling stuff. What concerns me is\nthat they're doing this with the blessing of a government\nagency who I pay taxes to. It is a powerful all seen health agency that dictates our nutritional guidelines, and yet they stand by and\nsupport these campaigns for all of these products that have such excessive amounts of dairy in them. Wait, so why does this happen? Why is the USDA like on\nthe side of dairy farmers? On their website, it says that\ntheir job is to promote stuff that will \"better nourish Americans.\" They put out things like the food pyramid, and they're supposed to be a source of objective information\nabout what we should eat. But wait, look at this. In the same page, on their mission, they also say that they're supposed to \"help rural America thrive and to promote agricultural production.\" Help Americans know how\nto nourish themselves and promote rural America. Which one of those things\nis more important to them? I mean, the answer to that is clear. Look at the nutritional guidelines that they put out to be like,\n\"Here's what you should eat.\" And look at who advises them on this. Yeah, there's like some like experts and doctors from universities, but there's also like executives\nfrom companies like Dannon, a yogurt company, and a\nbunch of other dairy people who have no other interest\nthan making money. And yet they're like in the same room as the people who are deciding\nwhat Americans should eat. Like no, that's not how it works. Dairy has been shoehorned\ninto so much of the messaging from our government to us\nover the years that, again, of course my mom's gonna be like, \"Yeah, you gotta drink milk. The government is telling\nus that this is good.\" (upbeat music) So yeah, the dairy industry is so deeply embedded in\nour federal government, it's really hard to turn it back. This unnatural false demand\nthat we have in our country for dairy is really hard to like rewind. And the amount of money that flows to influential lawmakers to\nkeep this whole thing going, you can't really cut it off. But some of you were thinking like, we're not talking about cigarettes. Like this is milk. It's not a bad thing. Like calcium is good\nfor your bones, right? No. I mean, yes, but no. Yes, calcium's good for your bones. Milk has things that help you, but like you can get all of\nthat stuff from other places. There's nothing special\nabout this white substance unless you're like a\nfarmer in Sweden in 1532, and it's winter and you can't have crops. Like with less than a cup of almonds, you get that much calcium. Dried figs, some cooked kale, even tofu, which comes from soybeans. You can get this stuff from\na bunch of different foods. And a reminder that five billion people, more than half the world don't drink milk. Like they're fine. And there are even studies\nnow showing that too much milk can actually be bad for your bones. So no, despite all the\nindustry-funded studies that tell us that milk\nis the magical elixir and all of the creative storytelling that's embedded in our psyche, this is not some magic substance. This is a thing that was\nmeant for cow babies. But the fact remains that I\nstill consume a lot of dairy. That's because milk is a\nmagical, beautiful thing. It's delicious. It has a deep history for so\nmany cultures around the world. And even here in the United States, there are a bunch of dairy\nfarmers who are small, respectable family-owned\nfarms who have been doing this for a really long time,\nmaking really amazing products that go to actually meet a real demand for people who actually want to eat delicious cheese or milk or whatever. I'm not saying let's get rid of it. Dairy is freaking delicious. But the dairy industry we\nhave does not celebrate that, does not create a market\naround beautiful products and things that people want. It is a fake market that\nhas been pushed to us through real lies, through this\nidea that milk is essential with things that you\ncan't get anywhere else. A century of the most clever marketing. (upbeat music) - [Child] Milk, it does a body good. - I guess what I feel here is like a little bit disillusioned that the government agencies\nthat we pay our taxes to to give us objective advice and guidance can sometimes lead us astray, be so deeply under the\ninfluences of corporations and old legacy industries in our country that they end up protecting\nthem more than they protect us. That is disappointing to me. (upbeat music) Thanks for watching. Thanks again to CoPilot\nfor sponsoring the video. That link in the description\nhelps support this channel and also gives you a free trial with your own expert\nfitness and health coach. And thank you all for\nwatching a video about milk.

This list is a list of foreign agents, people who are either\nreceiving funding from, or influence from foreign entities. They're now branded as\nforeign agents within Russia. They're required to put\nthat they're foreign agents on their tweets and on\ntheir YouTube videos. Everyone knows that\nthey're a foreign agent. But really, what foreign agent means is Putin doesn't like what they say. - [Tamara] The critical piece here is that you are subject to fines and potentially a criminal\ninvestigation for non-compliance. So if you're on this list\nand you don't start putting a little disclaimer, if they choose to prosecute, they have grounds to do so, and that's the scary part. - I've been talking to our story producer who is a Russian journalist who is helping connect us to\nwhat's going on, on the ground. So of the people we've talked\nto who's on this list now? - [Tamara] They're all on it now. Everyone. - They're they're all on it? - [Tamara] Irina was the only\none who was off of it before.

The list is huge and it\nis growing every day. This is getting bad. This is getting really, really bad. In this story, I want\nto show you what life in Putin's Russia is like today. Not fed through my Western\nlens or through Western media, but rather through the lens of the people who are living there. I reached out to all of you\nlooking for people in Russia to tell me what it is like\nright now to be in this country. And what I'm seeing through all of this is a place that is\nincreasingly turning back to the old Soviet days. And in the process, cutting off one of the most\nimportant parts of any society. It's flow of information. (intense music) - [Micheal] Everything\nchanged when the war started. (Putin speaking Russian) (intense music) - Real quick, before we dive\nfully into today's video, I want to thank today's sponsor who is a longtime\nsupporter of this channel. Thank you Better Help for\nsponsoring today's video. I've said it once and I\nwill continue to say it. I am a super, giant, massive\nbeliever and fan of therapy. Therapy has changed my life.

And Better Help is a platform that is making therapy\nmore accessible to people. Normally with therapy, you call around to different offices and you see if it works\nwith your insurance and you do all this stuff and it's complicated\nand hard and difficult.

Let's dive into this story about Russia and Russian YouTubers and\ninformation in Russia. It is a fascinating one. Let's go. (intense music) We got tons and tons of\ncommunity submissions for this piece, like\nhours and hours worth. - Hi, Johnny. - [Blurred Speaker] Hi.\n- [Blurred Speaker 2] Hello. - [Blurred Speaker 3] Hello.\n- Hi. - Hello, Johnny. - [Blurred Speaker 4] Hi Johnny. - Hi Johnny.\n- Hello. - Hi. - [Blurred Speaker 5] Hello, I'm Russian. - I'm from Russia. - Hi, I'm a student from Moscow, Russia. - So let me get you up to\nspeed on what's going on here. How we got to a Russia\nthat looks like this, and of course it has to do with this guy. (intense music) It's easy to think that Vladimir Putin is just this big bad dictator who's existed forever ruling Russia. But no. Vladimir Putin was elected to become the president of Russia in 2000. Back then, Russia was a\npretty different place than it is today. He's served two, four-year\nterms and by 2008, Putin's time was up. The constitution of Russia\nexpressly prohibits anyone from being able to be president\nfor more than two terms, like here in the United States. But Putin wasn't ready\nto give up on power, so he found a little loophole. The Constitution doesn't say anything about someone taking a break\nafter their second term and then coming back and\nbeing president again. So Putin pulled this move. He got this guy to become\npresident for four years while he, Putin, became\nthe Prime Minister. And this was a good time\nfor the Russian economy, which was opening up to foreign investment and the economy was growing nicely. This new president of Russia\nsat with President Obama and had like a burger and\nfries here in Washington DC, in an effort to reset relations\nbetween the two countries. But while Putin was taking\nthis little four year break, he was not loving all of this. As the 2012 election approached, he needed to get back into the top job. So he convinced this\npresident not to run again and instead, to back\nPutin's presidential bid. In exchange, they would\njust sort of switch places and this guy would become\nthe prime minister. And that's exactly how it worked. Putin won the 2012 election and these two just switched places. Some people have called\nthis, like, castling, like in chess. It's the only time in the game where you're allowed to\nmove two pieces at once, and it's a move that's\nmeant to protect the king. So it's 2012 and a bunch\nof people in Russia are onto what Putin's up to. They take to the street in protest of what was clearly one man\naccumulating ultimate power in their country. All in an election that\noutside observers concluded was not fully free and fair. But none of this mattered, because by 2012, Putin is back in power. And he's not gonna play nice anymore. He cracks down on these protests, and he takes his control of\nthe country to a new level, making sure that he'll\nnever be challenged again. (intense music) (protestors chanting in Russian) - They started arrested\npeople like me and my friends, regular protestors, first\nby dozens, then by hundreds, and then by thousands across the country. - [Blurred Speaker] Russia ten years ago and Russia right now, are\ntwo different countries. - [Blurred Speaker 5] The\n(indistinct) election of Putin like became kind of milestone. And this is like really\nhuge historical events that divided our country,\nlike, our history, into, you know, before and after. - So that was like 10 years ago. And since then, the people in Russia have kind of experienced\nthe kind of proverbial frog in boiling water thing. Where year after year, they've seen a long\nbut slow transformation of their society, their rights, and perhaps most notably, where\nthey get their information. - In the past several\nyears it's became a norm to get beaten up at a protests, to get up to 15 days, 30 days of detention for taking part in a protest. - Every single year, people's perception of what\nthe government can do to them shifted to accept more and\nmore oppressive actions. - And this is where that\nlist that I was looking at kind of started, and it started small and bureaucratic. Putin's party passes\nthis Foreign Agent Law, basically saying that any\norganization in Russia that receives any money\nfrom any other country is now required to put a big\nbadge on anything they publish that says that like, \"Hey,\nI'm a foreign agent.\" and if they don't comply, they have to pay a huge fine. At first, this just seems\nlike a bureaucratic thing, but this law would lay a foundation to help the Putin regime censor\nwhoever they didn't like. - All types of media outlets,\nbloggers, TV channels, and even newspapers that don't support Putin's Ukraine invasion are\nlabeled as foreign agents. - Which in Russian sounds\nmore like foreign spy. - It means that anything\npublished by those outlets now has to include a huge disclaimer declaring something like, \"This article was written\nby a foreign agent that obeys the West and\nspreads its false propaganda.\" - The next year they passed\nthis gay propaganda law, claiming that they must urgently\nprotect Russia's children against the West's moral decay by prohibiting the discussion\nor promotion of homosexuality and LGBT rights among minors. You could call this the\noriginal, \"Don't Say Gay Law.\" - And I remember this very\nloud case when they outlawed basically LGBTQ plus youth support group. And they took the founders to court. It was incredibly stressful\nfor many, many people because they were doing very good work. They were helping young people\nwho were confused and scared and maybe not accepted for their identity, and they were taken to court for it. - [Blurred Speaker] As part\nof LGBTQ plus community, I can say that we don't\nhave any rights or freedoms in Russia, it's just not for us. - [Johnny] And then in\nthe next year, 2014, Putin annexes Crimea. - Russian President, Vladimir Putin casts his shadow across the\nboundary of Europe and Russia. - [News Caster] Russian\ntroops spreading out throughout the strategic\nCrimean peninsula. - And this is where we start\nto see a giant disconnect between like what happens in\nRussia and here in the West. Here in the West, we saw this\nland grab and we were like, \"What is happening? This is so terrible.\" But the fact is most Russians loved this. I mean, look at this guy's popularity. It springs up to an all-time\nhigh after he invades and steals land. And this is because Putin is really good at appealing to a certain yearning within a big part of\nthe Russian population. I mean, listen to his annexation speech where he calls Crimea, quote, \"An inseparable part of Russia.\" (Putin speaking Russian) - He claims that he has\nthis firm conviction that is based on truth and justice. Like, Putin is a good storyteller. He is a strong, magnetic\nleader, and we lose out on that because we don't understand his language and he just looks like a villain. But many Russians, a\nlot of them who remember the chaos of the post-Soviet years, see Putin as a strong leader, someone who's willing to\nstick up for Russian identity and values in a chaotic\nand changing world. So yeah, he's super popular. But then the West punishes\nhim by cutting him off from the economy as\npunishment for stealing land and bankrolling a war\nin the east of Ukraine. And this war in Ukraine drags on instead of being a quick\nvictory like he hoped. But if there's anything I've\nlearned about Vladimir Putin in these years, it's that\nwhen he takes a loss, he just responds by doubling down. By 2016, Russian society is\nstarting to look much less free than it was four years earlier. Putin's government has now passed laws forcing internet providers\nto store user data and to cooperate with\nRussian law enforcement, even if it means sharing people's private encrypted messages. One thing that aspiring dictators know is that staying in power means controlling what people think. And to do that, you must\ncontrol the information that they have access to. (intense music) - [Speaker] He understood that\nhe should take under control every media outlet in Russia. Radio, TV, internet, everything. - The first target is Russian TV channels. He chips away these\nuntil almost all of them are owned or influenced by the government. (news anchor speaking Russian) - [Johnny] Eventually\nthere's only one non-state TV channel standing. (news narrator speaking Russian) - [Johnny] But then, suspiciously, Russia's cable providers\nstop airing this TV channel to 18 million Russian homes, effectively censoring it completely. They get evicted from their\nstudio in downtown Moscow. And by 2015, every television in Russia is showing a version of reality that this one man wants them to see. (news anchor speaking Russian) - I mean you're watching\nthis video on the internet and you're like, \"Who cares? It's TV, no one watches TV.\" But in Russia people do watch TV. 70% of the population, which is literally like\na hundred million people get their news from TV. TV that they're watching daily. Like in a lot of parts of the world, the television is the\ngateway that people have to see the world, to understand the world, to make up their minds about the world. We cannot underestimate TV. A hundred million people. - If you're like a Russian grandma, and like you're cooking dinner and oh, there's TV on background. This is just like their\nonly source and news, like television, and it's terrible. - Propaganda became much\nmore prominent on TV. It was basically the only\nnarrative you could find. - There is no TV channels in Russia that not under the state, that not under the Kremlin. - [Blurred Speaker] Nowadays\nRussian TV is just one big endless storm of different\nkinds of propaganda. - I just cannot watch Russian TV. It's just impossible to watch it myself. (news anchor speaking Russian) (news anchor speaking Russian) - I mean, let's just clarify one thing. Every country has totally\npolarized slanted television. Like here in the US, we have news channels\nthat are totally slanted to one side or the other and will often just toe the line of whoever's in power if\nthey align with their views. Like this Russian guy spewing propaganda on Russian state TV, kind of doesn't sound that\ndifferent to like Tucker Carlson talking about Donald Trump. The reality is that all\ninformation has a bent, has a bias. I really believe that. The difference is that\nthis is all they get. You can't click away\nto an opposing channel to get another view. I don't speak Russian,\nwhich is a big bummer because I really wanted to just like, watch a bunch of Russian TV and\nlike see what it feels like. Luckily Putin's government has\nme covered, check this out. (upbeat music) - The US plan is to drag this war out as long as they possibly can. - [Automated Voice] This war\nis a war of the United States against Europe. - The Russian government\nhas built a full-blown international news outlet\nthat is Russian state TV but in English and a\nbunch of other languages. It's called \"Russia Today\". And boy is it a treat. - There is no hope under heaven\nfor any Ukrainian military victory against the\nRussian professional army. - [Automated Voice] Ukrainian\nfighters caught on camera using ambulance for transportation. - This stuff is super valuable actually because not only does it teach us what propaganda looks like, but it also gives us an alternative view on how these events are being seen, which is really helpful for\nquestioning your own biases and trying to make sense\nof how information works in this world. RT was banned from YouTube for\nbeing full blown propaganda, but they still published their\nvideos, and I found where. Bingo, RT. They publish a lot of videos. Like tons and tons and tons of videos. I mean they're a news outlet. And a lot of it is \"Putin\non Russia's Support for African Nations\", \"The Anti-Hero of the Year\" Oh, and look, we've got Tucker Carlson. - Has made it official, they're calling him not only\nthe the person of the year but also the most\ninfluential person in Europe. And it's notable because there\nhave been a number of people who have been quick to\nrush to social media calling out this decision, saying that they don't agree with it, and also referring to the\nhypocrisy surrounding it. And that includes Fox\nNews host Tucker Carlson, take a listen to what\nhe had to say about it. - Zelenskyy has no interest\nin freedom and democracy. In fact, Zelenskyy is far closer to Lenin than to George Washington. He's a dictator. Over the past years. - Yeah, so there's some alignment here. I mean a lot of this stuff\nis just regular news. It's not all propaganda, but it's when you get\ninto how RT is covering the war in Ukraine that you kind of start to\nfeel like you're on drugs. - [News Announcer] People\nhere feel terrorized by the Ukrainian military who continue shelling them every day. - [Translator] Ukraine\nhates us and that's it. They want to destroy us. - Ukrainian nationalist forces continue shelling civilians here\nin the city of Donetsk. - Like this documentary,\nthat is just wild. It's called \"Nuclear Blackmail\" and it's a story about\na Ukrainian power plant that, a reminder, Russia\ninvaded and is occupying. But this whole documentary\nis about the poor locals who are being attacked\nby brutal Ukrainians, totally unprovoked, even though it's Russia\nwho's occupying the country. Okay, but wait, pause, we\njust have to have a moment. I want to go on with the story, but I also wanna just\nsay something right here because it's actually really important. I've been watching a lot of\nRussian TV for this story and while it's really\neasy to roll your eyes at this stuff, or laugh\nat it, or condemn it because some of it is\njust full on fake news, a lot of this is actually more subtle, not full-blown inventing the truth. And in fact, I think the\nvalue of watching this is it shows you the kind\nof cherry picking of facts and interpretations that they're\nable to do on their side. And then you start to see the\nsame type of cherry picking that media companies here in the West do for the worldview that suits them. And you start to realize\nthat all journalism is at some point cherry picking. You're deciding what to put\nin and what to leave out. And it often comes with biases. I see the same type of cherry picking from Western news organizations. Hell, I do this! It's a lot easier for me\nto publish a story to you about how bad Vladimir Putin is, than to cover, I don't know, the potential war crimes\ncommitted by Ukrainian soldiers against Russian soldiers recently based on a video that\nthe New York Times broke. Like I don't wanna look into that. That doesn't really line up. That's a lot harder thing to cover. It's easier for me to cover\nthe narrative that fits with what you all want to\nsee and what you all believe. And that's kind of scary. Watching Russian TV, it's\nnot something I recommend, but I'm saying that this propaganda can help wake us up to what\nsensors we need to have on when we're ingesting information. So yeah, stay skeptical and curious and resist the urge of\njust blind side taking. That's my PSA for today. Let's get back to the story. (intense music) - [Automated Voice] The\nUnited States is interested in severing ties between Russia\nand Europe and also China. - Okay, so back to our timeline. It's 2017, a hundred million Russians are being fed a version of reality that their autocratic\nleader wants them to see. But there's one place that Vladimir Putin hasn't reached yet. And that is the place that\nyou are currently right now, this place called youtube.com. So by 2017, if you want to be an independent news outlet in Russia, your life looks like this. At the top of every single\ntweet you have to put this, which basically says,\n\"I am a foreign agent. This message material is created and or distributed by a foreign mass media performing the functions\nof a foreign agent.\" Like you can't even put a tweet here because all of your\ncharacters are taken up by the foreign agent disclaimer. \"RIP, anything good?\" Every single one of these. And if you don't do this, if you break one little\nforeign agent rule, you get slapped with a fine. And this is where the Foreign Agent Law starts to get weaponized\nagainst journalists. One outlet did an interview\nwith Putin's big enemy, Alexei Navalny. Soon after they got hit with a fine for non-compliance with\nthe Foreign Agent Law. They end up having to\npay $340,000 as a fine, which ends up bankrupting them. And they had to do to do\nlike a crowdsourcing campaign to like, make the money back. They were almost squashed because\nof this Foreign Agent Law. This hostile environment for journalists is what led many to leave\nand come to YouTube. And one of the major pioneers for that was Alexei Navalny. (Alexei Navalny speaking Russian) - I made a whole video\nabout Alexei Navalny and how badass he is\nas an opponent to Putin and how he used YouTube\nto like troll Putin while also exposing corruption in Russia. - Everybody just watched\nthis and said, \"Oh my god. So that what you can do on YouTube.\" - That's Michael. He's a Russian YouTuber\nwho you will hear more from in a second. Alexia Navalny showed that you could have huge audiences on YouTube, saying things that weren't\nreally allowed to be said anywhere else. And media companies\ncould actually make money without advertisers fleeing\nbecause they're foreign agents. - In Russia that you\ndon't have a lot of choice if you want to be in media sphere. (Maria Borzxunova speaking Russian) - Another huge pioneer in all of this, was this guy, Yuri Dud. He started in 2017,\nand was an instant hit. (Yuri Dud speaking Russian) (speaker speaking Russian) - This guy was a sports journalist. He didn't set out to like\ncompletely reshape journalism in Russia, but he did. (interviewer speaking Russian) - Sex. - Like I watched this stuff and I don't fully know\nhow to make sense of it. It doesn't fit into any\nbox that I'm used to. These videos are super long. We're talking like hour and\n56 minutes, 12 million views, hour and 54 minutes, 22 million views. Yuri Dud's videos are like, I don't know, 60 minutes blended with Anderson Cooper, but mixed with a little Jimmy Kimmel's \"Celebrities Read Mean Tweets\". All of this except for\nlike Anderson Cooper is reading the tweets and he probably wrote some of them too. Also, Anderson Cooper is wearing a hoodie. Oh, and all of this is\ntaking place on YouTube, a website where millions\nof Russians are watching two and a half hour long interviews with guests they maybe never heard of. I mean, this is wild. Like I'm a YouTuber, I'm a storyteller. I don't understand this. But what I do understand\nis 10 million subscribers and like 22 million views. This guy paved the way for\na new set of Russian voices in an independent space outside of the grasp of the Putin regime. - People who watched TV, they believed some things for eight years while people who watched YouTube, they had totally different opinion. - You could find interviews\nwith like politicians, opposition politicians in Russia that you wouldn't otherwise see on TV. (Irina speaking Russian) - Another pioneer in this\nspace is Irina Shikhman, who I got to talk to for this story. Irina came from TV as well. She was like a traditional host who took the leap to go to\nYouTube and found freedom. She's a foreign agent. She has to put the\nforeign agent disclaimer at the front of every one of her videos. \"I'm a foreign agent, don't give me advertising money, squash me and make me feel little because Vladimir Putin hates me.\" Her videos are incredibly\nprofessional and very well done. Very interesting conversations. (Irina speaking Russian) - We also got to talk to Karen Shainyan, an openly gay journalist in\na country that criminalizes quote, \"gay propaganda\". Shainyan launched a YouTube channel about queer culture and identity in 2020. - Because there is not any other place to put any freedom of speech in Russia. You just can't. Everything is like closed,\nblocked, and canceled. This is the only platform\nthat is still safe. Russian authorities cannot, technically, they cannot block your YouTube channel. I launched my own YouTube channel starting with series of interviews\nwith openly queer people. And I actually started it\nwith like American guests because none of Russian celebrities would even imagine that\nthey can participate in such project. - YouTube was a safe\nplace for a long time. It was the place where these\njournalists could publish to huge audiences to say what they want. To be able to run a business,\nto get advertisement. And like I said at the\nbeginning, everyone we talked to, every journalist is now a foreign agent. They're now on a registry with their name, their birthday, their tax number, and their classification\nas a foreign agent. And this, this is what's\ndeveloping right now. The Putin regime has not been savvy enough to really crack down on the internet, the same way that maybe China has done. But what they are doing\nis using this familiar Soviet style registry to\ncreate enemies of the people. The people they don't\nlike, they put on a list. They make them taboo, they make what they have\nto say not valid anymore. And in doing so, they start to extend their\ncontrol to these spaces that used to be free. But while YouTube has\nremained outside of the grasp of Vladimir Putin and his regime, it doesn't mean that it's totally safe. - Everything changed on February\n24th when the war started. (explosion booming) (gunshots banging) (Irina speaking Russian) - The main thing that changed is that you need to take a side, you need to choose a side. So if you don't speak about that, you choose the side of Russian government. You choose the side of Russian\narmy and Vladimir Putin who kill people right now. So it's a still a position\neven if you just mute. (Maria Borzunova speaking Russian) - Within a week of the invasion, the parliament pushed through a series of draconian censorship laws. Things like publishing false information about the Russian government or the Russian military could now land you in prison for 15 years. What this meant is that Russians\ncouldn't call this a war. They had to play by the silly pretend term \"Special Military Operation\". And this wasn't just on paper. So far over 4,000 journalists have been prosecuted under\nthese new censorship laws. - [Blurred Speaker] Modern Putin's Russia is more like a jail than a country. - I'm not even sure we\nstill have any rights. - [Blurred Speaker] My\nrights and freedoms, I feel they are constantly\ndisappearing from Russia. - After the invasion, all independent media has\neither ceased to exist or was physically forced out of country. - Someone can actually get arrested and serve time if they\njust say the word war. No, you didn't mishear me. Just simply war. Not even (bleep) war or war sucks, because now we have to call\nit \"a special operation\". - Speaking out on social\nmedia became dangerous. Journalists fled the country soon after the law was initiated. - The censorship became really strong, like way stronger than even before. - Me personally, I condemned this war publicly and lost about hundred\nthousand subscribers. Just from my opinion. - [Blurred Speaker] I am\nreally shocked by people who are protest now in a good way. They are amazing people. They're really brave persons. - [Blurred Speaker 3] That's\njust an act of bravery nowadays to go in the protest. (Irina speaking Russian) - But the Kremlin has stopped short of actually shutting down YouTube. In part because they have an\nincentive to keep it open. A lot of Russian propagandists use the platform to spread their message. - Everyone since the beginning\nof war has been saying, \"Well, they're going to\nblock YouTube tomorrow.\" \"In a week.\" \"In two weeks.\" But there were constant\nrumors that YouTube was going to be blocked. And guess what? It is not. My theory is that they\ndon't have capacities in order to block your YouTube. They just are not capable of doing that. - YouTube is kind of game changer in the modern Russian media landscape. - [Blurred Speaker] YouTube\nbecame like the last bastion of freedom of speech, free from Kremlin\ncensorship here in Russia. - Our government wants to close YouTube, but they can't, 'cause they're afraid of big outrage. - [Blurred Speaker] It's\nhard to underestimate the value of YouTube nowadays. - Russian speaking YouTube creators are now in the tough situation. Because all the videos shot\nfor the Russian audience are now fully demonetized. But we still continue to make videos because who else is gonna\ntell the truth if not us? - A lot of us will\ncontinue to do what we do because we do it not for actually views or subscribers, like the count of them, but because we think\nthat it's very important. - It was clear to me that if you are an independent journalist, it is not safe anymore\nto stay in the country. So I fled to first Armenia, and later I ended up here in Berlin. - [Johnny] And yet even from afar, they're able to broadcast\nto their audience and share the truth, to be an independent voice in a place that is more and more\ncut off from information. - If it wasn't for Putin and his system, like there are so many people in Russia who can like do really great things. Putin and his peers, they're\njust not letting us do that. And it's terrible and tragic. (mysterious music) - So Vladimir Putin has\nbeen in power for 23 years. And his goal is finally within reach. His regime today has a near\nmonopoly on information. And while YouTube has been a haven for independent journalists\nand dissenting voices to be able to share their perspectives, but he's moving in on that too. Threatening to punish them if they don't put this big\nsign on all of their content. that says they are\ninfluenced by foreign agents. Or what this sign really says, which is that these, these\npeople, these journalists, these voices, have been\ndeemed an enemy of the people. - [Blurred Speaker] I\nfeel the deepest grief and the deepest, you know, guilt and the special responsibility for every murder that happened in Ukraine because of the Russian. - Before war, I never\nreally thought of myself as a patriotic person. And now when I see that my country is destroying another country, and it's basically destroying itself, it's painful to watch. - [Blurred Speaker] In Russia, of course, there's a long way to go, but I do feel like Russia is\ngoing like tiny little steps, especially because the young people are having all this access to information. Like, minds are being opened. - Thanks to YouTube, we have a chance, we have opportunity, even in dictatorship, to spread information to people, to people in Russia, not in Russia. Every part of world. Even when dictators try\nto kill every possibility of freedom of speech. - Actually I'm very optimistic. And soon we gonna see\ntotally different country, or maybe several countries\non the territory of Russia. (Irina speaking Russian) - [Blurred Speaker] Peace to\nUkraine, freedom for Russia. - Hey, thanks for watching. Thank you to the many,\nmany, many Russian people who spoke to me. A lot of them on the\ncondition of anonymity because for obvious reasons,\nI don't even need to say why. And to the YouTubers who spoke to me, there's so much more\nin these conversations that I couldn't include. I'm gonna publish some of\nthis over on \"The Newsroom\". \"The Newsroom\" is our\nPatreon where you can come and support independent\njournalism here on YouTube. On \"The Newsroom\", we publish\nan extra video every month. The video is a behind the\nscenes on how we do what we do. And you can see it all. You can see the behind the scenes of this wild and crazy studio, and all of the people who are here helping make these videos possible. We also publish uncut interviews and you get royalty free music\nfrom our composer Tom Fox. And you get to see my scripts. If you wanna see how my scripts are made, which are not just scripts, they're very involved documents that I use to direct these videos. But most importantly,\nit's a way to support what we're trying to do here, which is rigorous independent\njournalism on YouTube. Which, I don't know if\nYouTube was ever meant to support this, but we're finding out. So, other ways you can support are purchasing our LUTs and presets, which are the way that we\ncolor our videos and photos. We developed those with\na professional colorist, they're really good. And you can just be\nhere watching the vids, commenting, sharing, doing all the things. I appreciate everyone here\nand the attitude they have of trying to make us\nall smarter and better and more curious. There's just a lot of that\npositive energy in this community and I really appreciate it. So, thank you all. But, and I guess what I'm\nfeeling a lot of right now is just gratitude, that I can say whatever I wanna say here and I don't have a big,\npowerful, scary government telling me that I'm a foreign agent or that I'm not allowed to say that. I take that for granted\nand I don't think I should, because it's really special\nthat we get to do this. So, anyway, hope you all are having a good winter and I'll talk to you soon.

It's a French word that\nmeans a punch or a blow, because it kind of means coming in and forcibly punching out\na government from power. No elections, no process,\njust power being seized, just someone being pushed\nout and someone being put in. Coups happen in so many different ways, but I wanna show you how\nthe coup has been used by the United States of America as a tool to get what they\nwant on the world stage. So let me walk you through some of the major US-led\ncoups over the years to show you that, while\nit sometimes seems like we live in a world full\nof order and rules, the reality is that the\nmost powerful countries will often get their way by\nwhatever means necessary. Okay, so here's how I'm defining the US-led coups that I'm\ngonna put on our list here. Number one, they were successful. There's a lot of failed coup attempts. We're leaving those out. Number two, there must be at least one US government\nofficial involved in the coup. And number three, we need\nconcrete evidence that the US was actually involved,\nnot just speculation. While the US has been involved in tons of regime change\nefforts around the world, we landed on a much shorter list. These are the coups that I think best exemplify how this tool has been used for international power over the years. Let's start here, (distorted, cheesy Hawaiian music) in the independent country of Hawaii. it's 1893 and the US is feeling\nlike the Hawaiian queen is a threat to American control over sugar. It's sugar that's being grown by the descendants of white\nAmerican missionaries who had settled in Hawaii over the years. So the US sends a military\nship with hundreds of troops to show up to Honolulu, and they overthrow the queen, installing one of those descendants of\nthe Christian missionaries Sanford B. Dole as the new president. Notice his last name? Yeah, this coup was one of the US's first, and it set the stage not only for the new\nHawaiian president's family to grow their powerful\ninternational corporation, which was based in Hawaii, but also for Hawaii to be annexed, to become a part of the United States. I made a whole video on this\ncoup because it's pretty wild and there's so much going on here. And it was really a turning point in showing how the US could\nremove leaders from power in far away places, something that they start\nto do a lot more of. We're gonna move on to the next coup, but I need to thank today's sponsor who makes these videos possible. Thank you Nord VPN for\nsponsoring today's video. I've started using Nord VPN\nfor a lot of different things. When I'm traveling, I connect to the internet\nvia the United States so that all of my accounts\ndon't freak out thinking that I'm someone from another country\nlogging into my accounts. Oh, and by the way, that\nallows me to like watch Netflix from different countries as\nwell, which is kind of cool, but it's more than that. It is a password manager,\nit is a malware blocker. It blocks annoying ads, it\nhelps you encrypt files. It provides all these\nlayers of extra security, which more and more is\nsomething that we all need. And the best part is you don't have to be a\ntechnical person to do this. It's one click away and you\nhave all of this protection, or you can have it just\nconnect automatically and you just have it\nrunning in the background. And not just for one computer. When you sign up for Nord, you can get up to six devices\nthat are all protected by Nord's many different\nlayers of security. And at the end of the day, you don't have to take my word for it. You can go try it out, and\nif it's not useful to you, you get all your money back. For 30 days, so it's like a trial period. Oh, and Nord VPN just turned 11 years old, and so if you click the\nlink in my description, for a limited time, you will\nget a free mystery gift. Not totally sure what it is, but who doesn't like a free mystery gift? Thank you Nord VPN for\nsponsoring today's video. Let's get back into the map. I gotta get outta here because\nthings are about to heat up. We got a lot more to cover on these coups. The next coup has to do with Spain. Well, actually more like Spain's colonies. (percussive ambient music) Spain's glory days have come and gone. They are a declining empire and there is major\nresistance in their colonies, especially in Cuba, Puerto\nRico, and the Philippines. Meanwhile, the US is a rising empire and they already are\npretty uncomfortable with Spain having colonies like a\nhundred miles off their coast. But at the same time, they\ndon't love the idea of true independence for places\nlike Cuba or Puerto Rico. These are strategic islands\nright in the US's neighborhood. And like Hawaii, American\ncompanies have money invested, particularly in Cuba. Independence might mean\nthem getting kicked out. So the US delves into this fight between Spain and their colonies. They use the explosion\nof an American Navy ship as their excuse, even though it was likely\nan accident, not an attack. But sometimes stories\nmatter more than truth. So the US sends in troops\nto liberate the rebels fighting against their Spanish colonizers, promising them independence, not only in Cuba and Puerto Rico, but later, over here in\nthe Philippines and Guam. These local uprisings eventually\ndrive out the Spanish, and in all of these cases, the\nUS reneges on their promise to give independence to these locals. And they figure out ways to\ngovern Cuba and Puerto Rico indirectly themselves. The US has just piggybacked off several independence movements to enact several coups at once, allowing them to install\npro-American leaders and a Navy base in Cuba, and eventually annexing\nPuerto Rico and Guam, which they still control, and the Philippines, which\nthey held for 48 years. Again, I made a whole\nvideo about this one too if you wanna go deeper. Anyway, we gotta move\na little quicker here because we're not gonna get\nthrough all these coups. Let's move on. Okay, so we're over here\nin Nicaragua, it's 1909. (bright, quaint piano music) There's a bunch of powerful\nAmerican companies here, but a new president comes to\npower, vowing to regulate them. The US is not gonna let this happen. So the Secretary of State\nstarts spreading rumors to smear this guy, this president, saying that he's building a canal that would compete with the Panama Canal. But really they're just upset because Nicaragua was taking loans from Europe. The US keeps painting\nthis guy as a war criminal and someone worthy of being thrown out. So, push comes to shove and the US sends ships to\nboth of Nicaragua's coasts. They assemble a bunch\nof Marines in Panama, basically just flexing on Nicaragua and telling the president to step down. And the benefit of being a\nrising superpower is that it worked, he has no\nchoice but to step down. And soon a leader that the\nUS likes comes to power. The coup is complete. And really, this is the\nfirst of many instances of the US meddling in Nicaragua. A few years later, the\nUS is back in the region for another coup in next door Honduras. This one was plotted by a band\nof private American citizens and it follows a similar pattern. A new president comes to town, in this case directly inspired\nby Nicaragua's president, and he wants to take back\ncontrol of the country from American businesses. In this case we're talking about bananas. The banana companies were\nnot gonna let this happen. And it was mostly this guy, a banana businessman\nnamed Sam the Banana Man. He's not gonna let this pesky\npresident run his country, no. So he assembles his own militia, he literally buys a surplus Navy ship, loads it up with weapons, and starts his campaign\nto get this president out. He sails from New Orleans\nto the coast of Honduras and he literally invades the country with, like, a private army. Wait, what? Where's the\nUS government in all this? They also didn't like the political direction\nof Honduras either. So they just sort of stood back, let this private invasion happen. And then at the critical moment, the US steps in to order a ceasefire, basically bullying the\npresident to step down. He had no way forward, no\ndefense, so he resigns. (urgent synth music) And the Banana Man's leader of\nchoice takes the presidency, giving the banana businessman\nland and a unique status to import anything he needs tax free and, wait for it, he refunds him for all of the coup expenses\nusing public Honduran money. This Banana Man literally\noverthrew the government and made Honduras pay for it. Wow. Okay, so let's move\nforward to the '50s where the coup becomes a more useful\ntool in the American toolkit. There's this new US agency dedicated to collecting\nand analyzing information from all over the world,\nmeaning for spying. They call it the Central\nIntelligence Agency, the CIA. And it completely revolutionizes\nthe art of the coup. Oh, and at this point, the US is now a full-blown\nglobal superpower. No longer just looking in\ntheir own neighborhood, but rather at the whole world map, investing huge resources into fighting their global rival\nand its communist ideology. So this gets us to Iran 1953,\nwhere Iran had just elected a new star politician, Mohammed Mosaddegh. He rises the power believing that Iran must take back control of its most valuable natural resource, oil, which at the time was\ncompletely controlled by a British company called the\nAnglo-Iranian Oil Company. We know it today as BP. Mosaddegh is done with this. \"Let's kick the British\nout and take back our oil.\" But like the US, Britain is not happy with Iranians trying to take\nback their resources. So they warn that if they do this, there will be consequences. So the British catch a quick meeting with the CIA's Middle East guy, who was passing through London, and they pitch him on this idea. \"Let's throw out Mosaddegh.\" The CIA's like, \"Okay.\" And they kind of sniff\ncommunist vibes on Mosaddegh with this big desire to\nnationalize Iran's oil. Or at least they tell themselves they do. So the CIA agrees, and they\nsecretly send this guy to Iran. He's the Middle East Bureau\nchief, Kermit Roosevelt, he's like in his thirties. Oh, and yes, he is the grandson of another big coup guy, Teddy Roosevelt, who I have gone into in other videos. Roosevelt sneaks into Iran and is given a million\ntaxpayer dollars to use, quote, \"in any way that would bring\nabout the fall of Mosaddegh.\" So now there's American CIA agents in Iran secretly trying to\noverthrow the government. And it's a rocky start at\nfirst, with a bunch of failures. But they start using their\nmoney to get traction, bribing politicians, religious\nclerics, and other leaders to say divisive and controversial\nthings about Mosaddegh. They hire locals to stage attacks\nagainst religious leaders, making it look like they had been ordered\nto do so by Mosaddegh, but really, they were getting\npaid by the CIA to do this. And with enough time and money, they create an atmosphere\nof chaos and hostility and distrust among the public. Oh, and there's weapons. The CIA stashes enough weapons\nand explosives to support a, quote, \"10,000 man guerilla\norganization for six months.\" Like, just in case they need\nto start a full-on conflict. The result of all of this is more violence and chaos\nthat engulfs the capitol. Shops are being destroyed,\nbullets are flying into mosques, people are beaten, and thousands of paid\ndemonstrators flood the street. The city falls into anarchy, all of it orchestrated by CIA money. And in the end, this all results in a bloody shootout at Mosaddegh's house. He eventually gives up\nand turns himself in. He's put through a sham trial\nand found guilty of treason and sentenced to three years\nin solitary confinement and then house arrest, where\nhe stayed until his death. The previous ruler of Iran, Mohammed Reza Shah,\nwhich just means \"King,\" had fled the country. But now, with the democratically\nelected Mosaddegh gone and with the backing of the US and UK, he could charter a flight back\ninto Iran and take control. - [TV Reporter] The Shah crowns himself in a tradition which\ngoes back 25 centuries. His title is King of Kings, and he becomes emperor of his nation. (suspenseful string music) - [Narrator] The US really\ncame out on top here. They got what they wanted. They now have an\nAmerican-friendly dictator in a powerful country in the Middle East who is now welcoming\nAmerican oil companies to get in on one of the\nlargest oil reserves on Earth. Under the Shaw, Iran becomes\na brutal police state. He executed military\nofficers, student leaders, anyone associated with Mosaddegh. He set up a secret police\nforce, and life was brutal. So brutal that in 1979,\nthe frustration of Iranians burst forth in mass protests that ran the Shaw out of office and replaced him with\nan inspiring new leader who would turn Iran\ninto an Islamic Republic built in part off a\nfoundation of resentment for the US having\nmeddled in their country. The Islamic Republic has\nheld power ever since, and has morphed into the\noppressive theocracy we know today, though maybe not for long. Before we go on, a quick\nreminder that all of these coups, these plans to overthrow\nleaders in other countries, did not require American\nvotes or consensus or approval of Congress. It was usually just a few key men in government buildings in Washington DC making this happen. These people would go on\nto define the Cold War and shape so many covert\noperations around the world, many of which we'll never know about. Okay, let's keep going.\n(urgent drum music) The next year in Guatemala, the CIA tried to pull the same playbook that they used in Iran, once again targeting a leader\nthat the people had elected, but who wanted to take back\nthe country's resources for the people, to break up these American monopolies that controlled the country's\nelectricity and railroad. The president even starts to seize land from one massive banana company. It was often unused land that\nhe wanted to redistribute to the locals who could farm\nit and feed their families and hopefully climb out of the system of endemic\npoverty in the country. Once again, I made a whole video on this, the geopolitics of bananas\nin Central America. But the fact is that the US decided that they had to defend the banana companies or else more communist\nreforms would spread. So the US president and secretary of state ordered an overthrow, and the CIA got right to work. The CIA hand selects a leader\nthat they want to be in power and then they start giving\nequipment and training to a bunch of Guatemalan\nexiles and private soldiers. They set up a secret operation base on the outskirts of Miami. They start delivering\nweapons to the Panama Canal. But like the other coups, it can't just all be about weapons. They gotta own the information space. So they create a radio station that sounds like it's a local\nGuatemala radio station, but really it's being operated out of a small town in Florida. And they start publishing fake news about an uprising, unrest, a rebellion. And then at the same time, the fighters that the\nCIA had trained and armed invades Guatemala. Pilots start dropping bombs on fuel tanks and military\nposts and airports. But they weren't starting a full-on war. They weren't trying to cause real damage. They wanted it to feel\nlike a domestic uprising, like a war was on the horizon, to freak people out, and\nfor many it totally worked. They thought that this was a real uprising and had no idea that the\nCIA was behind it all. But the president knew what was up. He had messed with the USA\nand now he's hearing about it. Military leaders in his circle\nare feeling the pressure from the big bully from the north and they turn on him and\nhe eventually surrenders. On his way out, the president\naddresses his people, makes it very clear that, quote, \"The United Fruit Company, in collaboration with the United States, is responsible for what\nis happening to us.\" And just like that, one president is out and the handpicked CIA option is in. This new regime is brutal and\ngoes on to do horrible things, detaining people they\nthought were communists, killing prisoners,\nbreaking up labor unions, and in the process restoring\nthe banana company's land and ensuring that they maintained their hold on this economy. This kicks off an era in Guatemala of more political\nassassinations and instability, something that still\nplagues the country today. And yet to this day,\nthere is no evidence that the Soviets were ever slightly\ninterested in Guatemala. Communism was once again the excuse, but really this was about securing American business interests, tearing a country apart for bananas. \u266a Bananas taste the best\nand are the best for you \u266a All right, let's go to Africa. So, it's 1960 here in\nthe center of Africa, a country called Congo. They just gained\nindependence from Belgium, and they have an election, and this guy Patrice Lumumbau wins, becomes the prime minister. But immediately, over in Washington, the communist alarm bells\ninstantly start sounding off, because we're in the\nmiddle of the Cold War and Congo is a place full of\ntons of natural resources, including loads of uranium, the main ingredient for nuclear bombs. This is at a time when Americans are keeping gas\nmasks next to their bed and have hordes of canned\ngoods in their basements. And officials in Washington can't risk Congo falling into the\ninfluence of the Soviet Union. So they start focusing\non this prime minister. The CIA director called him, quote, \"An urgent and prime\nobjective\" that should quote, \"be a high priority\nof our covert action.\" So they pull a more political\ncoup than the ones before. They start allying with\nLumumbau's political enemies and Congo's former colonizer, Belgium. They bribe politicians, they fund protests and labor movements, and they circulate propaganda, similar ingredients to the previous coups. And when the moment is right, all these bribed politicians\ndo what the CIA asked them to. They'd remove Lumumba from\npower, and the CIA is right there giving money and intelligence and advice to the new government. This political solution was\nactually not the first try. The CIA had tried to assassinate\nLumumbau in the past, but all of those attempts failed, which is why they turned to hijacking and manipulating\nCongolese politics, a brand new democracy, supporting the people who\nwould eventually go on to put Lumumba in front of a Congolese and Belgian firing squad, making this effectively\na political assassination supported from an ocean away. And yet there's so much\ngray area in these coups. In this case, it's really tough to prove that the CIA's support was the key factor in\nLumumbau's assassination. It's debated to this day. An effective foreign-sponsored\ncoup works like this, operating in the shadows,\nfueling divisions, appealing to the worst demons\nof the people on the ground through money, through influence. All right, let's move on to\nthe Caribbean in the 1960s. (urgent synth music) There's a brutal dictator here\nin the Dominican Republic. I mean, this guy's really bad. He's rumored to feed\nhis opponents to sharks. But anyway, what the\nUS cares about is that there's fear that a communist revolution could happen at any moment. So the CIA sends weapons\nto a group of of hitmen who go assassinate this guy. It ends up being an\nambush and a car chase. They're successful in taking him out, ending his 31-year rule. And eventually the US sends\nin forces to occupy the DR, to make sure that a leftist\ncandidate doesn't come to power. They restore order, and eventually a US-friendly\ncandidate is elected. Okay, so now we have to head\nover to Vietnam in 1963. (suspenseful string music) And boy, this is a way bigger\none than we have time for, but we're trying to focus\non the coup element of this. Vietnam was divided in two, between communist and\npro-Western governments. The US needs the South\nto stay on their side, but Washington starts to\nlose confidence in this guy, the South's leader, he's\nlosing a grip on the country, and the US fears that communism will take over the whole country of Vietnam. So the CIA rolls up its sleeves,\nit's time for another coup. This time they focus on a\nSouth Vietnamese general who also doesn't love the president, and he agrees to do the CIA's bidding. And when given the signal, the\ngeneral directs his military to seize the airport and radio stations, and they block off highways. They march to the presidential palace, a bloody shootout goes down, and this president,\nPresident Diem, escapes. He happens to be with his brother, but it's not going well for\nthem, so he realizes that he needs to set up a meeting to surrender. They're gonna meet at a Catholic church. This was probably gonna\nbe a peaceful meeting, but when the generals arrive, they just kill him on\nthe spot, saying, quote, \"To kill the weed, you\nmust pull up the roots.\" Meaning in order to solve\nthe problem, Diem must die. Exile was not enough. Now the US actually didn't\nplan for this to happen. They didn't want to kill this guy. It was not an official\norder from Washington. But they made this coup happen. JFK is said to be really\ndistraught about this. The first American Catholic\npresident behind the coup that killed the first\nVietnamese Catholic president. And incidentally, JFK was\nassassinated 20 days later. And one national security journalist argues that Diem's\nassassination actually had a greater impact on American\nhistory than the murder of JFK because it locked the US into a decade of conflict in Vietnam, which ballooned into a long war ending in an embarrassing defeat and a political crisis at home. One of the few coups where the US actually had to\ndeal with the aftermath. Okay, let's blast through a\nfew of these really quickly. I'm gonna skirt over some details here. It's 1964, and Brazil is potentially veering off into communism, with the rise of a new leftist leader. Lucky for the CIA, there's already a coup\nbeing plotted against him. So the US military just\nshows up with ships off the coast of Brazil. They airlift in a bunch of\nammunition and supplies. They didn't end up having\nto do much, actually. Instead, they just stood\nby with reinforcements and watched the Brazilian coup go down. The leftist leader goes down\nand a new leader comes in. In 1973, there's a coup in Chile that is a very complicated\nstory with conflicting accounts and we went down a super deep rabbit hole and we've decided that because the evidence is not rock solid, we're going to cut it for time, but definitely some crazy shit went down, I'm not saying it didn't. (urgent jazz drum music) Okay, we're back in Africa\nand it's the eighties. And over here in Libya, the\ndictator Muammar Gaddafi was making lots of trouble in the region, funding terrorist groups and working to expand his\ninfluence all over the region. Then he gets a call from his neighbor Chad asking for help against a rebellion. Gaddafi eagerly sends 4,000 troops to occupy a huge part of the country and makes friends with the new president by helping him exile his rival. And soon Gaddafi is getting greedy and threatening to merge Chad into Libya. The US is not into this. So Ronald Reagan fires up\nthe well-oiled coup machine, launching a covert war, sending weapons and\ncash to rebels in Chad, and supporting that political\nopponent who was ousted, helping him fight back, and it works. The president of Chad has to flee and the US backed and\nsupported leader comes to power and now there's a conflict, and the CIA continues arming the war even after this guy is in office. The new US-backed leader\nrules brutally for eight years until he's eventually overthrown\nby a military officer. And in 2013, he was charged\nwith crimes against humanity, torture and war crimes. Okay, now let's go to this\nlittle island in 1983. (percussive jazz music) It's communism again, and\nthe US sends 2,000 troops to invade this small remote island and remove their communist leader. They didn't really know much\nabout this small island, and they literally had to use tourism maps to plan their invasion. Anyway. American forces move in,\noverwhelm the Grenadian fighters who happen to be joined\nby their Cuban allies, the government collapses and the US-friendly leader comes to power. Okay, back down to Central America. It's 1989 and we're here in Panama where the US has control\nof a very important canal. And luckily the Panamanian\ndictator has been very friendly to American interests. But the US starts losing\nconfidence in this guy, wondering if he's really the best choice, ensuring the US maintain easy\naccess to their vital canal. Oh, and it didn't help that\nthis guy was indicted in Florida on drug trafficking and\nmoney laundering charges. We gotta get him out. But the straw that broke the\ncamel's back for this guy was when Panamanian troops killed an unarmed American\nsoldier in Panama City. The US is done with this guy, so they invade Panama with 27,000 troops. Panama's military is crushed and the dictator is eventually arrested and sentenced to 40 years in prison, and the US ensures access\nto its canal after all. Okay, so now it's the end of the 1980s and the Soviets are invading Afghanistan (urgent string music) and are meeting resistance\nfrom a bunch of fighters from all over the world who\nhave come to Afghanistan to fight back against\nthe Soviet occupation, many of them with fundamentalist\nreligious motivations. But the US doesn't care\nabout their motivation. They just care that that\nthey're willing to fight against the Soviets and the Soviets' puppet,\nthe Afghan president. And it totally works. With the help of the US, these fighters push the Soviets back and successfully run the\nAfghan president out of office. And as he's being run out of office, he forebodingly warns the Americans that if they leave Afghanistan in\nthe hands of these fighters, that it would, quote, \"Be turned into a center for terrorism.\" And his prophecy was completely fulfilled. Those US-funded fighters were people whose names we know\ntoday: Osama bin Laden, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, the\nguy who started the group that would eventually become ISIS. Those same weapons that the\nUS sent to counter the Soviets and to effect regime change in Afghanistan would go on to be used against\nAmerican soldiers years later when the US was back orchestrating yet another\nregime change after 9/11 against the very groups they once enabled. The US would eventually leave\nAfghanistan, only to find the country immediately\nfalling back into Taliban rule. We're almost to the end of our list and we're now in modern day, it's 2003, and 150,000 American troops invade Iraq. They say that they are\nthere to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction, but their main focus is taking\nout this guy, Saddam Hussein, which they do in a matter of weeks. Saddam fleeing into hiding and President Bush declaring\n\"mission accomplished,\" establishing an American-friendly\ngovernment in Iraq, creating once again a negative byproduct by alienating huge swaths\nof the Iraqi people and army who form a bunch of\nanti-American rebel groups that go on to fight against\nthe American occupation, some morphing into groups like ISIS who wreak all kinds of havoc\non the region to this day. Once again, I made a whole\nvideo about this topic. Go check it out. Iraq remains a place of\ndeep political instability. Trust in government is extremely low. And the question of\nhow and why we did this expensive, horrific, destructive coup is still something that there\naren't really good answers to. Again, you can go watch\nmy video for more on that. (pensive piano music) And this gets us to the\nfinal coup on our list. It's 2011, during a wave of protests spreading throughout this region, trying to take down all\nthese strongmen dictators, one of which was this guy Muammar Gaddafi. The same Gaddafi we were\ntalking about earlier who was like taking over Chad? He's still here and he's\nstill a very horrible dude. And there's worry that\nhe's gonna potentially massacre all of these\npro-democracy protestors. So the US feels like it must get involved to save these protestors. They rally their NATO allies to help them, but at some point the mission switches to total regime change. We don't know exactly how this happened, only the people in the room do. But is it surprising? We've seen this long arc\nof the US using the coup as a force for getting their way in an international conflict. It's a tried and true tool in the American foreign policy toolkit. So it's not surprising that\na coup becomes a solution during these difficult\ndecision-making processes. So anyway, the target becomes Gaddafi, and now NATO drones are\nfiring missiles at his convoy and he eventually gets captured\nand gets killed on the spot. Libya has been in chaos ever since, but it's not like it was a\ngreat place under Gaddafi. And once again, we're in a gray area where we don't know the history\nthat didn't happen or how things could have\nturned out different if the US didn't get involved. That debate lives on. Okay, so that's our list. These are our coups that we decided to go over in this video. And there are so many more\nthat we could have mentioned. My purpose in doing this\nbroad back-to-back history of American led coups was so that we can see\npatterns that emerge. How a rising superpower became really good at removing leaders that didn't align with their\nway of seeing the world or, in a lot of cases, who were not friendly to\nAmerican business interests. But let's be clear, the\nUS didn't invent this. This is something that powerful countries and\nempires have always done. What characterizes US-led coups, especially during the Cold War, was how the overthrow of these governments often stamped out new democracies, budding democratic movements, replacing them with authoritarian leaders who would go on to oppress the people with the support and backing\nof the United States, and in the process, redirecting\nthe country's history. Lately, Russia has been meddling in the election process of the United States, and I've been reflecting on\nmy feelings towards that. The violation of having an external power sowing doubt and polarization and fear in my own democracy, in my own society. It feels like such a violation, and it is. This is giving me just a tiny\ntaste of what it feels like to have an outside power pulling this strings in your country, tearing it apart for their own purposes, and in the process, creating\nmore problems for the people and for the United States itself, undermining any semblance\nof democracy or development, all in the name of keeping the US on top and dominant over the globe.

    "captions": "Saying that most of our ocean floor is unmapped\u00a0\nisn't entirely true. We do have maps created by\u00a0\u00a0 satellites that do all this fancy measuring\u00a0\nof differences in gravity caused by the ocean\u00a0\u00a0 floor's topography. *explosion sounds* But the\u00a0\nresolution of these maps isn't great. These\u00a0\u00a0 satellite maps only show features larger than\u00a0\nfive kilometers, which is like huge. Meanwhile,\u00a0\u00a0 our maps of friggin\u2019 Mars have a resolution of\u00a0\nlike six meters. So what's the benefit of having\u00a0\u00a0 a detailed map of our ocean? For starters, it's\u00a0\njust freakin\u2019 cool. But also the ocean is hugely\u00a0\u00a0 important to our survival. Aside from providing\u00a0\nme with delicious seafood, it's also the largest\u00a0\u00a0 carbon sink that we have on our planet. And it\u00a0\nhelps regulate all sorts of different things.\u00a0\u00a0 Like, I don't know, global temperatures might be\u00a0\nimportant. Not to mention we'll probably find new\u00a0\u00a0 resources that we can use, which actually\u00a0\nnow that I think about it could totally\u00a0\u00a0 backfire because humans kind of suck at finding\u00a0\nresources and not totally exploiting them beyond\u00a0\u00a0 repair. That being said, how do we even begin to\u00a0\nprotect something that we don't even know exists?"

    "title": "Why Is Our Ocean Mostly Unmapped?",
    "video_id": "fj-3VKWqMVY",
    "captions": "Quick reminder that we have more detailed maps\u00a0\nof the surface of Mars than the Earth's ocean\u00a0\u00a0 floor. In fact, there's a map for that. This is\u00a0\na map that highlights in dark blue what part of\u00a0\u00a0 the ocean floor is still unmapped. It also shows\u00a0\nthe percentage of unmapped territory on the shores\u00a0\u00a0 of different countries. Japan's doing pretty\u00a0\ngood. They've mapped most of their ocean floor,\u00a0\u00a0 while Thailand has barely mapped any of their\u00a0\nocean. And the U.S. still has about a third of\u00a0\u00a0 its oceans unmapped. The ocean makes up\u00a0\nlike 70% of the Earth's surface. So why\u00a0\u00a0 don't we have a good map of the majority\u00a0\nof our planet? It comes down to a lack of\u00a0\u00a0 will. It's not like it's crazy expensive. It\u00a0\nwould cost an estimated $3 billion to create\u00a0\u00a0 a detailed map of the entire ocean floor.\u00a0\nThat's like a rounding error for, like,\u00a0\u00a0 the US military or Jeff Bezos. NASA's spent around\u00a0\nthat much, $3 billion, to send the Perseverance\u00a0\u00a0 Rover to Mars, and billions more on previous Mars\u00a0\nmissions. Which, I get it. That's really useful,\u00a0\u00a0 fascinating stuff. But wouldn't it be equally\u00a0\nso to discover what our own planet looks like?"

    "video_id": "wQSxY7TR6mI",
    "captions": "(speech muffled by static) - [Pilot 3] Oh my gosh, dude. (suspenseful music) - [Johnny] It's November 14th, 2004, about a hundred miles off the coast of San Diego, California. The USS Nimitz, one of the US Navy's largest aircraft carriers is preparing for deployment to the Persian Gulf. But the radar technicians\naboard notice something weird. The military report from that day says that they notice quote, \"multiple objects descending from around 60,000 feet down to 50 feet in a matter of seconds.\" Very high velocity. 60,000 feet. A reminder that commercial airplanes fly at like 36,000 feet. The report goes on to say\nthat these objects quote, \"hover for a short time and\ndepart at super high velocities\" with, quote, \"advanced\nacceleration capabilities.\" At first, these radar techs thought that their fancy new radar\nsystem was messed up, so they recalibrated the\nradar, but the signal remained. Something was up here. - They're telling us they\nhave a contact on their radar. They don't know what it\nis. They just have a blip. Well, they've been watching these things, and what he told me is they had\nbeen looking at these things as we're driving. I says, sir, we've been\ntracking these things for about two weeks. That's, we had been at sea for two weeks. He goes, this is the first\ntime we've had planes airborne. We want you to go see what these are. - [Johnny] So they sent out\ntwo F/A-18s to investigate. The report from that day\ndescribes a day of blue skies, no clouds and unlimited visibility. These two Navy pilots arrive to the scene, each with a weapons officer in the back. They look around and\nnotice something strange in the water below. - So, as we're looking\ndown off the right side, the back seater in the\nairplane, Jim, he says, \"Hey, skipper, do you,\" and that's about what he gets\nout of his mouth and I go, \"What the hell is that?\" - [Johnny] It looks as if\nsome cross shaped object the size of a massive\nairplane is submerged right underneath the surface of the water, and above it, it appears to be boiling. And just above the boiling\nwater, an object is hovering. - And we saw this little\nwhite Tic Tac looking object, and it's just kind of moving\nabove the whitewater area. - Like no predictable movement,\nno predictable trajectory. - Yeah. - I guess it was just- - It was just like a ping pong ball. - No acceleration. - Very, very random. - Acceleration. - [Johnny] The Navy report\ndescribes this object as quote, \"an elongated egg or a Tic\nTac that was uniformly white across the entire body.\" It was approximately 46 feet in length. One of the pilots with his\nweapons officer in the back wanted to get a closer look. - So then I go, hey, I'm\ngonna go check it out. - [Johnny] So, he turns this\njet down towards the object. The other pilot's staying\nback to get a wider view. - So, I'm coming down, and\nas I get to 12 o'clock, as the Tic Tac's doing this,\nit literally, it's like it be, it's aware of us and it just goes bloop, and it kind of points out towards the west and starts coming up. So, now it's obviously\nknows that we're there, whatever this thing is,\nit knows that we're there. So, I'm kind of almost\ncoming out co altitude as this thing's coming up. I'm gonna meet it, and it just, as it crosses our nose, it just, it accelerates and literally,\nin less than, you know, probably less than a half second, it just goes, and it's gone. - And you saw no visible propulsion? - Right. - [Interviewer] No wings or anything- - No. - [Interviewer] To no make\nit fly in our atmosphere. - [Johnny] As these two\npilots are heading back to their aircraft carrier, they get a radio call from\none of their radar techs. - I mean, he's like, hey, sir, you're not gonna believe this, but that thing is at your cap. It showed back up. It just popped up. The other, this is like 60 miles away. It just reappears. - [Johnny] Within seconds, 60\nmiles away, just like that. By the time they get back to\nthe Nimitz, the object is gone. So, they gear up and get\nready to send another jet out to investigate, and this time, they make sure that an infrared camera is strapped to the bottom. With the camera recording, they found the Tic Tac again. Okay, so now we're looking at real data, real evidence that we can analyze, get us away from relying\non someone else's memory. What you're seeing is an object that is somehow flying through the sky. These infrared cameras will\nusually show a heat signature of exhaust or some kind\nof energy that shows how an aircraft is being\npropelled, something. But here, there's nothing. And yet suddenly, this\nobject in the blink of an eye blasts away. And to be clear, we just\nshowed you the raw clip. We didn't edit this in any way. This was back in 2004, but no one knew about it\nand likely never would until it was leaked in 2007\non a fringe UFO website called Above Top Secret. It honestly looked like some kind of BS conspiracy UFO stuff,\ntotally disregarded. But 10 years later, the Pentagon confirmed that, actually, it's totally legit. This is authentic Navy footage recorded by some of the best pilots on earth showing an unidentified flying object. \"The New York Times\" would go on to report on this pretty deeply and\nrevealed that this video, as well as the firsthand accounts by people who saw this object, would lead the Pentagon\nto create a secret program to study what's happening here. And not just this encounter,\nbut dozens of others. Something the public wouldn't\nhear about until recently. And that's what this video is about. - [Reporter] US military officials have gone before a Congress hearing, releasing once classified videos from fighter pilots' cockpits. - [Reporter 2] 144 unexplained sightings. (speech muffled by static) - Wait, pause. Yes, I know some of you are asking, am I actually doing this? Yes, I'm actually doing this. We're doing a deep dive on UFOs and no, it's not some bait and\nswitch storytelling device where I try to trick you into believing me and then, like, tell you to\nnot believe everything you see. I'm actually doing this. I'm applying my\njournalistic lens to a topic that, in my opinion, has\nbeen thoroughly bastardized and sensationalized by the\nlikes of the History Channel, UFO fanatics and Hollywood. I wanna do the opposite of all of that. I wanna actually evaluate\nthe facts, because, honestly, there are some really\ncompelling facts here. So this is not Roswell. It's not aliens landing\nat a school in Zimbabwe. It's not Bob Lazar claiming\nthat he worked on UFO tech back in the '70s. I'm not touching any of that stuff. Maybe if this video does well, I will open up those cans of worms. Today, all I'm looking\nat are the hundreds of evidence-based sightings of\nstuff flying around in the air that the US military has observed but has concluded they\ndon't know what it is. That's it. Let's do this. Oh, and by the way, next week's video is live\nright now over on Nebula. You can watch it ad free right this minute if you go sign up for Nebula. Link in the description,\nno code necessary. Okay, let's get back to it. In many ways, the 2004 Tic Tac\nevent is the starting point for a new era of UFO investigations. And again, big props\nto \"The New York Times\" for breaking the news that the Pentagon had been investigating UFOs in secret since at least 2007. It was a program that Harry Reid, a Democratic senator from Nevada, had personally been asking for. Big alien guy, that Harry Reid, huh? \"The Times\" reporting also revealed that there were other videos. In 2014, a Navy jet was chasing a fleet of strange objects on the east coast of the United States. I mean, listen to this radio chatter. - [Pilot] There's a whole\nfleet of them. Look on the ASA. - [Pilot 2] Oh my gosh. They're all going against the wind. The wind's 120 knots from the west. - [Pilot] Well if there's- - [Pilot 2] Look at that thing. - [Pilot] It's rotating. - The next year in the same area, a Navy pilot captured a small round object traveling at what looks\nlike very high speeds over the water. - [Pilot 3] Whoa! Got it. Woo hoo! What the fuck is that thing? - [Pilot 4] Did you box a moving target? - [Pilot 3] No, I took an auto-track. - [Pilot 4] Oh, okay. - [Pilot 3] Oh my gosh, dude. Wow. (speech muffled by static) - [Pilot 4] Look at that fly. - In 2019, some Navy sailors\nwere on board this destroyer when they pointed a camera through their night vision goggles\nand captured this video. On March 4th, 2019, a weapons officer sitting in the back of a fighter jet captured these pictures of\na quote, \"metallic blimp, a sphere and an acorn.\" And then, there was this incident in 2021 where a Navy pilot was filming\nout his window with a phone and caught this. Yeah, you probably missed it. Let's just slow that down. This. Like, what is this thing? These videos and images\nwere shot by Navy pilots who were on duty and have\nconfirmed to be authentic by the United States government. And these are just a few\nof hundreds of sightings under investigation by the Navy, many of which remained classified for, we all know what I'm gonna say, national security reasons. Not undermining it. I'm\njust saying like, ugh. It's just like the catchall\nfor all things I want to know. Got a little outta control there. (suspenseful music) As more and more of these\nunidentified flying objects were being reported and\ntalked about in the public, the Department of\nDefense finally assembled an official unidentified\naerial phenomenon task force. UAPs is what the government now calls UFOs because UFOs, you know, again, has been completely tainted by this stuff. - [Narrator] A UFO sighting\nover multiple cities. - [Speaker 2] I don't\nknow what the hell it is. - [Narrator] An extraterrestrial event that changed the course of history and an alien abduction witnessed\nby no less than six people. - When you read through these reports and you can start to see why the government wants to study this stuff. And no, it's not just\nbecause Harry Reid is, like, into aliens or whatever. The government says it itself that it's interested in this\nbecause of national security. Who's flying around in our airspace without our authorization, and why are they behaving in weird ways that we don't understand? But they also mention the\nsafety of their pilots and their very expensive hardware. This new committee has been\ncoming out with reports, and they state very clearly\nwhy they're doing this. First, the Pentagon is\nworried that these UAPs may be quote, \"part of a\nforeign collection program or indicative of a major\ntechnological advancement by a potential adversary.\" Counterintelligence, quote,\n\"UAP pose a hazard to safety of flight and could pose a broader danger if some instances represent\nsophisticated collection against United States military activities by foreign governments, or,\" crucially, \"demonstrate a\nbreakthrough aerospace technology by a potential adversary.\" Translation, we don't really\nknow what these things are and that kind of scares us. Oh, and safety. - When do you start getting a\nthought that, like, what is, what the fuck is this thing? - So, that happened when\nwe visually saw one. There were two aircraft\nfrom my squadron, VFA 11, and they flew, took\noff as a flight of two. That means they're essentially\nflying in a formation like this. And as they hit the area, one of these objects went\nright between the aircraft. - We have a very strict\nsystem for controlling who is flying in our airspace to make sure that things don't run into each other because random stuff flying around could risk the lives of the pilots and these $67 million weapons. So, when something like this\nhappens, it's a huge deal. They immediately abort\nwhatever they're doing, and they return to their ship to, like, discuss what the hell just happened. - And you know, he was\njust sitting there saying, \"Hey, you know, I almost hit\none of those damn things,\" and we all knew what he was referring to, even though we didn't\nnecessarily have a name for it just because we were seeing these so much. And he described it, you know. He described it just as a\nblack or dark gray cube. And that cube was inside of a\nclear or translucent sphere, and essentially the the apex\nwith the corners of that cube, best he could tell, were touching that inside of that sphere. - Wait, hold on. Did you catch that? Not the weird cube inside of a\ntranslucent sphere, whatever. We'll get to that later. To me, what's actually more compelling about what this guy just said is. - Because we were seeing these so much. - He is saying that these pilots have been seeing these things. - You know, essentially, all the time. - Wow. Yeah. Like yeah, I get it. The translucent cube thing\nis, like, more tantalizing, but, like, the fact\nthat these pilots report seeing these UAPs, these UFOs,\nall the time, day after day, week after week, that, to me,\nis more compelling evidence that we need to evaluate here. And, like the 2004 Tic Tac\ncase that we talked about at the beginning. - This was happening because\nwe upgraded our radar, the best we could tell. - These Navy personnel\nat first don't believe what they're seeing. They think that their\ninstruments are probably broken. - And then people started to\ntry to fly by it and see it. And at this point, you know, I would say maybe 80\nto 90% of our squadron had probably seen one of these\non the radar at this point. Everyone was aware of it. - So, according to some of these accounts, you've got a bunch of Navy\npilots seeing weird stuff all the time, both on radar but also with their infrared cameras. But are you gonna be the guy\nwho goes to your superior in the Navy and say, like,\nhey, I saw another UFO today. You don't wanna be like the UFO crazy. You're gonna get kicked\nout of the freaking, like, most superior pilot corps\nin the world because, like, you're seeing UFOs. These pilots have talked about\nhow there's a real stigma with reporting this stuff, so a lot of 'em just sort of keep quiet. But it was when that near\ncrash happened that now these pilots are literally\nrequired to file safety reports of what happened. And this is where the Pentagon\nand lawmakers who fund them were forced to take these\nUFOs more seriously. - We know that our service\nmembers have encountered unidentified aerial phenomenon, and because UAPs pose\npotential flight safety and general security risk, we are committed to a focused effort to determine their origins. - This is where I start\nto get pretty excited about the potential here because, look, this is like a real high up\nperson in our intel community in the military who's talking about getting more data on this, on studying it. Keep going. Mr. Moultrie. - Our effort will include\nthe thorough examination of adversarial platforms and potential breakthrough technologies, US government or commercial platforms, allied or partner systems\nand other natural phenomenon. - Scientists, military leaders, even some politicians\nare joining the crowd of true believers with the\nUS Navy task force called in. - So, by 2020 this is now,\nlike, becoming a thing, and this is probably why\nyou've heard about it recently. This task force was\nformed, and it represents the first time since 1969\nthat the US government has officially or at least\npublicly acknowledged the significance of studying UFOs. - There is something there, measurable by multiple instruments, and yet, it seems to move in directions that are inconsistent with\nwhat we know of physics or science more broadly. And that, to me, poses\nquestions of tremendous interest and, as well as potential\nnational security significance. - Okay, wait, pause, just, yep. Inconsistent with the\nlaws of physics. Yep. Very tantalizing. Let's just pause. We're talking about UFOs\nhere, and I feel obligated to just check in and make sure we're all\non the same page, okay? First, we know it is a\nfact that the US government has observed stuff in the\nair that they can't explain. The evidence that I've\npresented here is solid, solid sources, solid reporting. If I had evidence like\nthis for any other story that I'm doing, I'd be like,\nthis is solid evidence. Let's put it in the story. Okay? We know that it's true. (suspenseful music) Oh, and it's not just the few events that I've mentioned here. According to this report, there's been 144 of these instances either\nfrom the US military or government personnel, and 80 of these reports have been gathered from quote, \"multiple sensors,\" meaning from multiple perspectives, multiple perspectives or tools, which is like a thousand\ntimes better than, like, one pilot just saw something\nand is remembering it. Even if said pilot is someone like Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich, who, when you read this profile\nfrom \"The Washington Post\" on her, seems to be a pragmatic,\nhighly credible Navy pilot from one of the most\nspecialized flight programs in the world. - I don't identify as a UFO person. - Like, these pilots don't have incentives to make this stuff up. And yet, the fact remains\nthat their instruments for measuring and observing the world is the human eyes, brain\nand long-term memory, which is a pretty faulty and inaccurate data collection tool. So, when I see something\nlike 80 of these sightings being collected from multiple sensors, it makes all the difference for me. Okay, so that's number one. The US government has seen this. They don't know what it is,\nand it's been collected well. Number two, the other thing we know is that they've taken it seriously. This is a concern for them. The US Department of\nDefense is funding an effort to investigate, study and\nanalyze what is happening here, which, again, is awesome. Funding research is the only\nway that we know anything about the world. It's so much better than\nhearing a few people riff on what they saw. Science and research is our best antidote to the faulty, story driven human brain. And indeed, the task force has come to some pretty useful conclusions. - Since the release of\nthat preliminary report, UAP task force database\nhas now grown to contain approximately 400 reports. - They went back and they looked at every one of these reports, analyzed all the data they could. And when you do that, you\nstart to see these incidents come into perspective. Remember this video of the\nfast moving round thing that the pilot was freaking out about? Turns out that the Pentagon analyzed this, knowing everything they know\nabout where the jets were and what tools were being\nused to record this moment. And they calculated that\nthis was actually just, like, an optical illusion. Like, this object actually\nisn't moving that fast, only like 30 miles an hour. Or remember this video of\nthe triangles in the sky filmed off of that destroyer? It turns out that this was\nmore just quirky optics. - [Scott] We're now reasonably confident that these triangles correlate to unmanned aerial systems in the area. The triangular appearance\nis a result of light passing through the night vision goggles and then being recorded by an SLR camera. - These objects are\nprobably foreign drones trying to spy on US military maneuvers, yet they might not be triangle in shape, but, like, that's still\nreally useful information. We should know if there\nare foreign adversaries floating over our Navy destroyers. Or this video of a UFO shaped object being chased by an F-18. - [Pilot] There's a whole\nfleet of them. Look on the ASA. - What makes this video so weird is how the object is behaving, unexpected ways, kind\nof turning and rotating. - [Pilot 2] Look at that thing. - [Pilot] It's rotating. - Well, once again with\na little bit of analysis, this weird movement is\nactually just another quirk of the image sensors that\nthey use in the military on these specialized\ncameras that make objects look like they're moving in strange ways, when, really, if you just\nsaw it with your eye, it wouldn't be that weird. There's this guy, Mick West, who's probably the most\npassionate debunker of, like, anything weird going on here. He does a really compelling deep dive on an explanation for this, why this object looks like\nit's moving so strangely. I mean if you want to go into it, it's like another optical\nmixed with camera sensors mixed with gimbal equipment and rotating compensation mechanisms. Yeah, you get the point, but we still don't know\nwhat this object is, but at least we have more clarity on why it looks weird to us with our eyes when we're watching on\na video on the internet. The Pentagon recently came out\nand told \"The New York Times\" that most of this stuff is actually just foreign spies flying around, spying on US military\nactivities or weather balloons or other airborne tracks, and further specifying\nthat a lot of this stuff that looks weird to us looks weird because it was recorded\non gear that is classified and is built for a specific purpose that we don't have\naccess to understanding, leading to some strange looking imagery. Really convenient, Pentagon. And yet, another fact\nin all of this is that many of these videos have\nnot been officially declared a foreign drone and, in\nfact, remain unexplained. And that's after analysis. One of those unexplained\nsightings was this one from 2004, the one we started this video\non, the Tic Tac incident. (suspenseful music) The report often cites lack\nof good data and, indeed, what we have here is not the best, but we still have four sets of eyeballs. We have an official Navy\nreport gathering facts from that day, technicians seeing this thing\ndescend from 60,000 feet down to 50 feet in a matter of seconds, hovering stationary on the\nradar for a short amount of time and then departing at high\nvelocities, high turn rates. This video, which is kind\nof uninspiring and grainy and not very long, but\nstill shows us something, with its infrared not\ncapturing any heat signature, any means of propulsion\nas this thing flies around at mind boggling speeds. Since these pilots went\npublic with their account, a handful more of Navy\nwitnesses have come forward telling their stories\nof what they have seen. And again, I take this all\nwith a giant grain of salt, especially when you see\nsome of these accounts putting fuel on the fire\nin the form of crazy claims that, I'm intentionally not\ngonna go into into them here because I consider them\ndeeply outside of the realm of useful evidence. But yeah, if you're interested, you can easily go down the rabbit hole. This stuff is like\nclickbait for every human. If you do go down the rabbit hole on some of these other\ntestimonies or witnesses, just be careful. This is powerful, intoxicating stuff. We all secretly want to believe that this isn't just,\nlike, China spying on us. That's boring. Our brains are really good\nat filling in the gaps to construct a faulty narrative. Be careful. But yeah, that aside, there's\nstill no satisfying theories that I could find that\nexplain the 2004 Tic Tac case. Could be Russia or Chinese secret drones or even experimental aircraft that we ourselves have been developing. I mean, it's no secret\nthat powerful countries spend a lot of time and\nresources trying to get a leg up militarily, trying to find the next big technological thing. Like, you can actually find\npatents from the US military that claim to revolutionize\npropulsion tech using, like, anti-gravity\nspacecraft, like, really out there, wild,\nweird, theoretical tech that may or may not exist. Again, another rabbit hole\nI'm not gonna go down. The 2004 Tic Tac case remains a mystery, and I have a feeling that it\nwill be a mystery forever. We'll probably never\nknow what this thing is, and that's because real answers only come when you have real inquiry with real tools to measure and analyze real\ndata from the real world. People's eyes and brains and memories are about the worst\nthing you can count on, and yet, we can't ignore credible sources. - They were always out there, you know. - [Joe] Always. - They were out there when we took off. We'd see them and then we'd go to land. They would still be out there. - Like every day? - Every day. - But that's not proof of anything. To me, if they're always out there, we should be able to come\nup with a way to study them, and the US government agrees. - This often limited\namount of high quality data and reporting hampers our\nability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP. - Step one in all this is gonna be to decouple the study of UFOs, which is something we should totally do, from the quick conclusion\nthat people jump to that we are being visited by aliens from a different star system. That is what created the\nstigma in the first place. That is why people are embarrassed\nto talk about this stuff. We need to decouple them. There are UFOs. We should study them and\nsee what they actually are. But am I saying that\nthese absolutely aren't alien spacecraft coming\nfrom other planets? No, I'm not saying that\nat all. I don't know. What I'm saying is that I\nhaven't seen anything close to the burden of evidence\nrequired for me to believe that that's what these things are. What I have seen is evidence\nof weird, unidentified things flying around, behaving in\nways that are potentially beyond our mainstream\nunderstanding of physics. I mean, potentially. So yes, I'm totally open to\nthese things being aliens. I'm open to literally anything. My issue is that people see this, and our brains automatically\ndo the easy thing, which is to fill in the blanks. Suddenly, aliens are the\nexplanation. My brain does it, too. It scares me. It's not\nthe right approach here. I mean, I'm aware that it literally is almost a statistical impossibility that we're the only intelligent\nlife forms in this universe. Definitely not the the case. So yeah, maybe they found a way to travel to our little speck of dust planet, and they wanted to visit\nand look at us or something. I don't know. I'm totally open to it, but again, I have zero reason to believe that because there's no evidence that points to that as the explanation. - [Announcer] Seven, six, five. - But then there's the flip side, the juicier part of this for me, which is, who's to say we aren't the awe inspiring creatures ourselves? A hundred years ago, most people were still\nriding around on horses. They would've looked at our\nmodern world, all of this and thought that, certainly,\naliens had come to take over. Certainly, some crazy magician had come and reshaped the entire planet, and that's exactly what happened. Crazy scientific breakthroughs\nhappen all the time. I mean, just this year,\nthe Nobel Prize in physics went to a team of physicists\nlaying the foundation for quantum communication,\nlike real-time communication that essentially bypasses the\nclassical laws of physics. What I'm trying to say here\nis we don't need to treat UFOs like religion. We don't need to believe. Instead of cobbling\ntogether the scant evidence that we have to fit some\nnarrative that we want to believe, let's go out there and\ngather data and analyze it and build a body of knowledge about this. Let's poke at these\nphenomena and figure out what the hell is going on in our airspace, at the very least to keep us safe, but potentially so that we\ncan discover something new, something that we can\nobserve, measure, analyze and learn from. Wait, wait, wait, don't go yet. They released the report. The Pentagon released the report, like, right before we published this video. Like, we were waiting for\nthem to release the report, and then they didn't. So, we filmed the video and I cut my hair, and then they released the\nfreaking report about the update, the 2022 Annual Report on\nUnidentified Aerial Phenomena, UAP, baby. We've gone through this,\nand the update is that they're actually studying this stuff. This report goes through\nand shows a Pentagon that is very interested in doing more to gather data on this,\nwhich is really great news. There have been 366 new reports of UAP. They think that over\nhalf of them are, like, airborne clutter or drones\nor balloon like entities, but 171 of these reports\nremain totally unidentifiable. They don't know what they\nare, and they even mention that some of them continue\nto demonstrate quote, \"unusual flight characteristics.\" They even say that they're\ntalking to allies about this to try to get to the bottom\nof what these UAP are. So yeah, the report is out.\nI'll link it in the sources. It's a pretty good read\nif you're into this stuff. I want to tell you that next\nweek's video is live right now. You can watch it right this second. It's over on Nebula. I publish all of my videos a week early, and it's over on Nebula, no ads. The video is a map\nexplainer that goes over all of the major coups\nthat the US has committed over the years to, like, depose leaders and put in leaders that they like. Spoiler alert, there's\nbeen a bunch of 'em, and we mapped them. You can go watch that video\nright now, but it's not just me. All of my favorite creators are on Nebula, because it is a creator owned platform where we all publish our best stuff, not just our videos that we\nput here ad-free and early, but also originals, things that you can't find anywhere else, like RealLifeLore's \"Modern Conflicts\" or PolyMatter's \"China Actually.\" These are really cool series that you can't find anywhere else. Nebula is a giant repository\nof really amazing stuff. This video actually isn't\nsponsored by Nebula. The reason I'm plugging it right now is because I don't have\na sponsor for today. And I want to tell you that\nif you sign up for Nebula, not only do you get access\nto my videos a week early and ad free, as well as access to all this other amazing, exclusive content, but you're also directly\nsupporting our channel. It's four bucks a month\nor 40 bucks a year, which is like $3 and 33 cents a month, and a portion of your subscription\ngoes directly to funding the creation of more videos like this. This isn't some, like, venture\nbacked, like, tech company. This is a creator owned streaming platform that we're all building together, and you subscribing to it not\nonly gets you all these perks, but also helps support us. So, if that's interesting to\nyou, I really appreciate it. (playful music)"

They sneak\u00a0\u00a0 around the world's oceans being undetectable,\u00a0\nthey carry nuclear weapons... But one way that\u00a0\u00a0 adversaries try to find submarines is through\u00a0\nmagnets. Because submarines are giant hunks of\u00a0\u00a0 metal, you can fly one of these little airplanes\u00a0\nover the ocean looking for some magnetic field\u00a0\u00a0 coming from the sub. This is not good. Submarines\u00a0\nneed to stay stealthy. Oh, and did I mention that\u00a0\u00a0 there are these underwater mines that look like\u00a0\nthey should be in some video game? They respond\u00a0\u00a0 to magnetism. So if a submarine is sneaking in\u00a0\nits enemies waters and it floats next to one of\u00a0\u00a0 these mines, it could trip the mine if it's giving\u00a0\nout too much magnetism. So the Navy's solution?\u00a0\u00a0 The magnetism carwash.

    "captions": "- [Announcer] Enough nuclear\npower to destroy the human race several times over. - I need to show you a video\nthat is blowing my mind. You have the ocean just sitting\nthere being nice and calm, and then this pops out. Boom! It doesn't just pop out. It pops out for a second and looks like it's just\nabout to fall back down. And then... (laughs in awe) This is a rocket. Yes, A full blown rocket\nthat is headed for space. Oh, and I know this kind of looks small. It's not small. And where is this rocket\nbeing launched from? Are there underwater bases? Yes, they're called submarines. (tense music) Once it gets to the surface, it flies a thousand\nkilometers above Earth, literally into space. It starts looking at the stars to navigate and eventually falls back down to Earth, traveling up to like 12,000 kilometers to hit whatever target the people who launched it wanted it to. Like what have we created? - [Announcer] With such destructive power, it threatened the world. A deadly game of stealth. An undeniable strategic deterrent. Nuclear warheads that\ncan wipe out countries. - Submarines are fucking cool. I just gotta say it. They're these massive\nfloating nuclear weapons that could be anywhere at any time that we use for psychological\nwarfare and actual warfare and spying on people. And because of this, these giant vessels are actually incredibly stealthy. Like you could be swimming\nin the ocean one day, minding your own business,\nand right below you, there could literally be\nthis massive 48,000 ton metal machine with a couple\nhundred humans aboard equipped with nuclear warheads that could be launched\nat a moment's notice and you would've no idea\nbecause not being seen is kind of their whole MO, which is nuts because\nthese were some big boys. Like Russia's Typhoon class submarine. If you just pluck that out of the water and put it on land somewhere, you start to get a scale for\nhow massive this thing is. Like a floating building. Yeah, these guys are thick and they're cruising around our oceans 250 meters below the surface. Oh, and something we're\ngonna talk about later. They literally have nuclear\npower plants on board giving them basically unlimited energy to make fresh water and oxygen, which means they could be down here in the depths of the ocean for decades. That is, if there weren't humans aboard that needed to come up to eat food. Navies around the world\nwho have submarines do everything in their power to ensure that these subs\nare quiet and invisible, even magnet-resistant, all in the name of being undetectable. And they're always out there. Right now in this very moment, there are tons of these things. There are humans on these\nmulti-story buildings that are floating around our oceans with giant weapons in them. This is not normal. How did we get here? Why were these things invented? There's a lot to understand\nabout submarines. There's a lot of angles we have been researching for months and today we are going to\nshow you how we got here, what submarines can do,\nand most importantly, why. - One submarine has enough nuclear weapons to essentially end life on\nthe planet as we know it. Just one submarine. - An increase in submarine activity. - [Reporter] Russia re-arming their fleet, Chinese submarines, Iranian submarines. - [Reporter] They will preserve peace for many years to come. (tense music) - Boy, today's topic is so juicy and there is so much to get through. Nick, our studio manager,\nis building something for today's topic I wanna show you. But actually first, I\nwanna thank the people who made this possible, so thank you BetterHelp. I've become a massive\nproponent of therapy. I wasn't my whole life. It's only a couple years now\nthat I've been in therapy and it has truly changed my life. I am not saying that because BetterHelp is sponsoring today's video. I'm not saying that as an exaggeration. I'm saying that truly, literally therapy is a life-changing thing. Regardless of if you have a\nclinical mental health issue like depression or anxiety or like me, you don't have something clinical, but you're just a human\nwho lives in this world and has relationships\nand fears and stresses, therapy can truly give you tools to approach your life\nin a very different way. The big problem here is\nthat finding a therapist can be really difficult. It's often a matter of calling\nand going to waiting rooms and talking to insurance. BetterHelp changes the game on this. They're an online platform\nwhere you can go on, answer a few questions and\nthen based on your preferences, BetterHelp matches you with someone in their massive network\nof over 25,000 therapists. Oh, and if you don't\nwanna talk face to face with your therapist via like a video call, you can do text or a chat or a phone call. You get to make that decision based on what you need and what\nyour preferences are. If the therapist isn't a good fit for you, you can easily change and it\ndoesn't cost you anything. I think a lot of people don't get therapy because it's incredibly arduous and there's a lot of friction in finding a therapist and scheduling. BetterHelp solves this and makes therapy more\naccessible and affordable. And again, I'm a giant proponent of that. There's a link in my description. It's betterhelp.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gets you 10% off your first month of BetterHelp, so you can try it out at a discount and see if it's a good fit for you. Thank you BetterHelp for\nsupporting this video. Let's go check in on Nick. He's building something super cool. Okay, Nick, Nick, Nick,\nNick, what are you up to? Oh. - Yeah, it's coming together. [Johnny] Look at this model. Oh my God. - [Nick] That's the SSBN\nAndrew Jackson Lafayette class. As you can see, all the\npieces are out everywhere. - [Johnny] And these are the people. Look at the people, oh my God. - [Nick] You look up here in the front. These are the bunks. These are the torpedoes. - Okay, we will check\nin with Nick in a moment as that model gets built. Let me tell you how we got here. People have been building\nboats to try to go underwater for a very long time. Like look at this old art where you can see Alexander the Great going completely underwater\nin a big glass barrel. This was like 2,000 years ago. 1,800 years later, you\nhave Leonardo da Vinci who was busy literally thinking of anything that could be invented and he sketched up his very own version of an underwater boat, this beauty right here. It was basically like\na big mechanical fish. Oh, and this is wild. He kept these sketches a\nsecret because he feared quote, \"The evil nature of men\nwho practice assassination \"at the bottom of the sea.\" Like he thought that we might use these underwater boats for war. Whoops. Anyway, the first known boat\nto actually navigate underwater was of course built by a Dutch dude. The Dutch, man, they're\njust so good at water. 150 years later, over here in what was soon to be the United States, George Washington paid for this sucker to be made for his army. I mean, there could be a\nwhole video about this boat, the Turtle, because it kind of looked like two turtle shells put together. So cute. The guy in there is just like so cozy. They tried to use the Turtle in their war for freedom\nagainst the British, but it never really did anything useful and then it just sank. I mean cool name, but wasn't\na super useful submarine, but it paved the way. 50 years later, we have\nthe American Civil War where the Confederate rebels built a sub that was powered by a bunch of guys manually turning a crank and on board it had a long spar torpedo. Don't be fooled, though. Spar torpedo was just a fancy way of saying a bomb on a 15 foot stick, and they actually used it. They snuck up on a Yankee ship, underneath it with their bomb stick in the middle of the\nCivil War and blew it up and both sides sank, like\nthe submarines sank too. Like, it didn't work. I mean, it kind of worked,\nbut it didn't really work. Anyway, I had to mention all\nof these like early submarines because they kind of laid the groundwork. But in the 1800s, things\nget really serious thanks to this guy over here in Germany. Rudolf Diesel invented an\nengine that changed everything. This new engine mixed pressure\nand air and fossil fuels that all exploded and made things move. This changed a lot of industries, but the Germans were like let's put these in submarines and run them to charge\na bunch of batteries that we can use to power the\nsub while we're underwater. It's a lot better than the\nhand crank, and indeed it was. But there was one big problem, which is that this engine needs air, like it needs to be able to pump out the exhaust that it makes and it needs to be able to suck\nin air to like make energy. So you can't actually run\nyour engines underwater. So these German subs, as\nstealthy as they were, were still very limited because they could only stay underwater for like 48 hours max\nbefore having to come up and give away their position so that they could get\nair for their engines. This is a problem that\nwill soon be solved, but we just need a few wars first. It's the 1900s, we have\nall these big empires that are looking for ways\nto destroy themselves with their new industrial technology and they're getting good at submarines. They're loading them up with\nmore and more batteries. Now they have sonar and radar capabilities so that they can like see underwater and they have radios\nand encryption devices so they can talk to each other\nwhile they're underwater, which is everything when\nyou're fighting a war. The Germans call these these submarines untersee boats or U-boats and they use them for their new plan of unrestricted submarine warfare, which is a sterile way of just saying we feel comfortable sneaking\nup on civilian boats and sinking them and killing\nthe people without notice because we've decided\nwe are literal villains. - [Announcer] Submarines aim\nand fire their deadly torpedoes and all was over then in the sudden attack, in the face of enemy submarines. - So yeah, being used for horrible means, but let's be clear, this\nis amazing technology. Like this is light years ahead of the forefathers of\nsubmarines like the Turtle or that poorly thought\nout bomb on a stick thing from the Civil War, but they still have the limitation of air. They need to come up all the time to get air for their engines. No matter how scary and\nstealthy they could become and sneaking around\nunderwater during these wars, they still have to come up\nto the surface every 48 hours to run their engines and\nrecharge their batteries, giving away their sneaky position and becoming way less\neffective as a war tool. This would be like playing Battleship, but every few turns, you have\nto flip your board around to show your opponent\nwhere you are for a sec. They kind of figured this out a little bit when they started to use\nthese two little tubes that allowed them to kind\nof still be underwater, but to like put the tubes up and suck down air from the\nsurface, push out exhaust, but it was kind of rubbish. Like having to run your\nnoisy engines every 48 hours was a huge limitation on how\nuseful these subs could be. Well, of course, the war ends. Germany loses and surrenders and some of these U-boats\nthat were just sitting there were divvied up among the winners, the US, the UK and the USSR, who discovered that, wow, the Germans have some\namazing submarine tech. Let's use this tech to\npimp out our own subs, leapfrogging decades of development. And this is where things\nget juicy and scary. (tense music) So now you have these two former allies, the US and the Soviet Union looking at each other with skepticism. They both got their\nhands on this German tech and they both know that the other `got their hands on this German tech, and they both secretly are like, we need to get way better than\nthe other at submarine tech. Let's go. This was a huge priority, but it was also weird and hush hush. (sighs) The Cold War. This begins an era of secretive investment into submarine technology, and this is where they level\nup to blow all of our minds, where submarines become the impossibly advanced\nmachines that we know today. Something that changed everything here was that humans had learned\nto tinker with atoms, breaking them apart to make\nincredible amounts of energy, and they used that\nenergy to blow things up, but also to make electricity. And crucially, nuclear\nenergy didn't require air. So it's the 1950s and you got this guy. He's a Russian born American\nNavy guy named Hyman Rickover, and he was like, \"Whoa,\nwhoa, wait a second. \"You're telling me that\nyou can make electricity \"but you don't need air?\" Light bulbs going off on this guy's head because he's a submarine\nguy and he's like, \"Let's slap these puppies into submarines. \"That would solve all of our needing \"to come up to the surface\nevery couple of hours problem.\" The US government's like, \"Wait, sorry, what did you say, Rickover?\" And Rickover's like, \"I said let's put the nuclear power plant \"inside of the submarine. \"We gotta get ahead of the Soviets.\" He got a lot of pushback for\nthis for obvious reasons, but he dug his heels in, leapfrogging all the bosses till he got to the\nchief of Navy operations and whispered in his ear his\nbig idea and it totally worked. The story of how this went down is insane and Rickover was insane and visionary, and I'll leave some reading in the sources for those who want to go\ndown that rabbit hole. Whew. Showing a lot of discipline here, just like breezing over this guy's story. But yes, it's the 50s\nand the US government set about trying to put a\nfull-blown nuclear reactor, a power plant inside of\ntheir giant floating weapon and they did somehow and\nit changed everything. - [Announcer] Arrival of nuclear power has broken those bonds. - [Announcer] Can go around\nthe world on a core of uranium only slightly larger than a golf ball. - [Announcer] She may have\njust as profound an effect for naval strategy as the\nairplane has had on war. - Let's see how Nick's\ndoing with his model. Oh, here we go. Look at this big boy. - [Nick] Here she is. - [Johnny] Wow. (soft music) - Wow, I am going to put\nthis model on my desk and look at it every day\nbecause it's beautiful and it's like retro,\nwhich is kind of cool. Anyway, let's get back to the story here because the next chapter here is really the chapter that matters most. Once they got the nuclear\nreactor onto these subs, everything changed. I'm gonna show you why. (soft music) So look at this big old submarine. It's a Sturgeon class\nsubmarine from the 60s. It's a US Navy sub. And look, back here, we've\ngot the nuclear reactor. It sits back here doing its\nthing, breaking atoms apart, which produces an enormous amount of heat that can heat up water that\nturns this massive propeller, and remember that spinning things gives you power, electricity, boom. You're spinning turbines and now you have electricity\nfor your submarine. Not only does the nuclear\nreactor not need air to work, but it literally creates air. After all, it's surrounded by H20, so all it needs to do is\nbreak the two H's from the O and boom, you've got oxygen\nfor your crew to breathe. I mean this nuclear reactor was magic. Move over, trees, we've got submarines. And they use all of this abundant energy to get rid of salt in the water. So now the crew has like drinking\nwater and can take showers while they're floating hundreds\nof meters under the ocean. Like this is becoming really insane. The nuclear reactor\nsolved all the problems. Remember how diesel submarines\nhad to refuel all the time and they had to come up to the\nsurface to run their engines and get rid of their\nexhaust and suck in the air? Nuclear submarines\ncould now run underwater without needing to refuel for 20 years. Oh, that is if you don't count having to refuel the humans on board. So Rickover was right. Nuclear reactors on\nsubmarines changed everything. They are now way more useful. You can now sneak around the ocean and never give away your position. Okay, so now that we can be\nunderwater for basically ever, let's load these suckers\nup with big weapons. (mysterious music) These suckers are getting\nhuge by like the 70s and 80s. I mean, here was the German U-boat. Remember the one, like the thing that like really like\npushed it all forward? And here is an American\nCold War era submarine, the Ohio class. This thing is massive. Like zoom in here. Those are people, here's their kitchen. Here's the reactor back\nhere doing all of its magic. And look, here's where the crew sleeps. Oh, and what are they sleeping next to? What are all these tubes doing here? Oh, these tubes, kind of right\nwhere the crew is sleeping, yeah, these tubes are\nwhat make the submarine maybe the most important\nweapon to have ever existed. This is where the nukes are. (mysterious music) - Well, technically, we don't know that this is where the nukes are and any submariner will\nvehemently tell you that quote, \"We cannot confirm or deny whether or not \"the missiles inside of these\nsilos carry nuclear weapons.\" Wink, wink. This is where the nukes are. So what started as two superpowers nerding out about German\nsubmarine tech in the 40s turned into an arms race\nthat resulted in both of them figuring out how to power their\nsubs with nuclear reactors and the ability to load up\nthese subs with 24 rockets that they could launch to the\nedge of space at any moment carrying multiple nuclear warheads. Like having nuclear weapons\non land ready to fire is pretty cool. Having them on planes is pretty powerful. But you can see both of those things. When you have a sub quietly\nroving around the world's oceans with the ability to carry\na bunch of nuclear weapons and to launch them at any point, you've just achieved the\nmost powerful advantage in military strategy,\nsurprise, the panopticon. Your enemy has no idea where you are, but they know you are somewhere\nin range at all times, so they have to act as\nif you are everywhere, a few button presses away from launching one of these things. But this psychological sort of mind game only works if you are never noticed. So the next phase of this technological\nevolution of submarines focuses on silence. They start coating their\nsubmarines with rubber tiles so that the sonar doesn't\nbounce off as well. They took these giant propellers\nthat yes, are massive, bigger than you can imagine,\nand made them impossibly quiet. And even on the inside they started taking crazy precautions. Like all the heavy gear in a submarine is mounted on rubber pads\nto dampen any vibration that could be detected or heard. The cooks even started\nputting rubber on everything. Like their mixing bowls\nand their mixing spatulas are all like sound-deadening materials so that they don't send out\nvibration and make noise. The submarine force is\nserious about silence. In fact, they take pride\nin calling themselves the silent service and there's kind of a\nchip on their shoulder because they don't get\nnearly as much recognition as like these guys do. They're just like lurking\nin the depths of the ocean doing like a really\nimportant defense thing and no one knows about them because literally that's their\njob is to never be noticed. (sighs) Wow. So you have the US and the Soviet Union both with the ability to launch\nnukes from their submarines. And ironically, this whole everyone pointing a\ngun at each other thing actually keeps these great powers from ever fighting a war with each other. They were both too afraid\nof how easy it would be for the other to strike back\nwith their stealthy subs, ensuring the destruction of both sides. This is deterrence and it\nis one of the major forces keeping great powers from\ngoing to war with each other. It's why the US has an\nentire fleet of subs with no other mission\nthan to go into the ocean and just disappear and just sit there, silently ready to make\ngood on their threat that if you attack us, we\nare always ready to respond. Submarines are also\nreally good for spying. Okay, so we know by now that a lot of communication in this world is made possible because\nof underwater cables. It's not just the internet. These cables have existed\nfor a very long time and they're just sitting there\nat the bottom of the ocean connecting the whole\nworld and they're safe because no one has access to them. No one's gonna go to the\nvery bottom of the ocean. Oh wait, submarines. Submarines have unique\naccess to these cables. So it's the early 1970s and\nAmerican intelligence agencies team up with the Navy to have\nthem scour the ocean floor looking for Russian communication cables with the idea that they\ncould tap into the cables and listen to them. And lo and behold, they found one. 120 meters below the surface over in this eastern part of Russia, they found a cable that\nconnected to Soviet naval bases and they put a literal tape\nrecorder into the cable and now they're literally\nlistening to Soviets talking to each other about\nall sorts of military things. (voice speaking in Russian) None of it is encrypted in any way because no one expected them to dive down and find this cable. Oh, and they were really clever. They sort of only loosely\nattached it to the cable. In case they like needed to pull up the cable for\nmaintenance or something, the little device would fall\noff and no one would ever know that they were being spied on. But the tapes that were\nrecording like filled up, so divers had to go down and\nretrieve the recording device and take out the tapes\nand put in new tapes. And they did that like every month. And they were like we will\nnever get caught for this. But then eventually they did. It turns out that an NSA employee got paid $35,000 from the Soviets to tell them about this operation. Anyway, that would be an amazing movie. Someone please make that spy movie. The fact is that subs\nstill do a lot of spying. They will often have Navy Seals aboard that are ready to dive and\ndo dot, dot, dot, redacted. We have no idea, like we have literally\nno idea what they do for obvious reasons. There is evidence that\nthe US and UK spy agencies still tap into cables, like\nthe undersea fiber optic cables that like govern the internet and that they do this all the time. See Edward Snowden's big leak\nand some deep dive into that. I'm not gonna go into it, but\nwe know that submarines spy, we know that countries are\nalways spying on each other. This should not be surprising. In fact, during the\nresearch for this video, I felt the insatiable desire\nto dive down the rabbit hole of how submarines spy, and I didn't because I'm\ntrying to stay disciplined and I'm trying to tell this story, but leave a comment if you\nwant me to make that video and I will consider it 'cause there is a lot\nmore about that topic. Let's move on. (soft music) Okay, so let's get up to speed. Where are we today with submarines? According to the US Navy's website, the US has 71 submarines. 53 of them are fast attack subs and 14 are the ballistic missile subs that sit there and be our deterrent and four are guided missile subs. But then there's other sources that say that there's only 68 submarines. I don't know, all of\nthis is like classified and we're not supposed to know and no one's supposed to know, but we know a lot but not specifics. And like I mentioned, all of these subs have very\ndifferent capabilities. Fast attack subs, for example, are optimized for closer attacks. They use a lot of cruise missiles, which are launched through these big tubes and have jet engines and\ncomputer brains for navigation. They're way more precise, but they can still go pretty far. I mean, we're talking like\n2,400 kilometers away, 800 kilometers an hour, like they're still very, very\neffective long-term weapons. - [Reporter] Russia says it launched 26 cruise missiles today. 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles\nhave hit a Syrian airbase. Launching dozens of missiles\ntargeting the Syrian regimes. - But again, the one that like represents the mind-blowing reality of\nwhat we humans have invented is this sucker, the Ohio class submarine. They do have torpedoes and several other sort\nof smaller scale weapons, but it's these tubes that\nare carrying missiles which are carrying warheads that are the big defining game\nchanger of this technology. So let me just break down\nthe journey of these rockets. They can hit targets that are upwards of 6,400 kilometers away. That's like wider than\nthe entire United States and probably a lot longer, but of course, the Navy\nwon't tell us these things because it's all classified. And they don't just carry\nlike one nuclear warhead. They can carry multiple and they're not all\njust going to one place. They actually get dropped\nat different locations. How? An unbelievable amount\nof scientific ingenuity. Let me explain. It starts at the boost phase where the missile gets its initial umph, gets pushed out of the\nwater up into the air, goes up into the sky,\ngets a bunch of momentum, and then the engines cut and\nthe missile just has momentum and it starts to fly just\nusing the laws of physics, it's literally at the edge of space. We're now in the mid-course phase. The missile then just starts\ncasually looking at the stars to calibrate its position and then making little micro adjustments to make sure that it is perfectly\non course for its target. And this is where we need\nto talk about warheads. No, not, not those. These little cones that aren't\nthat little are warheads, the most powerful weapons\nhumans have ever created. These missiles can have up to 12 of these cone-shaped warheads. They're just hanging out on\nthe front tip of this rocket. Eventually this missile\nreaches its highest point and starts to come down. At this phase, the missile\nstarts spitting out the warheads just at the right time,\njust at the right velocity and as they reenter Earth's atmosphere, they start hurtling towards their targets as far as 1,500 kilometers apart. So like roughly the distance\nbetween Iceland and Norway. And then when they get where\nthey were programmed to go, I mean, you know what happens. (warhead explodes) Oh, but that happens potentially 12 times from this one rocket, each one of these explosions being roughly six times more powerful than\nthe bombs dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Okay, so that was one missile. This submarine can hold 24 missiles. Like what have we created? (rocket rumbling) Luckily since World War II, no one has had to use nuclear\nweapons in any conflict. We've had a lot of threats lately, but luckily they just\nremain a deterrent force and not an actual thing that we use. Hopefully it stays that way. And yes, several\ncountries have the ability to load these things onto\ntheir floating weapons called submarines that are lurking in the depths of the ocean at all times, spying and just sitting there. Okay, so that's submarines. Well, no, that's like a\nteaspoon of submarines. This topic could go on forever. I mean, seriously, I was- This was a painful story to do because there was so much I\nhad to leave on the table. I have a feeling that I'm gonna be making a few more videos about submarines soon. But let's just remember\nwhat we've learned here. We humans have invented\nsomething pretty wild, something that should be impossible. The ability for a bunch\nof us to live underwater in these floating buildings\nfor months at a time. We load these things up\nwith enough fire power to turn entire countries to dust, all in the name of never\nhaving to use them. That is the paradox of modern conflict. And yet, the thing I'm taking away from having spent a lot of\ntime thinking about submarines is that humans can kind of do whatever they put their minds to. Making power out of nuclear fission and putting that into\nan underwater weapon. Like what? Shooting rockets into space, having them look at the stars and then land wherever they want to? Humans did this. We did it because of fear\nand skepticism and conflict. We did this to get ahead,\nto be more powerful, but we did this. And that in some weird way gives me hope that someday when the\nbest minds aren't directed to the priorities of power and conflict, we humans will continue\nto make magic happen, magic that helps more and\nmore people live better lives, making impossible things possible. (soft music) (soft music) Thank you for watching\nmy video on submarines. What you're not looking at right now is all the props we have that were just sort of like in the background blurred\nout, but they're super cool. Hold on, look at this. This model of the USS West Virginia. You can see the little\nsilos up here for the nukes, all these guys. What I didn't tell you\nis that my father-in-law is actually the captain of a\nsubmarine, one of the SSBNs. So I had some major insider info that I've been learning\nabout for literally a decade and that helped spur this video on. I am getting more and more excited about the community we're\nbuilding over at the Newsroom. The Newsroom is what we call our Patreon. It just sounds way cooler\nto call it the Newsroom. We have a community of people that we ask for feedback on\nthings, for advice on things. We have live streams. I just did a live stream\nwith the community. It was really cool. You also get an extra video every month. It's a behind the scenes of vlog of how we make what we\nmake here in the studio. You'll meet the people, the team, you'll see the processes,\nyou'll see the shenanigans. It's a good time. And you also get the fuzzy feeling that you are supporting\nindependent journalism here on YouTube. So go check that out,\npatreon.com/johnnyharris. We have LUTs and presets which help you color\nyour videos and photos. We have a lot more videos. If you're new around here,\nsubscribe to the channel because we publish a lot lately. Like as the team has grown, we just publish tons of videos now, which is fun and kind\nof stressful sometimes. And we have, that's all we have. I've reached the end of\nwhat we have to give to you, and now I am done telling\nyou what I can give to you. What can you give to me? (snickers) Okay, I'm done. Bye, thank you, everyone.

This is a war that's being\nfought in government offices and company boardrooms. It's a war that's being fought\nwith rules and regulations and it's meant to stop rivals\nfrom getting their hands on the most important technology\nin the world, microchips. You might hear them called semiconductors, microchips, or integrated circuits. These are all the same thing. We're just gonna call\nthem chips, microchips, tiny pieces of metal that are\nmagic and that run our world. (upbeat music) This is a big thing that's happening in geopolitics right now and I wanna help you understand the stakes of this new conflict\nbetween the US and China. It's gonna be the center\nof global attention for years to come. What we're seeing right now is\nhow boring trade regulations and business rules can\nescalate to something that can impact your everyday life because your life depends on chips, whether you know it or not. In fact, let me show you. - Everything has silicon in it. Anything that has any\ntechnological smartness to it is a product of silicon. (upbeat music) - Sorry, Tom. (upbeat music) - Oh, and it's not just\nlike the usual suspects, techie things, yep, microchip. - My refrigerator, silicon,\nmy microwave, silicon. Nah, I'm just playing with you. This doesn't have silicon in it. (upbeat music) This is just a few little things\nI found around the office, but like silicon is in your\nrefrigerator, your microwave, like it is in your digital clock. It is what makes our world go round. I mean, we are speaking\nthrough silicon right now. Like you are watching this on the internet that is made possible because\nof silicon on a screen that is being fired by a silicon chip, like everything is silicon in our world, besides like the forest or\nsomething, or analog cameras. So microchips make our economy possible, but it's not just tech, it's\nnot just the consumer tech. It's also military, the\nmilitary needs microchips. (upbeat music) They need microchips for weapons systems. They need microchips for intelligence. They need microchips for AI. They need microchips to\nstay ahead of their rivals. Microchips represent geopolitical power because they represent military power. That's something to just\nkeep in mind as we go through this story. - House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi is in Taiwan tonight, China\nis already responding. - [Speaker] Lead the world\nin future industries, protect our national security. - We're in the middle of one of the most fundamental changes in the character of war,\nin the history of mankind. - Hey, pause. I feel really strongly that\nthe internet is a place where you can learn to level\nup your professional skills. I learned all my skills on the internet. That is how I know how to\nanimate and edit and film and do all of these things. The sponsor of today's\nvideo also believes this. Thank you Scaler for\nsponsoring today's video. Scaler is a place where you\ncan go and level up your skills as a programmer or engineer. Scaler is a short term\naccelerator program.

Let's dive back into microchips. (robotic noise) - In 1959, the US was\nabout to get very lucky. Computers at the time\nwere becoming a thing, but they kind of looked like this. Tons of wires connecting everything, all of them sending little\nprecise electronic signals to each other to solve\ntedious, complex math problems. It was clunky, it was inefficient, it wasn't very special yet. But then two American engineers\nthat were working separately at two totally different\ncompanies had a very similar idea. And the idea was to get rid\nof this, all these wires. There was this new technology\nthat had cropped up called a transistor. It was like a really precise,\nreliable on and off switch, allows you to control pulses\nof electricity super precisely. But at first transistors looked like this. They were big and clunky, lots of parts. So the idea was what if we\nstart carving these little on and off switches onto a\nmaterial called silicon. It's like a super abundant\nmetal like material inside of Earth's crust, but it's actually a horrible\nconductor of electricity. If you mix silicon with other elements, it conducts electricity really well. It is a semiconductor of electricity, exactly what they needed to\nprecisely control the flow of electricity very accurately,\nno more clunky long wires. Let's just carve our\nlittle transistor switches onto this silicon chip, a single circuit, that way we can fit a\nlot more into one place, all close together, so\nthat's what they did. And then the world changed forever. - [Narrator] With the\ntransistor, man has gone far toward matching some of the\ncapacity of the human brain. - Okay, real quick aside here, we're gonna get to the\ngeopolitics and stuff, but I was so curious about one thing. Why does being able to\nprecisely control the on and off switch or like\nthe flow of electricity, do anything to change the world? Well, it turns out, this is where my mind bends a little bit. Just stick with me here. So transistors can turn on\nand off and they send a signal that results in one of two\nthings, a one or a zero when it gets to the other side, super boring and useless if you just have one little transistor\nsending a one or a zero. But if you have a thousand\nof these switches, all sending little signals\nin the right order, suddenly you have something that kind of resembles a little brain, firing signals in a coordinated system that can actually solve\nlogical mathematical problems and literally remember things. This is kind of how our brain works. It's pulses, lots of pulses. And now we're talking about computing. This is how computers work. (upbeat music) - [Speaker] The first light. - The more pulses of\nelectricity you can control, the more you can do with technology. And suddenly there's a new\ngold rush in the United States, but the gold is now silicon. And the rush is to put as\nmany of these little switches onto that silicon chip as possible so that we can make our technology do more and more sophisticated stuff. And now people have smarter\nclocks and TVs and radios and video games and calculators, things that you can hold in\nyour hand and press a bunch of buttons and suddenly the silicon chip is solving math problems\nfor you instantaneously. What is happening? This is magic. Oh, and it's not just\ntech bros in the sixties who are loving this, the US military and NASA are first in line to get their hands on these new chips. They dream of using them for\nmore sophisticated weapons or going to the moon. Chips were becoming a\ncurrency for national power. We gotta protect them, thanks to the USA, luckily the USA didn't\nreally have to do much to protect them at first,\nthey were killing it. They were the global leaders\nof this chip making stuff. Every year US companies crammed\nmore and more transistors onto this little piece of silicon, more calculations per second. More and more companies\nare now cropping up to make dreams come true with\ntheir new magical microchips. Lots of this action was\nhappening right here in central California in a\nvalley that would soon take on the name of the material that enabled all this magic to happen. By the mid 1980s, they were carving nearly 300,000\nlittle on and off switches onto a piece of silicon. Oh, and look, it's Steve\nJobs and Bill Gates. - Yes.\n- They're using these more sophisticated silicon\nchips to change the course of history, home computing,\ncolor televisions, more advanced satellites, and smaller and smaller electronic\ndevices of all kinds. There's a revolution happening. And over the next 30 years, the number of transistors\nthat they can fit onto a piece of silicon starts to become ridiculous. And it's like the nineties and these things are\ngetting faster and smaller. And now humans have\ncomputers in their homes that are more advanced than\nthe ones that were used to land on the moon. - Not only do they play\nthe typical computer games that all the kids enjoy, but their curiosity for\nlearning has skyrocketed. - And look, it's even smaller\nnow, it fits in your pocket. And we are calling it iPhone. (crows cheers) - None of this is possible without these little magical\nbrains made of silicon. Okay, but then a problem arises\nand it has to do with these, these look like just factories where they make microchips, right? No, these are not just factories. We have a special name for these. They're called FABS and they're\na central part of this story because listen, cramming tens of millions\nof transistors onto a piece of metal-like substance\nfrom the earth is hard to begin with. But as the number of transistors continues to double and double and double, making them becomes\nincredibly complicated. I mean, look at these operations. This is inside of a FAB. And the reason why it looks like they're doing open\nheart surgery here is because even a single speck of\ndust that gets into this FAB and onto one of these\nchips can totally ruin it. So yeah, it was American companies\nwho are designing and making chips, but every year they have\nto spend more and more on these tedious FABS,\nthese factories on steroids. They're getting really spendy, like billions of dollars spendy. Meanwhile an ocean away, you've got a couple of economic\nmiracles happening in all of these countries in East Asia\nthat are rapidly developing and they want in on this\nmicrochip gold rush. (upbeat music) One of these countries is Japan, where a bunch of new tech\ncompanies were getting really good at making chips and they\ncould make them and sell them for way cheaper than the US. Oh, and by the way, this was with the help of\nthe Japanese government who's like subsidizing this,\ngovernments love microchips. That's gonna be a theme in this video. (upbeat music) The US is hating this. They're kind of freaking\nout that Japan is getting in on all the chip gold rush, they\ngotta do something about it. So it's 1987 and the US\ngovernment basically says, no more Japanese chips. They put a 100% tax on Japanese\nchips coming into the US, which not surprisingly just\ncrushes Japan's chip industry. Too bad, so sad, Japan, said\nthe President at the time who was, wait, what the\nhell, Ronald Reagan? The profit of free markets and free trade? Well, what's going on here? - Our aim is to increase\nour national wealth so all will have more. - Well, turns out that\nchips are really important, so important in fact that\nMr. free market economics abandoned his principles\nto protect American chips. This is a theme, we're\ngonna see a lot more of it. Okay, so let's move on. Meanwhile, another Asian economic miracle\ncountry is growing super fast and wants to get in on this,\nbut they also are looking over at Japan and they're like, we don't want the US\nto squash us for trying to compete with them. So if we can't beat 'em, let's join 'em. (upbeat music) Oh, and this is an really\nimportant foreshadow here. Taiwan is looking over here\nat their neighbor China, who's also getting really\nrich and more serious about making good on\ntheir lifelong promise to eventually invade Taiwan and quote, \"Reunite it with China.\" Kind of scary. So in the back of Taiwan's mind, they're also kind of looking\nfor a way to get the West to protect them, so they made a bet, a freaking brilliant bet that solved all their problems at once. At the time, a bunch of engineers in Taiwan\nwere actually leaving Taiwan to go to the US to go to a\nuniversity there and then to actually work for US companies in the cutting edge microchip economy, Texas Instruments, Intel. So the first thing the\nTaiwanese government does is lure them back, they\nguarantee them jobs. They pay for their travel costs, they give them tax breaks\nto create companies. Their goal is to create a\nSilicon Valley in Taiwan and it totally works, it's\nlike a reverse brain drain. Thousands of engineers returned\nto Taiwan to start companies and to help build the\nmicrochip industry in Taiwan. And one of those engineers is the one who actually changed the game,\nthis guy named Morris Chang, he had the best idea of all of them. He had seen that American\nchip makers were hating how much money they had\nto invest in these FABS, these really complicated\nfactories to make microchips. His idea was instead of trying to compete with the United States\nin the chip industry and get crushed like Japan\ndid, let's become their friend. Let's solve their problem. We won't design chips,\nwe won't make devices, we won't make the software. We will just make the chips themselves. We will become the masters of FABS, the tedious expensive job of getting more and more transistors\nonto a piece of silicon. So he starts a company called Taiwan's Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company, TSMC, super promising and creative name, Morris. And the government of\nTaiwan is super into it because now they can get\nin on the chip gold rush and instead of pissing\noff the United States, they actually will solve the\nUS' problem and crucially, make the US reliant on them,\nso now they have protection, a silicon shield to protect them from their big aggressive neighbor. The government gave nearly\nhalf of the startup cost to Morris Chang to start this new venture. They connected him to venture capital and according to Chang himself, the Prime Minister of Taiwan even called a super rich Taiwanese\ninvestor to force him to invest in TSMC. Whoa, okay, yeah, wow. Like you can see just how vital chips are, a little piece of silicon with a bunch of on and off switches. TSMC was basically a state-owned\ncompany from the beginning. So yeah, Taiwan's now in the\ngame and semiconductors are now becoming a geopolitical\nbargaining chip, chip, a geopolitical bargaining chip. I kind of regret it, sorry. (upbeat music) - Go in here. - I believe I'm going to be the nominee. - So it's like the early 2000s and semiconductors are now\nsquarely a part of geopolitics. But meanwhile, in business\nworld in Silicon Valley, they're loving this Taiwan\nsituation because now instead of having to do all of this\nexpensive, tedious FAB stuff, they can just do the\ndesign and the software and the business side of it\nand they can just ship it off to TSMC and they do the rest,\ntaking on the expensive, tedious work of maintaining\ntheir FABS and keeping them up to the cutting edge, which requires billions\nof dollars every year. Like to keep some perspective,\nlook at this graph. This is the number of transistors\non a piece of silicon. By 2010, they're now getting a billion\ntransistors onto a piece of silicon the size of your fingernail. And the only way to do\nthat is to make each one of these insanely small. So let's just take a moment\nto blow our own minds here. Each transistor is becoming\nsmaller than a width of a human hair, wait, no, sorry, that's actually way too big of a scale. A human hair is like\n90,000 nanometers thick. We need to go smaller\nlike a red blood cell. Wait, no, that's still too big. 7,000 nanometers, okay, a virus, something that's not even\ntotally alive, it's so small. Wait, that's 14 nanometers, still too big. I mean we are getting\ninto insane scales here. IBM recently revealed the chip with transistors that\nare two nanometers thick, making them literally\nsmaller than a strand of DNA. So in these FABS, the reason it looks like\nthis is because they have to figure out how to do\nthis and to keep doing it and keep making it smaller and smaller, providing the world with\nthe most advanced chips. And this is why we have nice things. Your entire world revolves\naround what is happening on these little strips of silicon. (upbeat music) - But more and more US chip companies don't actually have FABS. They design them, they do all the software and\nthe machinery and the selling and the business, but the actual making of\nthe chip happened in Taiwan. But as 92% of all advanced\nchips are now made in Taiwan, what this means is that the\nUS is completely reliant on TSMC basically. And finally, we're\ngetting to the conflict. This is where China becomes\nreally important because China, the most populous country\nis suddenly very rich and they want new tech too. So they become actually a giant\ncustomer of all these chips, buying 40% of all the chips in the world, meaning that they are\nnow reliant on the US, who is reliant on Taiwan to\ndesign and make their chips. So let's look at the modern chip industry as it all comes together,\nwhich is gonna set the stage for how this conflict\nis playing out today. Here's a very simplified\nversion of the supply chain. Again, very simplified, it's just insane. I'm not gonna go into the full thing. The US is the one that\nmanufactures the machines, the software, and the designs. Japan makes metals and\nchemicals for chips. The Netherlands makes this\ncrazy UV laser machine that is used to carve the chips. And Taiwan crucially does\nthe expensive tedious job of actually making the chips. Almost all of the most advanced\nchips in the world are made in Taiwan. And then you have China, who is the giant customer in all of this. They're the ones who are\nbuying more and more chips to grow their economy. I mean, look at this\nbeautiful supply chain. You've got a bunch of countries\nthat are involved now, everyone has a part to\nplay and everyone depends on each other for chips. Globalization is great. Economic interdependence is a recipe for peace and mutual prosperity, right? I mean it used to be. But there's something else\nhappening with the supply chain that might be hard to see in this diagram, which is that the US is still\nthe kingpin of this system. They're the most important player. They have the most important\ningredients, the best designs, the best software, and the\nmost machines to make chips. Taiwan, their bestie, has the second most important\ningredients in all of this, the FABS that actually make the chips. China on the other hand is\nin a position of weakness. Their role is basically the\nbig hungry chip consumer, totally reliant on their frenemy, the United States and their\nannoying neighbor, Taiwan, who they want to invade, but now they're reliant\non for cutting edge chips. And what's at stake here for China? Well, it's not just their economy. They don't want chips just\nso they can have a bunch of cool tech. They want it because more and more, they need advanced chips\nfor their military. (upbeat music) It's like the 2010s, China's military is getting kind of scary, but it's not that scary says\nthe IS, we're not that worried. We'll always be ahead\nof China when it comes to controlling the supply chain. And our military gets first\ndibs on all the best chips. China has no chance of catching up ever. And this is true, China was truly behind. They did not have the tech and\nthe designs and the companies and the ability to make advanced chips. They were reliant on the United States. If China pissed off the US, they could just take away their chips. And now we have a rising\nconflict on our hands. (upbeat music) China, this big superpower\nis not gonna let this happen. They realize that they\nhave to do two things. Number one, they have to\nstart making their own chips. They wanna break free and\nstop relying on the US for anything, make their own chips so that\nthe US doesn't have leverage over them. And number two and deeply\nrelated is they want to continue to build up their\nmilitary, to modernize it, to build more war ships and satellites and high tech missiles and\ndrones and eventually AI. All of this needs advanced\nchips, which they don't have. So they're like, we are\ngonna make them on our own. And the US is like, good luck\nChina, you're so far behind. Good luck trying to figure\nout how to do this thing that we've spent the past 60\nyears figuring out how to do, make really expensive chips. Experts in software and\nmachinery and FABS like, you have no chance. So how is China gonna catch up? Lucky for them, in China, there's a blurry line between\nbusinesses and the military. It's all kind of overseen by the state and also lucky for them, there are loads of US tech\ncompanies that are addicted to making money by selling\nmicrochip technology to China. So instead of invent it themselves, they see an opportunity here. Need software and equipment\nfor your new chip industry? Get it from the US. Need fancy chip designs and software? US companies have you covered. Need those high-tech chips produced for your military projects? American companies will sell them to you. And yes, TSMC in Taiwan\nwill make them for you. Wait, China's using US\ntechnology to get ahead of US technology, what? In 2021, the Washington Post reported that China was building\nsuper advanced laboratories to test scary new weapons including nukes. And guess what? They were using American\nsemiconductor tech to do this. It started to become clear\nthat American companies were selling tech and chips and software to Chinese tech companies that\nwere actually just a front for the military. Wow, yikes. The US chip industry is now\nallowing China to get ahead. This was starting to happen, but I think what really woke up the US is when this happened. - [Narrator] Huge step\nforward in China's military. China conducted two tests of a hypersonic missile system, technology that would allow it to fire a nuclear warhead\nfaster than anyone else. - The US does not\ncurrently have the ability to even track this weapon,\nmuch less defeat it. - US military generals wake up one morning to discover that China has\njust tested a new weapon, a missile that flew\naround the entire world, going five times the speed\nof sound, a mile a second. Oh, and it's really hard to see because it flies below radar range. It's super nimble, maneuverable, and has the ability to carry nukes. The US had been working\non something similar, but China beat them to it by years and it was American microchip technology that helped them build it. Oh shit. Yikes. This totally caught them off guard. - [Narrator] Says that US\nintelligence services had no idea that China was so far ahead. - So turns out that while\nthe US government thought that they were running faster\nand that they were fine, they were actually fueling the\nrise of their biggest rival by giving them the technology\nthat they need to get ahead. So the US decides that\nthey've gotta do something. China is ahead on these missiles\nand they might get ahead on things like AI and they're\ndoing it with our tech. No more free trade, no more free markets. The government is jumping\nback into the chip game to sort this out. - Fundamental change\nis taking place today, politically, economically,\nand technologically. - All right, Joe Biden's\nlike rolling up his sleeves. He's like, what do we do here? Step one, cut 'em off,\nno more chips for China. - The Biden administration\npublished a large set of export controls on Friday in order to slow Beijing's technological\nand military advances. - [Speaker] Restrictions will\nlimit Chinese companies access to advanced computer chip. - And here we are, back in the\nfun, bureaucratic paperwork, Department of Commerce, Bureau\nof Industry and Security, docket number 220930-0204RIN0674... \"Certain advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing\nitems, supercomputers, and semiconductor end use,\nentity list modification.\" We're not gonna go through this. This is just a bunch of rules that says no more chips to China. All those cutting edge\nchips that China was buying from US companies, blocked. - [Speaker] The restrictions\nwill limit Chinese companies access to advanced computer chips. - [Speaker] Manufacturing\nequipment they need to make their own chips? Blocked. All that US made vital software\nthat Chinese companies need to design their own chips? Blocked, blocked, blocked. - We will bring these\njobs back to our shores and end our dependence on foreign chips. - All right. - In fact, the Biden administration\nwent super far to say that any company globally\nthat uses US tech to produce chips is now\nblocked from doing business with Chinese firms. - [Speaker] To cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US equipment. - Why stop there? Americans are now forbidden from working for Chinese chip companies,\nthis is huge news. Like this is huge news, this is happening. This is like we're in the\nmiddle of this right now. But let's go back to that visual\nof the whole supply chain. If you cut off this, then\nyeah, you hurt China, but you also hurt the\nother side of this line, US chip makers. Like one example, this\nUS chipmaker, Nvidia, they went from selling\ntons of chips to China to suddenly being banned from doing so. This has led to a $400\nmillion loss in revenue in just one quarter. Poof, up in smoke. One of the biggest chip\nmakers now totally cut off from their big customer\nbecause Joe Biden is afraid of the Chinese military\nand for good reason, which leads to step two of this policy. The Biden administration\nwasn't gonna leave these tech companies out dry. So they gave billions of\ndollars to American chip makers to say, \"Hey, yes, sorry we cut you off from your main customer because\nwe're kind of getting scared of their military, but we have to protect our\nchips, here's a bunch of money.\" Congress passed the CHIPS Act, which gives billions of\ndollars to these companies to create FABS back in the United States. - This time it wasn't Russia\nbut China, another rival power would get way ahead of us if we didn't pull out all the stops. And this legislation\nis the first large step in pulling out all of those stops. - Government wants the\nFABS to come home to ensure that this most valuable\ntechnology isn't solely reliant on outside countries and\nwe're talking giant payouts. 50 billion taxpayer dollars\ngo to companies like Intel, which is now opening a new FAB in Ohio. - We are gonna build the most\nadvanced stuff in the world, right here in Ohio. - Or even TSMC themselves,\nwhich is based in Taiwan, but is now opening a new FAB in Arizona. Keep it in the family. Okay, so this is economic war\nand the Biden administration just did a huge move. Reminder that the reason\nwhy this is important is because it's not just about\nlike business or even missiles. This is about chips. Chips are not just chips,\nchips are the future. Chips are power. Yes, chips mean economic\ngrowth and new cool technology, but chips also mean new weapons. Chips are the currency\nof geopolitical power, kind of like what oil used to be, but now it's freaking silicon with a bunch of on and off switches on it. The US is taking control\nof its valuable resource and cutting China off. So the US makes this big\nmove, cuts China off, and this is geopolitical conflict. They just made the move, the\nball's in China's court now. How will they respond? And this is where Taiwan\ncomes back into the picture. (upbeat music) Taiwan is this small\ncountry that finds itself in the crossfires of this conflict. 92% of all advanced chips\nare made here mostly by TSMC. The US is totally reliant on them. A few months before the Biden\nadministration was doing all of this, making it illegal\nto sell chips to China, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, not just to like shake hands\nwith political leaders, no, she was there to visit TSMC, the chip FAB. What Pelosi was really doing\nhere was signaling to Taiwan that they are vital to American security. US relies on this and will protect it. - Came to Taiwan to make\nunequivocally clear, we'll not abandon our commitment\nto Taiwan and we are proud of our enduring friendship. - And in doing so, she shows us what China's\ncounter move might be in all of this, it might be Taiwan. - Are you willing to\nget involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that? - Yes, that's a commitment we made. - Okay, but wait, what this doesn't mean is like\nChina's gonna invade Taiwan and like take all the chips\nor like take over the FAB or something, that that\nscenario doesn't make any sense. If China invaded Taiwan, all they would find is\na bunch of empty FABS if they weren't bombed already. They wouldn't know how to operate them. They wouldn't have all of the\nengineers and the software and all of the supply chain\nstuff that they would need to actually make chips. They would likely be fighting a war and the US would probably get involved. I made a whole video about\nit, you can go check it out. Anyway, the effective counter move\nhere for China would be to operate right on the\nedge of active warfare to strike back at the US without provoking a military response. This is how big nuclear powers do it. They don't actually clash. They want to just sort\nof poke at each other. One scenario would be\nChina sending a bunch of its navy ships to set up in\nthe ocean right around here, creating a kind of partial blockade. They could stop cargo\nships that are coming to and from the island, kind of just slowing everything down, but really holding the silicon hostage, making it hard for the supply\nchain to actually work. I mean just remember like\nthe Covid 19 chip shortage or like supply chain shortage or even like the Suez Canal blockage from a couple years ago. Imagine those supply chain\nissues, but like on steroids, totally debilitating and being\nused for a hostile purpose to strike back at the US. Like Biden forbidding American companies to sell chips to China, the blockade would be a way to strike at your nuclear armed rival\nwithout going too far, without risking too much\nescalation or a miscalculation. - [Speaker] It's incumbent\nupon us to stay number one. - [Speaker] To lead the\nworld in future industries, protect our national security. - [Speaker] We are gonna build the most advanced stuff in the world. - That's where we're at. We're in the middle of\nanother economic war between big nuclear powers. We don't know what happens next, but one thing that feels clear\nto me is that Cold War vibes are back as these two great\npowers with different ideologies about the world compete with each other. This fight over chips will continue. And this idea in international\nrelations that I kind of took for granted, which is that like globalization\nand interdependence is good and will lead to less conflict, it's being seriously challenged. Economic interdependence\nis being used as a weapon. That's what we're seeing\nhere and not just here. I made a video a couple months ago about how Vladimir Putin\nis cutting off natural gas to Europe, frankly, it's not that much different\nthan Joe Biden cutting off microchips to China. I mean it is different in a\nlot of ways, blah, blah, blah, we get it. But like the the big mechanics of how this conflict is playing out, it's peculiar and and is becoming a part of how conflict looks today. So even as this old\nschool style war continues to rage in Ukraine, we're seeing an evolution\nof how conflict works in our world. Where once a lot of conflict revolved around natural resources\nlike oil, most recently, the currency of power. We've moved to an era\nwhere a magical piece of metal-like substance called silicon, pulsing ones and zeros, is kind of the new oil,\nthe new currency of power, the new thing that we should protect to protect our military supremacy. So in a big shift of the\ntrend of globalization, countries are now turning\ninward to protect their stuff, leading to a new era of\ndistrust, severed connection, and rising tensions. Okay. Okay, okay, semiconductors is over. That's it, I'm now going to\neat a Reese's peanut buttercup from Trader Joe's. Mm, wow that's good. I love this thing. Okay, that's the end of the video. Thanks to Scaler one more time\nfor sponsoring this video. There's link in the\ndescription that gets you on a free class if you wanna try that out. I have a couple things\nI wanna tell you about. Thanks for watching. I like to speak into a\nmicrophone at the end because it makes me feel\nlike I'm a podcaster. Should I start a podcast? People are asking me to start a podcast. What should I talk about on my podcast? Anyway, thanks for watching everyone. So we should probably\ntalk about the Newsroom. So we make a video, an\nextra video every month. It's a behind the scenes\nvlog where we like capture how all of this is made,\nthere's a big team of people, lots of cool fun personalities, lots of very skilled people\nwho touch these videos. I'm just like one cog in the machine. That video goes live every\nmonth and it's available to people who are members of the Newsroom, which is what we call our Patreon. I just like to call it the\nNewsroom 'cause it's like cooler. On the Newsroom, you also\nget access to my scripts, which are like big things that if maybe if you're like a journalist\nor a video storyteller, could be useful for you. You also get access to Tom Fox tracks. Tom Fox is our composer. You get royalty free music\nthat you can use in your videos if you are a member of the Newsroom and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting independent journalism. So the newsroom is over on\npatreon.com/JohnnyHarris. Another thing that I should\nmention is that we have LUTs and presets, which are like\na thing that you can buy and then you can color\nyour video or your photos in the way that we color it. We worked with the professional colorist to develop these things. They're basically presets and\nthey are for photo and video and they look really nice\nbecause I like things to look nice. And welcome to all the\nnew subscribers here. There's been a lot of new people\naround the channel lately, and it's fun to have this community grow. So I'm gonna keep telling\nstories and being curious and learning and looking\nfor evidence and data and questioning my assumptions and I appreciate you all being here. So I'll see you in the next one, bye. (upbeat music)"

This is a war that's being\nfought in government offices and company boardrooms. It's a war that's being fought\nwith rules and regulations and it's meant to stop rivals\nfrom getting their hands on the most important technology\nin the world, microchips. You might hear them called semiconductors, microchips, or integrated circuits. These are all the same thing. We're just gonna call\nthem chips, microchips, tiny pieces of metal that are\nmagic and that run our world. (upbeat music) This is a big thing that's happening in geopolitics right now and I wanna help you understand the stakes of this new conflict\nbetween the US and China. It's gonna be the center\nof global attention for years to come. What we're seeing right now is\nhow boring trade regulations and business rules can\nescalate to something that can impact your everyday life because your life depends on chips, whether you know it or not. In fact, let me show you. - Everything has silicon in it. Anything that has any\ntechnological smartness to it is a product of silicon. (upbeat music) - Sorry, Tom. (upbeat music) - Oh, and it's not just\nlike the usual suspects, techie things, yep, microchip. - My refrigerator, silicon,\nmy microwave, silicon. Nah, I'm just playing with you. This doesn't have silicon in it. (upbeat music) This is just a few little things\nI found around the office, but like silicon is in your\nrefrigerator, your microwave, like it is in your digital clock. It is what makes our world go round. I mean, we are speaking\nthrough silicon right now. Like you are watching this on the internet that is made possible because\nof silicon on a screen that is being fired by a silicon chip, like everything is silicon in our world, besides like the forest or\nsomething, or analog cameras. So microchips make our economy possible, but it's not just tech, it's\nnot just the consumer tech. It's also military, the\nmilitary needs microchips. (upbeat music) They need microchips for weapons systems. They need microchips for intelligence. They need microchips for AI. They need microchips to\nstay ahead of their rivals. Microchips represent geopolitical power because they represent military power. That's something to just\nkeep in mind as we go through this story. - House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi is in Taiwan tonight, China\nis already responding. - [Speaker] Lead the world\nin future industries, protect our national security. - We're in the middle of one of the most fundamental changes in the character of war,\nin the history of mankind. - Hey, pause. I feel really strongly that\nthe internet is a place where you can learn to level\nup your professional skills. I learned all my skills on the internet. That is how I know how to\nanimate and edit and film and do all of these things. The sponsor of today's\nvideo also believes this. Thank you Scaler for\nsponsoring today's video. Scaler is a place where you\ncan go and level up your skills as a programmer or engineer. Scaler is a short term\naccelerator program. It's like eight to 11\nmonths and it's meant to enhance the coding skills\nof software professionals, basically make you way\nbetter at your job and then to help you get a better job.

Let's dive back into microchips. (robotic noise) - In 1959, the US was\nabout to get very lucky. Computers at the time\nwere becoming a thing, but they kind of looked like this. Tons of wires connecting everything, all of them sending little\nprecise electronic signals to each other to solve\ntedious, complex math problems. It was clunky, it was inefficient, it wasn't very special yet. But then two American engineers\nthat were working separately at two totally different\ncompanies had a very similar idea. And the idea was to get rid\nof this, all these wires. There was this new technology\nthat had cropped up called a transistor. It was like a really precise,\nreliable on and off switch, allows you to control pulses\nof electricity super precisely. But at first transistors looked like this. They were big and clunky, lots of parts. So the idea was what if we\nstart carving these little on and off switches onto a\nmaterial called silicon. It's like a super abundant\nmetal like material inside of Earth's crust, but it's actually a horrible\nconductor of electricity. If you mix silicon with other elements, it conducts electricity really well. It is a semiconductor of electricity, exactly what they needed to\nprecisely control the flow of electricity very accurately,\nno more clunky long wires. Let's just carve our\nlittle transistor switches onto this silicon chip, a single circuit, that way we can fit a\nlot more into one place, all close together, so\nthat's what they did. And then the world changed forever. - [Narrator] With the\ntransistor, man has gone far toward matching some of the\ncapacity of the human brain. - Okay, real quick aside here, we're gonna get to the\ngeopolitics and stuff, but I was so curious about one thing. Why does being able to\nprecisely control the on and off switch or like\nthe flow of electricity, do anything to change the world? Well, it turns out, this is where my mind bends a little bit. Just stick with me here. So transistors can turn on\nand off and they send a signal that results in one of two\nthings, a one or a zero when it gets to the other side, super boring and useless if you just have one little transistor\nsending a one or a zero. But if you have a thousand\nof these switches, all sending little signals\nin the right order, suddenly you have something that kind of resembles a little brain, firing signals in a coordinated system that can actually solve\nlogical mathematical problems and literally remember things. This is kind of how our brain works. It's pulses, lots of pulses. And now we're talking about computing. This is how computers work. (upbeat music) - [Speaker] The first light. - The more pulses of\nelectricity you can control, the more you can do with technology. And suddenly there's a new\ngold rush in the United States, but the gold is now silicon. And the rush is to put as\nmany of these little switches onto that silicon chip as possible so that we can make our technology do more and more sophisticated stuff. And now people have smarter\nclocks and TVs and radios and video games and calculators, things that you can hold in\nyour hand and press a bunch of buttons and suddenly the silicon chip is solving math problems\nfor you instantaneously. What is happening? This is magic. Oh, and it's not just\ntech bros in the sixties who are loving this, the US military and NASA are first in line to get their hands on these new chips. They dream of using them for\nmore sophisticated weapons or going to the moon. Chips were becoming a\ncurrency for national power. We gotta protect them, thanks to the USA, luckily the USA didn't\nreally have to do much to protect them at first,\nthey were killing it. They were the global leaders\nof this chip making stuff. Every year US companies crammed\nmore and more transistors onto this little piece of silicon, more calculations per second. More and more companies\nare now cropping up to make dreams come true with\ntheir new magical microchips. Lots of this action was\nhappening right here in central California in a\nvalley that would soon take on the name of the material that enabled all this magic to happen. By the mid 1980s, they were carving nearly 300,000\nlittle on and off switches onto a piece of silicon. Oh, and look, it's Steve\nJobs and Bill Gates. - Yes.\n- They're using these more sophisticated silicon\nchips to change the course of history, home computing,\ncolor televisions, more advanced satellites, and smaller and smaller electronic\ndevices of all kinds. There's a revolution happening. And over the next 30 years, the number of transistors\nthat they can fit onto a piece of silicon starts to become ridiculous. And it's like the nineties and these things are\ngetting faster and smaller. And now humans have\ncomputers in their homes that are more advanced than\nthe ones that were used to land on the moon. - Not only do they play\nthe typical computer games that all the kids enjoy, but their curiosity for\nlearning has skyrocketed. - And look, it's even smaller\nnow, it fits in your pocket. And we are calling it iPhone. (crows cheers) - None of this is possible without these little magical\nbrains made of silicon. Okay, but then a problem arises\nand it has to do with these, these look like just factories where they make microchips, right? No, these are not just factories. We have a special name for these. They're called FABS and they're\na central part of this story because listen, cramming tens of millions\nof transistors onto a piece of metal-like substance\nfrom the earth is hard to begin with. But as the number of transistors continues to double and double and double, making them becomes\nincredibly complicated. I mean, look at these operations. This is inside of a FAB. And the reason why it looks like they're doing open\nheart surgery here is because even a single speck of\ndust that gets into this FAB and onto one of these\nchips can totally ruin it. So yeah, it was American companies\nwho are designing and making chips, but every year they have\nto spend more and more on these tedious FABS,\nthese factories on steroids. They're getting really spendy, like billions of dollars spendy. Meanwhile an ocean away, you've got a couple of economic\nmiracles happening in all of these countries in East Asia\nthat are rapidly developing and they want in on this\nmicrochip gold rush. (upbeat music) One of these countries is Japan, where a bunch of new tech\ncompanies were getting really good at making chips and they\ncould make them and sell them for way cheaper than the US. Oh, and by the way, this was with the help of\nthe Japanese government who's like subsidizing this,\ngovernments love microchips. That's gonna be a theme in this video. (upbeat music) The US is hating this. They're kind of freaking\nout that Japan is getting in on all the chip gold rush, they\ngotta do something about it. So it's 1987 and the US\ngovernment basically says, no more Japanese chips. They put a 100% tax on Japanese\nchips coming into the US, which not surprisingly just\ncrushes Japan's chip industry. Too bad, so sad, Japan, said\nthe President at the time who was, wait, what the\nhell, Ronald Reagan? The profit of free markets and free trade? Well, what's going on here? - Our aim is to increase\nour national wealth so all will have more. - Well, turns out that\nchips are really important, so important in fact that\nMr. free market economics abandoned his principles\nto protect American chips. This is a theme, we're\ngonna see a lot more of it. Okay, so let's move on. Meanwhile, another Asian economic miracle\ncountry is growing super fast and wants to get in on this,\nbut they also are looking over at Japan and they're like, we don't want the US\nto squash us for trying to compete with them. So if we can't beat 'em, let's join 'em. (upbeat music) Oh, and this is an really\nimportant foreshadow here. Taiwan is looking over here\nat their neighbor China, who's also getting really\nrich and more serious about making good on\ntheir lifelong promise to eventually invade Taiwan and quote, \"Reunite it with China.\" Kind of scary. So in the back of Taiwan's mind, they're also kind of looking\nfor a way to get the West to protect them, so they made a bet, a freaking brilliant bet that solved all their problems at once. At the time, a bunch of engineers in Taiwan\nwere actually leaving Taiwan to go to the US to go to a\nuniversity there and then to actually work for US companies in the cutting edge microchip economy, Texas Instruments, Intel. So the first thing the\nTaiwanese government does is lure them back, they\nguarantee them jobs. They pay for their travel costs, they give them tax breaks\nto create companies. Their goal is to create a\nSilicon Valley in Taiwan and it totally works, it's\nlike a reverse brain drain. Thousands of engineers returned\nto Taiwan to start companies and to help build the\nmicrochip industry in Taiwan. And one of those engineers is the one who actually changed the game,\nthis guy named Morris Chang, he had the best idea of all of them. He had seen that American\nchip makers were hating how much money they had\nto invest in these FABS, these really complicated\nfactories to make microchips. His idea was instead of trying to compete with the United States\nin the chip industry and get crushed like Japan\ndid, let's become their friend. Let's solve their problem. We won't design chips,\nwe won't make devices, we won't make the software. We will just make the chips themselves. We will become the masters of FABS, the tedious expensive job of getting more and more transistors\nonto a piece of silicon. So he starts a company called Taiwan's Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company, TSMC, super promising and creative name, Morris. And the government of\nTaiwan is super into it because now they can get\nin on the chip gold rush and instead of pissing\noff the United States, they actually will solve the\nUS' problem and crucially, make the US reliant on them,\nso now they have protection, a silicon shield to protect them from their big aggressive neighbor. The government gave nearly\nhalf of the startup cost to Morris Chang to start this new venture. They connected him to venture capital and according to Chang himself, the Prime Minister of Taiwan even called a super rich Taiwanese\ninvestor to force him to invest in TSMC. Whoa, okay, yeah, wow. Like you can see just how vital chips are, a little piece of silicon with a bunch of on and off switches. TSMC was basically a state-owned\ncompany from the beginning. So yeah, Taiwan's now in the\ngame and semiconductors are now becoming a geopolitical\nbargaining chip, chip, a geopolitical bargaining chip. I kind of regret it, sorry. (upbeat music) - Go in here. - I believe I'm going to be the nominee. - So it's like the early 2000s and semiconductors are now\nsquarely a part of geopolitics. But meanwhile, in business\nworld in Silicon Valley, they're loving this Taiwan\nsituation because now instead of having to do all of this\nexpensive, tedious FAB stuff, they can just do the\ndesign and the software and the business side of it\nand they can just ship it off to TSMC and they do the rest,\ntaking on the expensive, tedious work of maintaining\ntheir FABS and keeping them up to the cutting edge, which requires billions\nof dollars every year. Like to keep some perspective,\nlook at this graph. This is the number of transistors\non a piece of silicon. By 2010, they're now getting a billion\ntransistors onto a piece of silicon the size of your fingernail. And the only way to do\nthat is to make each one of these insanely small. So let's just take a moment\nto blow our own minds here. Each transistor is becoming\nsmaller than a width of a human hair, wait, no, sorry, that's actually way too big of a scale. A human hair is like\n90,000 nanometers thick. We need to go smaller\nlike a red blood cell. Wait, no, that's still too big. 7,000 nanometers, okay, a virus, something that's not even\ntotally alive, it's so small. Wait, that's 14 nanometers, still too big. I mean we are getting\ninto insane scales here. IBM recently revealed the chip with transistors that\nare two nanometers thick, making them literally\nsmaller than a strand of DNA. So in these FABS, the reason it looks like\nthis is because they have to figure out how to do\nthis and to keep doing it and keep making it smaller and smaller, providing the world with\nthe most advanced chips. And this is why we have nice things. Your entire world revolves\naround what is happening on these little strips of silicon. (upbeat music) - But more and more US chip companies don't actually have FABS. They design them, they do all the software and\nthe machinery and the selling and the business, but the actual making of\nthe chip happened in Taiwan. But as 92% of all advanced\nchips are now made in Taiwan, what this means is that the\nUS is completely reliant on TSMC basically. And finally, we're\ngetting to the conflict. This is where China becomes\nreally important because China, the most populous country\nis suddenly very rich and they want new tech too. So they become actually a giant\ncustomer of all these chips, buying 40% of all the chips in the world, meaning that they are\nnow reliant on the US, who is reliant on Taiwan to\ndesign and make their chips. So let's look at the modern chip industry as it all comes together,\nwhich is gonna set the stage for how this conflict\nis playing out today. Here's a very simplified\nversion of the supply chain. Again, very simplified, it's just insane. I'm not gonna go into the full thing. The US is the one that\nmanufactures the machines, the software, and the designs. Japan makes metals and\nchemicals for chips. The Netherlands makes this\ncrazy UV laser machine that is used to carve the chips. And Taiwan crucially does\nthe expensive tedious job of actually making the chips. Almost all of the most advanced\nchips in the world are made in Taiwan. And then you have China, who is the giant customer in all of this. They're the ones who are\nbuying more and more chips to grow their economy. I mean, look at this\nbeautiful supply chain. You've got a bunch of countries\nthat are involved now, everyone has a part to\nplay and everyone depends on each other for chips. Globalization is great. Economic interdependence is a recipe for peace and mutual prosperity, right? I mean it used to be. But there's something else\nhappening with the supply chain that might be hard to see in this diagram, which is that the US is still\nthe kingpin of this system. They're the most important player. They have the most important\ningredients, the best designs, the best software, and the\nmost machines to make chips. Taiwan, their bestie, has the second most important\ningredients in all of this, the FABS that actually make the chips. China on the other hand is\nin a position of weakness. Their role is basically the\nbig hungry chip consumer, totally reliant on their frenemy, the United States and their\nannoying neighbor, Taiwan, who they want to invade, but now they're reliant\non for cutting edge chips. And what's at stake here for China? Well, it's not just their economy. They don't want chips just\nso they can have a bunch of cool tech. They want it because more and more, they need advanced chips\nfor their military. (upbeat music) It's like the 2010s, China's military is getting kind of scary, but it's not that scary says\nthe IS, we're not that worried. We'll always be ahead\nof China when it comes to controlling the supply chain. And our military gets first\ndibs on all the best chips. China has no chance of catching up ever. And this is true, China was truly behind. They did not have the tech and\nthe designs and the companies and the ability to make advanced chips. They were reliant on the United States. If China pissed off the US, they could just take away their chips. And now we have a rising\nconflict on our hands. (upbeat music) China, this big superpower\nis not gonna let this happen. They realize that they\nhave to do two things. Number one, they have to\nstart making their own chips. They wanna break free and\nstop relying on the US for anything, make their own chips so that\nthe US doesn't have leverage over them. And number two and deeply\nrelated is they want to continue to build up their\nmilitary, to modernize it, to build more war ships and satellites and high tech missiles and\ndrones and eventually AI. All of this needs advanced\nchips, which they don't have. So they're like, we are\ngonna make them on our own. And the US is like, good luck\nChina, you're so far behind. Good luck trying to figure\nout how to do this thing that we've spent the past 60\nyears figuring out how to do, make really expensive chips. Experts in software and\nmachinery and FABS like, you have no chance. So how is China gonna catch up? Lucky for them, in China, there's a blurry line between\nbusinesses and the military. It's all kind of overseen by the state and also lucky for them, there are loads of US tech\ncompanies that are addicted to making money by selling\nmicrochip technology to China. So instead of invent it themselves, they see an opportunity here. Need software and equipment\nfor your new chip industry? Get it from the US. Need fancy chip designs and software? US companies have you covered. Need those high-tech chips produced for your military projects? American companies will sell them to you. And yes, TSMC in Taiwan\nwill make them for you. Wait, China's using US\ntechnology to get ahead of US technology, what? In 2021, the Washington Post reported that China was building\nsuper advanced laboratories to test scary new weapons including nukes. And guess what? They were using American\nsemiconductor tech to do this. It started to become clear\nthat American companies were selling tech and chips and software to Chinese tech companies that\nwere actually just a front for the military. Wow, yikes. The US chip industry is now\nallowing China to get ahead. This was starting to happen, but I think what really woke up the US is when this happened. - [Narrator] Huge step\nforward in China's military. China conducted two tests of a hypersonic missile system, technology that would allow it to fire a nuclear warhead\nfaster than anyone else. - The US does not\ncurrently have the ability to even track this weapon,\nmuch less defeat it. - US military generals wake up one morning to discover that China has\njust tested a new weapon, a missile that flew\naround the entire world, going five times the speed\nof sound, a mile a second. Oh, and it's really hard to see because it flies below radar range. It's super nimble, maneuverable, and has the ability to carry nukes. The US had been working\non something similar, but China beat them to it by years and it was American microchip technology that helped them build it. Oh shit. Yikes. This totally caught them off guard. - [Narrator] Says that US\nintelligence services had no idea that China was so far ahead. - So turns out that while\nthe US government thought that they were running faster\nand that they were fine, they were actually fueling the\nrise of their biggest rival by giving them the technology\nthat they need to get ahead. So the US decides that\nthey've gotta do something. China is ahead on these missiles\nand they might get ahead on things like AI and they're\ndoing it with our tech. No more free trade, no more free markets. The government is jumping\nback into the chip game to sort this out. - Fundamental change\nis taking place today, politically, economically,\nand technologically. - All right, Joe Biden's\nlike rolling up his sleeves. He's like, what do we do here? Step one, cut 'em off,\nno more chips for China. - The Biden administration\npublished a large set of export controls on Friday in order to slow Beijing's technological\nand military advances. - [Speaker] Restrictions will\nlimit Chinese companies access to advanced computer chip. - And here we are, back in the\nfun, bureaucratic paperwork, Department of Commerce, Bureau\nof Industry and Security, docket number 220930-0204RIN0674... \"Certain advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing\nitems, supercomputers, and semiconductor end use,\nentity list modification.\" We're not gonna go through this. This is just a bunch of rules that says no more chips to China. All those cutting edge\nchips that China was buying from US companies, blocked. - [Speaker] The restrictions\nwill limit Chinese companies access to advanced computer chips. - [Speaker] Manufacturing\nequipment they need to make their own chips? Blocked. All that US made vital software\nthat Chinese companies need to design their own chips? Blocked, blocked, blocked. - We will bring these\njobs back to our shores and end our dependence on foreign chips. - All right. - In fact, the Biden administration\nwent super far to say that any company globally\nthat uses US tech to produce chips is now\nblocked from doing business with Chinese firms. - [Speaker] To cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made anywhere in the world with US equipment. - Why stop there? Americans are now forbidden from working for Chinese chip companies,\nthis is huge news. Like this is huge news, this is happening. This is like we're in the\nmiddle of this right now. But let's go back to that visual\nof the whole supply chain. If you cut off this, then\nyeah, you hurt China, but you also hurt the\nother side of this line, US chip makers. Like one example, this\nUS chipmaker, Nvidia, they went from selling\ntons of chips to China to suddenly being banned from doing so. This has led to a $400\nmillion loss in revenue in just one quarter. Poof, up in smoke. One of the biggest chip\nmakers now totally cut off from their big customer\nbecause Joe Biden is afraid of the Chinese military\nand for good reason, which leads to step two of this policy. The Biden administration\nwasn't gonna leave these tech companies out dry. So they gave billions of\ndollars to American chip makers to say, \"Hey, yes, sorry we cut you off from your main customer because\nwe're kind of getting scared of their military, but we have to protect our\nchips, here's a bunch of money.\" Congress passed the CHIPS Act, which gives billions of\ndollars to these companies to create FABS back in the United States. - This time it wasn't Russia\nbut China, another rival power would get way ahead of us if we didn't pull out all the stops. And this legislation\nis the first large step in pulling out all of those stops. - Government wants the\nFABS to come home to ensure that this most valuable\ntechnology isn't solely reliant on outside countries and\nwe're talking giant payouts. 50 billion taxpayer dollars\ngo to companies like Intel, which is now opening a new FAB in Ohio. - We are gonna build the most\nadvanced stuff in the world, right here in Ohio. - Or even TSMC themselves,\nwhich is based in Taiwan, but is now opening a new FAB in Arizona. Keep it in the family. Okay, so this is economic war\nand the Biden administration just did a huge move. Reminder that the reason\nwhy this is important is because it's not just about\nlike business or even missiles. This is about chips. Chips are not just chips,\nchips are the future. Chips are power. Yes, chips mean economic\ngrowth and new cool technology, but chips also mean new weapons. Chips are the currency\nof geopolitical power, kind of like what oil used to be, but now it's freaking silicon with a bunch of on and off switches on it. The US is taking control\nof its valuable resource and cutting China off. So the US makes this big\nmove, cuts China off, and this is geopolitical conflict. They just made the move, the\nball's in China's court now. How will they respond? And this is where Taiwan\ncomes back into the picture. (upbeat music) Taiwan is this small\ncountry that finds itself in the crossfires of this conflict. 92% of all advanced chips\nare made here mostly by TSMC. The US is totally reliant on them. A few months before the Biden\nadministration was doing all of this, making it illegal\nto sell chips to China, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, not just to like shake hands\nwith political leaders, no, she was there to visit TSMC, the chip FAB. What Pelosi was really doing\nhere was signaling to Taiwan that they are vital to American security. US relies on this and will protect it. - Came to Taiwan to make\nunequivocally clear, we'll not abandon our commitment\nto Taiwan and we are proud of our enduring friendship. - And in doing so, she shows us what China's\ncounter move might be in all of this, it might be Taiwan. - Are you willing to\nget involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that? - Yes, that's a commitment we made. - Okay, but wait, what this doesn't mean is like\nChina's gonna invade Taiwan and like take all the chips\nor like take over the FAB or something, that that\nscenario doesn't make any sense. If China invaded Taiwan, all they would find is\na bunch of empty FABS if they weren't bombed already. They wouldn't know how to operate them. They wouldn't have all of the\nengineers and the software and all of the supply chain\nstuff that they would need to actually make chips. They would likely be fighting a war and the US would probably get involved. I made a whole video about\nit, you can go check it out. Anyway, the effective counter move\nhere for China would be to operate right on the\nedge of active warfare to strike back at the US without provoking a military response. This is how big nuclear powers do it. They don't actually clash. They want to just sort\nof poke at each other. One scenario would be\nChina sending a bunch of its navy ships to set up in\nthe ocean right around here, creating a kind of partial blockade. They could stop cargo\nships that are coming to and from the island, kind of just slowing everything down, but really holding the silicon hostage, making it hard for the supply\nchain to actually work. I mean just remember like\nthe Covid 19 chip shortage or like supply chain shortage or even like the Suez Canal blockage from a couple years ago. Imagine those supply chain\nissues, but like on steroids, totally debilitating and being\nused for a hostile purpose to strike back at the US. Like Biden forbidding American companies to sell chips to China, the blockade would be a way to strike at your nuclear armed rival\nwithout going too far, without risking too much\nescalation or a miscalculation. - [Speaker] It's incumbent\nupon us to stay number one. - [Speaker] To lead the\nworld in future industries, protect our national security. - [Speaker] We are gonna build the most advanced stuff in the world. - That's where we're at. We're in the middle of\nanother economic war between big nuclear powers. We don't know what happens next, but one thing that feels clear\nto me is that Cold War vibes are back as these two great\npowers with different ideologies about the world compete with each other. This fight over chips will continue. And this idea in international\nrelations that I kind of took for granted, which is that like globalization\nand interdependence is good and will lead to less conflict, it's being seriously challenged. Economic interdependence\nis being used as a weapon. That's what we're seeing\nhere and not just here. I made a video a couple months ago about how Vladimir Putin\nis cutting off natural gas to Europe, frankly, it's not that much different\nthan Joe Biden cutting off microchips to China. I mean it is different in a\nlot of ways, blah, blah, blah, we get it. But like the the big mechanics of how this conflict is playing out, it's peculiar and and is becoming a part of how conflict looks today. So even as this old\nschool style war continues to rage in Ukraine, we're seeing an evolution\nof how conflict works in our world. Where once a lot of conflict revolved around natural resources\nlike oil, most recently, the currency of power. We've moved to an era\nwhere a magical piece of metal-like substance called silicon, pulsing ones and zeros, is kind of the new oil,\nthe new currency of power, the new thing that we should protect to protect our military supremacy. So in a big shift of the\ntrend of globalization, countries are now turning\ninward to protect their stuff, leading to a new era of\ndistrust, severed connection, and rising tensions. Okay. Okay, okay, semiconductors is over. That's it, I'm now going to\neat a Reese's peanut buttercup from Trader Joe's. Mm, wow that's good. I love this thing. Okay, that's the end of the video. Thanks to Scaler one more time\nfor sponsoring this video. There's link in the\ndescription that gets you on a free class if you wanna try that out. I have a couple things\nI wanna tell you about. Thanks for watching. I like to speak into a\nmicrophone at the end because it makes me feel\nlike I'm a podcaster. Should I start a podcast? People are asking me to start a podcast. What should I talk about on my podcast? Anyway, thanks for watching everyone. So we should probably\ntalk about the Newsroom. So we make a video, an\nextra video every month. It's a behind the scenes\nvlog where we like capture how all of this is made,\nthere's a big team of people, lots of cool fun personalities, lots of very skilled people\nwho touch these videos. I'm just like one cog in the machine. That video goes live every\nmonth and it's available to people who are members of the Newsroom, which is what we call our Patreon. I just like to call it the\nNewsroom 'cause it's like cooler. On the Newsroom, you also\nget access to my scripts, which are like big things that if maybe if you're like a journalist\nor a video storyteller, could be useful for you. You also get access to Tom Fox tracks. Tom Fox is our composer. You get royalty free music\nthat you can use in your videos if you are a member of the Newsroom and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of supporting independent journalism. So the newsroom is over on\npatreon.com/JohnnyHarris. Another thing that I should\nmention is that we have LUTs and presets, which are like\na thing that you can buy and then you can color\nyour video or your photos in the way that we color it. We worked with the professional colorist to develop these things. They're basically presets and\nthey are for photo and video and they look really nice\nbecause I like things to look nice. And welcome to all the\nnew subscribers here. There's been a lot of new people\naround the channel lately, and it's fun to have this community grow. So I'm gonna keep telling\nstories and being curious and learning and looking\nfor evidence and data and questioning my assumptions and I appreciate you all being here. So I'll see you in the next one, bye. (upbeat music)"

    "video_id": "vYgt2gu1ZYc",
    "captions": "Tuscany. Why don't you put salt in your bread?\u00a0\nI have a few theories. One is that Florence is\u00a0\u00a0 kind of far from the coastline, so they\u00a0\ndidn't have access to salt. That doesn't\u00a0\u00a0 really hold up. There's a lot of inland places\u00a0\nthat have salt in their bread. Another theory is\u00a0\u00a0 that all the food eaten in this area is so extra\u00a0\nsalty that eating it with bread, with no salt is\u00a0\u00a0 actually like it balances it all out. Although,\u00a0\nthere's lots of other parts of Italy that also\u00a0\u00a0 eat similarly salty food, but they still put\u00a0\nsalt in their bread. The last theory is the\u00a0\u00a0 Salt War. Back in like 1540, the Pope raised\u00a0\ntaxes on salt in one important Italian city,\u00a0\u00a0 and the people were like, \u201c%$@# that, we'll\u00a0\njust stop salting our bread.\u201d \u201cOh, and now\u00a0\u00a0 we're independent, Pope!\u201d And the Pope was like,\u00a0\n\u201cthat's cute.\u201d And had his army swiftly crush the\u00a0\u00a0 rebellion. So now saltless bread is a tradition\u00a0\ncarried on in the name of defiance. But again,\u00a0\u00a0 this story revolves around a specific city. And\u00a0\nsaltless bread is found all over Tuscany. Plus,\u00a0\u00a0 there's not a ton of historical evidence\u00a0\nsupporting this sudden change in bread baking. And\u00a0\u00a0 there's references to saltless bread in Tuscany,\u00a0\nlike hundreds of years before the Salt War. So,"

(the word \"Breakfast\" echoing) So, the first meal of the day. - Breakfast.\n- Breakfast. - Breakfast.\n- Breakfast. - Break-fast!! - A couple of a years\nago I made several videos condemning American breakfast\nfor being too sweet. And then proceeded to tell\nyou about how cultured I was, because I discovered other\nbreakfast traditions, and integrated them into my life in order to stop hating breakfast. And it worked. But, one thing I failed to mention during all of this breakfast commentary, is that I eat Doritos for breakfast. (music slo-mo to halting)\nLike all the time. (lively music) Doritos. (multiple voices chanting \"Doritos.\") (Doritos crunching)\n(lively music) (lively music)\n(Doritos crunching) (lively music)\n(Doritos crunching) Yes, I eat them with\nchopsticks for obvious reasons. See my fingers? Squeaky clean. (lively music) Wait! I gotta tell you\nsomething really quick. I made a video about China\nand the United States and their economic war over microchips. It's really insane. That video is live right now. You can go watch it on Nebula. In fact, you can watch every\none of my videos a week early. And it costs you just over\none U.S. dollar a month, using a hack that I will\nexplain at the end of the video. For now, let's just keep\nswimming in a sea of Doritos. (lively music)\n(echoing voices) (lively music slows down) but no, I'm serious. This is a real thing. One of Nick's jobs, our studio manager, is to make sure that there\nare Doritos always stocked in the studio. And to be honest, he\ndoes an excellent job. - [Interviewer] Do you like you job, Nick? - I love my job. - [Interviewer] You better\n(censor beep) your job, dude. - Yeah. I work every day. Psych! - Nick has another part of his\njob that's slightly related, I'm now realizing. I'll tell you about that later. I was recently at a wedding in Canada, getting slightly rowdy. And during the party, I had a conversation with my friend, Becky. I was telling her about\nhow much I love Doritos. And especially for breakfast. The first thing Becky did\nwas tell me how much better Canadian chips are,\nespecially Canadian Doritos. She promised that she would\nsend me Canadian Doritos. And indeed, she did. (wrappings crackling)\nOh, yes! (chuckling) We have Doritos from Canada,\nand we have chopsticks. Thank you, Becky. But then she also asked\nme why the breakfast snob, over here who's like condemning all things American breakfast, eats Doritos for the\nfirst meal of the day? But it turns out there's\nan answer to this. One that required a\nlittle bit of research, some expert interviews, an a conversation with the internet's best food science explainer. - And this is just me spit-balling. And I'm not a scientist, I\njust play one on the internet. - The answer to this is yet another stop on my long, strange journey of trying to understand breakfast. And its connection to human evolution, and ancient traditions. And perhaps most\nimportantly, today's economy. Where we live in a world\nwhere literal scientists sit around and engineer food, so that we can't get enough of it. - [Announcer] Try Doritos.\n(man crunching) They taste as good as they crunch. - He's in a better place now. - It's corn, tomato, onions, and spices. - Doritos! (Dorito dust blowing) (upbeat music)\n(man humming) - Oh my God, look at this. (upbeat music) (items in box crackling)\nOh-ho, yes! Dear Johnny, hope you like cheese. P.S., congrats again on the Emmy. Thanks, Becky. (bag crinkling) Today we got Zesty Cheese. (speaking in foreign language) (bag tears open) Zesty cheese. (crunching Doritos) Oh my God! It's like\nnacho cheese with a kick. Oh, yeah. This is good. (crunching Doritos) Dude, they're extra salty, too. - The cornerstone of any\nnutritious breakfast. - This is amazing. Canada kills it with chips. Okay, let's get this started. I think first we need\nto talk about Doritos. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Cool Ranch flavored Doritos brand tortilla chips. One heck of a crunch. (bag crinkling) - This is a Dorito. It is a triangle of mashed up\ncorn, that is baked, fried, and coated with a magical cheesy powder. (blowing on dust) This orange dust is a mix\nof garlic, Romano cheese, and cheddar cheese. We got a total of 25\ndifferent ingredients on here. And in the case of Cool Ranch- - No other chip tastes like Cool Ranch. (bag crinkles) - Basically the same ingredients. Like Cool Ranch has a couple of things that I can't really pronoun here. Like Sodium Acetate, Disodium Inosinate, Inosinate. Disodium Guanylate. Guanylate. And crucially, both of these bags, plus Becky's Canadian flavor,\ncontain a magic powder called Monosodium Glutamate. A mysterious thing that I think is at the center of why\nI love this so much. And why I want it for breakfast. - My precious. (snapshots flashing)\n(lively music) - This is really delicious. (lively music)\n(crowd & Mrs. Biden giggling) - This magic ingredient\nwas invented in Japan a hundred or so years ago. When this Japanese chemist\nwas supposedly trying to figure out why his wife's\nsoup tastes so damn good. He did a bunch of science, and realized it was this strip of kelp, which is basically like seaweed, but technically it's\nnot seaweed, it's kelp. This was the key ingredient. He saw his wife put this\nstrip of kelp in boiling water at the beginning of soup-making. And then taking it out. And whatever happened\nduring that short time made all the difference. Wait a minute. This same thing happens\nevery Monday in my studio. (upbeat music) Oh, it smells good in here,\nNick, what you making? - Miso soup for miso Monday. - Miso Monday. Every Monday we have\nMiso soup in this office. Because like Doritos, Miso is a very important\npart of my morning. - Yeah, makes the whole week good. It really does.\n- [Nick] A big pot of miso. So now with Japanese kelp. From (speaking in foreign language). I bought it at my local Japanese market, Hanna Japanese Market. Love you guys. - [Host] And what do you do with it? - [Nick] Put it in there\nlike while it's hot, growing boil, for about 20 minutes. (quick musical interlude) Take it out, adds that\nessential sea flavor. We got the spigot on the o there side. So when the soup's done,\nwe're gonna dispense it. Ow, it's very hot. - We will be back for the miso. Thanks, Nick.\n- [Nick] See you guys. (record scratching)\n- Wait! But what does this have\nto do with Doritos? (record scratching) - Everything. This has everything to do with Doritos. Let me explain.\n(serious violin music) - Hm, I really want some miso soup. (quiet explosion and tiny bell ringing) Oh my God! Miso soup! - Everything is. Because this Japanese chemist discovered that this seaweed, or kelp, contained a bunch of one special molecule called glutamate, or glutamic acid. It's actually an amino acid. And, it's actually the\nmost abundant amino acid that you find in breast milk. Like the first thing you taste\n(baby cooing) when you come into this world.\n(baby cooing) When glutamate is present in your mouth, it makes everything you're\neating taste more delicious, and more substantial. Meaty and more savory. The guy kept poking around, and discovered that this\ndelicious chemical reaction was not just happening in his wife's soup from the kelp she was putting in, but also in a bunch of\nother delicious foods. Like ripe tomatoes, meat and cheese. Broths, mushrooms, asparagus, fish sauce, parmesan cheese. The Japanese chemist\nclaimed that glutamate had such a significant impact on taste, that it deserved its own classification. At the time, there were four major classes of taste. Sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. He said there should be a fifth. Oh and by the way, if you've ever had this\ntaste map in school, like I did, of where your taste buds taste things. That's kind of BS. Your taste receptors overlap, and they're sort of all\nover on your tongue. Anyway, that was a kind\nof annoying side note. Let's get going. He called this taste \"Umami.\" Which beautiful in Japanese, roughly translates to \"Deliciousness.\" Why call it some technical thing, when you'd just be like, \"It's deliciousness.\" That is what it'll be classified. Umami, the taste experience, was officially recognized\nby scientists in the 90s. And there's been a lot of\nreally amazing work on it. But story is really just beginning. Because this Japanese chemist found a way to extract this delicious\nflavor from the kelp, and to mass produce it in the\nform of a flakey white salt. He called it monosodium glutamate, or M-S-G. Pure glutamate put into\nthe form of a salt. And this is the key ingredient\nthat coats all of our Doritos and makes them delicious. (Dorito crunching) And this is where it all comes together. Linking my Dorito craving\nto my love for miso soup. One, a wholesome soup with\ncountless benefits to my health. And the other, a strip of fried corn paste with really no nutritional value. And yet, I crave both\nof them when I show up to work in the morning. Because what I'm really craving here, is the chemical reaction\nthat produces umami in a savory deliciousness. Either from the glutamic\nacid in Nick's kelp, or from the special white powder that I often sniff up. I mean that coats my, the\nsurface of the Doritos. (bag crinkling)\n(Doritos crunching) (upbeat music) I think it's ready. C'mon. It's ready! Here we go! Mm. Okay. Don't mind if I do. Hey Nick, by the way, is MSG bad for you? - I don't know. Why don't you ask Adam Ragusea? - Yeah, Adam Ragusea. - [Nick] I don't know. - Hey, Adam! Oh, there we go. Hi!\n- [Adam] What's up? - Oh, maybe I'm not mic'd. Oh, hold on. Sorry, I can't hear you.\n- [Adam] you are mic'd, I can hear you.\n- It's probably the out- - Checkity, checkity, check. - I've watched your face for many hours. And it's always surreal to be like. And now the guy who I\njust watched talk to me, is talking to me. - That's what you think. Actually, I'm gonna talk right past you. - Yeah. (laughing) - Anyways- - So, MSG. - I got some right here. - Oh, you have MSG with you? I do, too. Look. - There you go. Oh, yeah. - Do you have any aversion to MSG? - No, no, no, no, no. It's just one of the\nchemicals that you need. It's not essential. Because your body can make\nit out of other things. But you still like it for a reason. You gotta have it. But too much of anything\nis not good for you, baby. Except Barry White. - Too much of anything\nis no good for you baby. - Come to think of it, he said that for the purposes\nof refuting it in the song. - Oh! - Because he was saying in fact, he can't get enough of your love, baby. - There is no too much.\n- There is no too much. - And that particular highly-rarefied case of your love, babe. But in all other cases, too much of anything is\nnot good for you, baby, and that includes glutamate. - Talking to Adam Ragusea for an hour, the guy's deathly smart on this. And he has an entire video about MSG. The whole story, the chemistry, all of it. It's like way deeper than I will ever go on anything food related. Go watch that if you want\nthe deep dive on MSG. But the (indistinct), is that\nMSG got branded as dangerous. Because of one short letter to the editor that spread a rumor. A rumor that Chinese\nrestaurants were very dangerous because they were putting\nMSG in their food. Even though there wasn't\nevidence for that, it created this rumor\nthat has sort of stuck with all of us today. - [Announcer] MSG causes migraines for literally millions of people. - This is really, really scary. And we do not understand\nthe impact of MGS. - [Announcer] An MGS can cause swelling, as well as chest pains. A burning sensation, and an overall feeling of weakness. There may be more to this public poison. - The child will have permanent\nimpairment of the brain, according to some of these studies. And will grow up like\n10 years old, stupid. Not to mention fat. - The whole thing became\nkind of racist, and panicky. And it was also based on\nthe fact that we called it. We called it MSG, monosodium glutamate, instead of calling it Aji-No-Moto. When you get, when you refer to anything by it's chemical name, it sounds scary. - Aji-No, whatever. - But I'm talking to\nAdam for one question. Which is why do a crave\nthis stuff in the morning? - We crave all kinds of\nthings that our body needs. We are evolved to seek out the things that we need to survive. It's just the simplest form of evolution you could ever imagine. The taste of umami in food signals to us that we are eating something\nthat is protein rich. And we need protein in order\nto replenish our muscles, and do all kinds of other\nimportant things in our body. We were programmed to love\nit and gobble it down, because we need it. - And this is what I've learned about my craving for\nDoritos in the morning. It's a big trick. What I want in the morning is\nthe salty, savory experience of umami. I don't want the sweet\nfluff that comes from traditional American breakfast, with sweet liquid sugar poured on it. Again, this what has lead me to bitch about American breakfast\nfor several years. But a very uncomfortable reality is that in a busy life, making all of this food is kind of hard. It takes time, it takes effort. Shout out to Nick. Thanks, Nick! - [Announcer] Nacho Cheese\nDoritos Brand Tortilla- - How much is enough? How big\ndoes this pile have to be? - I happen to live at a time in history where food scientists sit around and use their brilliant science knowledge to engineer food that\nsomehow tricks my brain into thinking it's getting the food that evolution has\ntrained my brain to crave. In other words, these chips are actually tricking my brain into thinking I'm eating some\nprotein-rich, wholesome meal. But clearly, I'm not. - There's a historian of\nscience named Dr. Sarah Tracy in Canada. Her central thesis is that\nall the conversations we have about whether or not MSG is bad for you, that all kind of misses the point. All of that is small potatoes. Like the big potato is that\nMSG is really, really good at making garbage foods taste delicious. - Whoa. - Making you want to eat\nthe most refined corn paste that really should be used\nlike as a packing material, rather than a food. But, it's unbelievably cheap to make, and lasts forever in bag. And you can make a person\nto actually want to eat it. If you put MSG on it. - This was one of the original aims of the Japanese chemist who invited MSG. He looked around and saw\nall these poor farmers who only had plain rice\nand vegetables to eat. And he marketed his MSG as a way to allow these farmers to\nelevate their meals. For them to taste more\nsavory and more delicious. More fulfilling, more satisfying, if they just sprinkle\nthis magic powder on top. - Cool Ranch!\n(Doritos crunching) (upbeat music)\n(goofy spring coiling) - So yeah, that is why I\neat Doritos for breakfast. Because some brilliant corporation invented a substance that\ntricks my brain into thinking that I'm eating miso soup, or stew, or parmesan cheese, or whatever. And in the process, they perfected it. Everything about this thing is engineered. The powder is so finely-ground that it fills every nook\nand cranny of your mouth. And literally triggers the\nrelease of more saliva. Literally making your mouth water. They're crunchy, yet light. They seem to melt in your mouth after giving you that satisfying crunch, which tricks your body into wanting more. To be honest, I feel like\nthis is just yet another way that corporate America dupes me by high-jacking my physiology. But that doesn't mean that I'm gonna stop eating\nDoritos for breakfast! Plewf! Thanks for watching everyone,\nsee you on the next one. (\"Seinfeld-inspired\" type closing music) (snoring and deep exhale/inhale) Whoa! Yeah, it's me again. Hi, everyone. I'm sitting in a sea of Doritos. Something I thought I would never do for my professional\ncareer. But, here I am. So, as I mentioned earlier at\nthe beginning of the video, I have made a video that\nis an insanely deep-dive into the geo-politics of\nChina and the United States. Who are currently at\nwar over semiconductors, or microchips. A piece of technology that\nis basically the future. And the TLDR is that if\nyou have good microchips, you can do really cool military stuff. Anyway, I don't wanna give it all away. That video goes live here\non the channel next week. But, I have started publishing everyone of my videos\na week early on Nebula. Nebula is a creator-owned\nstreaming platform. No ads. It is a place where you\nsubscribe for very, very cheap. And you get to watch\ntons of amazing creators that focus a lot on\nlearning about the world. I am now on Nebula, and my whole library is on Nebula at free. And everyone of my videos is going up a week early on Nebula. Nebula is the streaming\nservice that literally I watch. Like it's the one that I'm into. Creators like Legal Eagle, or PolyMatter, or \"RealLifeLore, have exclusive content that you can't get anywhere else. Like this one from RealLifeLore\ncalled \"Modern Conflict.\" Which is just awesome. Super high-quality stuff that you can get if you\na subscriber to Nebula. So the big question is\nhow much does it cost? Everyone wants to know how much it costs. The answer is if you go\nthrough the front door, it's like five bucks a month, or 15 bucks a year. Pretty good deal. But you can get it for\njust over a dollar a month if you use the hack that\nI'm about to explain. Go to the link in my description. And it will take you to Curiosity Stream. Which is a partner of Nebula. Curiosity Stream, itself, is a huge repository of amazing\nhigh-quality documentaries, which big names like David Attenborough, and tons of really interesting stuff. But the point here is if\nyou sign up for literally the cheapest plan on Curiosity Steam, using the special link, and use my code. You gotta use my code in\norder to get the discount, and to support my channel. You will get an email from Nebula saying, \"Hey, you now have a Nebula\naccount, make a password.\" And now you have access to every one of my videos a week early. Plus, tons of other exclusive\ncontent from other creators, all ad-free. It's an insanely good deal. And what I love most about it, is it's all creator-owned. These are a bunch of\ncreators who got together and made a streaming service. It allows us to make really\ncool ambitious stuff. You don't have to worry about\nlike ad-friendly guidelines, like we have to adhere to here on YouTube. Anyway, this is an insane deal. And it's a way to support\nthis channel, too, when you click that\nlink and use that code. I'm trying to establish\na presence on Nebula. Not only with publishing\na video a week early. But, if enough people\nsign up using my code, and they see that\nthere's a lot of interest from my audience, they will fund a documentary project that I've been wanting to work\non for a really long time. A really deep, ambitious original that will live only on Nebula. So, the link is in the description. The code is Johnnyharris with no spaces. And I am sitting in a sea\nof Doritos for some reason. Thank you all for being here. I hope you enjoyed this Doritos piece. And I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. (reflective music)"

    "title": "How Europe Stole Africa (so quickly)",
    "video_id": "LjieOlWXwTw",
    "captions": "(light orchestral music) - We need to look at something astounding that happened over the course\nof like a hundred years. This is the final chapter, and what I think is the\nmost mind-boggling chapter, in the story of how Europe\ntook over the world. The reason why it's so mind-boggling is because this is the part of the story where the map goes from\nlooking like this in 1800 with Europe controlling like\n35% of the world's land, to looking like this by 1914. (light orchestral music) With 84% of the Earth being\ncontrolled by the people or the descendants of the people from this once isolated\ncontinent in Europe. 84%, how on Earth did this happen? A huge part of this next chapter has to do with this continent, the second largest continent on Earth and the part of the\nworld that the Europeans hadn't really carved up yet. So this is where the whole\nstory comes together. It shows us how technology\nand different ways of thinking helped these people take over the world, and in the process, shaped\nthe world we live in today. The way that we trade,\nwhere we get our stuff, the language I'm using to\nspeak to you right now, and most of you understand it even though you don't live\nanywhere near the place where it was invented. I'm telling you, this isn't\nfar away history anymore. This is the world we currently live in. So let me show you the\nthird and final chapter of how Europe stole the world. (orchestral music) Another video, another set\nof beautiful printed maps. And I'm telling you, this is the chapter where\nthe maps get really good. Cartography really took off. Okay, let's get up to\nspeed on where we're at. Remember it all started\nwith Spain and Portugal. They ramped up this colonialism\nthing back around 1500 and this led them to divide\nthe world between them until other European\ncountries got in on it, too. Then the real competition started. The Dutch created the modern corporation, which allowed them to\nspeed all of this up. The world quickly turned\ninto a giant marketplace run by Europeans with boats and guns and incentives to bring profits to the shareholders back home. (playful music) This is all a huge part of the story, but I'm telling you,\nwhen it comes to scale, imperialism is just getting started and that's because Europeans\nare about to level up. We're gonna call this Imperialism 2.0, a new way of taking over the world, fueled mostly by technology\nand a rare cooperation between all of these empires. One British prime minister described this Imperialism 2.0 as, \"the vulgar and bastard imperialism of irritation and aggression, of grabbing everything even\nif we had no use for it.\" But let me tell you, if you're like me and you kind of have a\nlow key implicit belief that European domination was inevitable and that this was gonna\nhappen no matter what, I'm here to tell you that\nit almost didn't happen. That's because by the end of the 1700s revolution was in the air. (light orchestral music) Empires were losing their colonies, starting with a group of Europeans who were done having a king\nand declaring independence for themselves in the late 1700s. Soon you had a bunch of Spanish colonies declaring independence. And then over here in Haiti\nyou had enslaved people who were organizing and rebelling against their French masters, throwing them out and\nstarting their own country. These empires weren't only\nlosing their colonies. Back in Europe, one ruler even\nlost his head in all of this. The empires were losing their grip and soon they were\nfighting with one another like never before. It was chaos and it totally freaked these European rulers out. Are they losing their empire? Are they gonna lose their reigns on power? Is the era of abundance and\ndomination coming to an end? No, we can't let this happen. So they start doing something\nthat was kind of unheard of. Instead of fighting and\ncompeting with each other, like they've always done, the European powers start\ntalking to each other. Their empires were in jeopardy and they needed to collaborate, find ways to share power\nboth at home in Europe, but also on the world stage. Soon, this new culture of\ndiplomacy and collaboration would turn to focus on the one continent that none of these European\npowers had carved up yet. The new imperial frontier. Certainly full of resources, but not yet conquered. (whimsical music) I mean, the maps tell the story here. The maps were like a record\nof what Europeans knew and didn't know about the world. I mean, this one British\nmap from 1800s says it all. Look at this thing. Europeans were definitely\nfamiliar with Africa, especially here in the coast, where for hundreds of years\nthey had trading posts, and of course, the Atlantic slave trade. But look how they mapped the\ninterior of the continent. It literally just gives up and is like inland parts\nalmost entirely unknown, which is pretty rare for this time period. At this point, the\nEuropeans had really mapped a lot of the world, but this place was off limits. It was the stuff of legend, of myths. The caption here on the map says that this interior part of\nAfrica \"may be considered as absolutely unknown or\ncompletely unexplored. All we know,\" says the map, \"is that its immense and arid sands are intersected with complete collections\nof the most ferocious beasts and most uncivilized men.\" That's all they know. (light music) There was a very good reason for this. The fact is that soldiers\nand explorers from Europe who went into this area, a lot of 'em didn't come home. Up to 40% died from diseases like the mosquito-borne illness, malaria. So much so that this part of the map became known as the White Man's Grave, totally off limits. But that soon changed. (playful music) Two giant things happen\nthat change everything, completely redirect what Europeans can do with their mounting power. First, these two French guys are able to take the bark of this tree, which had been used for a very long time for a variety of purposes and isolate a vital\nchemical called quinine. It combats malaria, the major\nkiller of Europeans in Africa. They now have a white man's shield to protect them from\nthe White Man's Grave. The door is slowly creaking open. Second, this guy happens. King Leopold II, he's the\nking of this new country called Belgium, and it\nexisted for like 40 years. It's kind of a minor place in Europe, nothing like these OG colonizers. So it's like 1875, and\nKing Leopold wants to play with the big boys. He wants a colony. So he literally goes\naround and starts asking these major colonial powers\nfor like some of their land. Like he goes to the\nOGs, Spain and Portugal, and he's like, \"Hey guys,\nI know you're in decline. Can I have one of your colonies?\" And they're like, \"No.\" So then he goes to the\nBritish and he's like, \"Hey guys, I know you have New Guinea, maybe you don't have any plans for it. You could give it to me.\" And they're like, \"No, Leo. Don't you realize how hard\nwe worked to steal this land? We're not gonna give it\nto you as a handout.\" So King Leopold decides to take\nmatters into his own hands. He turns to the map and\ndecides this part of the map, the parts unknown, where\nnone of the colonizers have arrived to yet, is a\nprime place for his colony. King Leopold sets his sight\non the White Man's Grave. A quick reminder that this is kind of the fantasy of the Europeans who haven't explored this. In reality, at this point, Africa looks a lot more like this. But in the mind of King\nLeopold and other Europeans, it's a big, blank canvas\nwith unlimited possibilities. So Leopold sends explorers\nto like the dead center of this blank canvas. And they're armed, not only with some of the latest and greatest weapons, but also with medicine that shields them from these killer tropical diseases. These Belgian explorers arrive and are able to make\nagreements with the locals, laying claimed to this land. King Leopold now has his own little colony in the center of the White Man's Grave. And of course, they start mapping it. This is a map from a bunch of Belgian cartographers and explorers when they first arrive to\nthis center part of Africa. Very little detail here at the beginning. This is 1880. They basically got this river, some of the offshoots, but they don't really know\nwhat's going on in here yet. This becomes the frame that Leopold uses to build his colony. (light music) Now of course, this freaks the French out because they're like, \"Hey,\nwhat's Belgium doing in Africa? Why are they exploring all this land?\" So they decide to send their own explorers to claim their own bit of land. After all, they've got the medicine, it's not nearly as dangerous, and the Belgians are doing it. Well, of course now the\nBritish are waking up. They're sending people, too. And even the new kid\non the imperial block, Germany is chipping in, and now suddenly we've got\na scramble on our hands. (tense orchestral music) \"But wait,\" say the European powers, \"Let's learn from our mistakes. Instead of the old days where we always had to fight over things, in this era of revolution and warfare, remember that we're trying to be better about talking to one another? Coordinating, remember?\" So it's 1884 and all these big, Africa hungry European empires\nget together in Berlin. I mean, there's amazing painting of just them all sitting here, looking at this big beautiful map, which would be like an\namazing activity to do until you realize what's\nactually happening here. You've got the chancellor of Germany, you've got the OG colonizers, Portugal explaining this place to Belgium and France and Italy, and you've even got the new\ncountry, the United States who showed up kind of new\nto all this imperial stuff, but quickly learning\nhow power really works on the international stage. Basically, anyone in\nEurope who didn't have an empire yet got in now. Oh, and crucially, they didn't\ninvite any African leaders. And to be clear, this painting\nisn't like exaggerated, like it's not a political cartoon. This is literally a\nbunch of European dudes in a room in Berlin in 1884 discussing and coordinating\nhow they're going to carve up and take this continent. And they decided that there\nwas gonna be one big rule for this new scramble for Africa. No pretending. None of this only on the\nmap, fake imperialism thing that the Pope arranged\nfor Spain and Portugal a few hundred years previous. You actually have to control the land if you're gonna claim it. So they divide up the\nmap on who gets what, they leave the conference, and they get to work. The French start moving in\nquickly from West Africa. The British begin taking over Sudan and expanding north from\ndown here in South Africa to take over all of this land. The Germans really start\nestablishing themselves here and over here. Italy starts occupying\nall this land up here in the north and east. And Leopold, well, he got his colony. 77 times the size of Belgium, here it was as a blank canvas when they first started exploring in 1880. Here it is 14 years later. Little Belgium down here,\ngiant Congo up here. The blueprint is filled out,\nthe conquest is complete. With his new colony,\nKing Leopold, of course, went on to do horrible things, exploiting, pillaging the\nresources from this place and wreaking horrible havoc on the people. And it is horrific and it is horrendous, and I made a whole other video that kind of goes into it more. I'll link to it and go to the sources in the description, please. Okay.\n(intense orchestral music) All of these empires\nwere carving up this map, coming in, mapping it very beautifully. It's like literally the\nopposite of what it was. It's unknown and now it's totally known. Pillaging the resources,\nbringing it back home, making record profits,\net cetera, et cetera. And all of this, this carving, it happened really fast. (intense orchestral music) But wait a minute, hold on, pause. How does this make any sense? Like it made sense when\nit was all like on water and there were ships\nand there was domination and trading ports and all of that, but this, this is an incredibly, logistically ambitious thing to do. Like this was actually a\ncentral question for me that led me to make this series because I just didn't\nunderstand how these countries, in a matter of a few years, could completely carve up\nthe second largest continent? Well, the answer to that question isn't that surprising. These Europeans now had a leg up. They had new tools. (upbeat music) Remember they had invented\ncapitalism to make them rich. That gave them time to do science, which gave them technology that they used to make their capitalism\nbetter and more effective, more productive. This cycle repeated itself\nover and over and over, giving Europeans a further and further leg up technologically, until soon they had stuff\nlike this, a steamboat. You didn't have to worry\nabout the wind anymore to keep going. You could just steam your way\nall the way up African rivers. - Or the old African queen. - Or the railroad, quick way\nto transport food and troops. Like you can see this map, all of this red is either\nrailroads that they put in or railroads that they were\nconstructing at this time. This allowed Europeans to level up, not just in Africa, but everywhere. I mean, here they are in India. The British quickly taking\nover this entire subcontinent of what today's India and\nPakistan and Bangladesh with this massive complex rail system that they built basically in no time. They also invented the telegraph, which could now relay messages\nin a matter of minutes instead of weeks. I mean, this political\ncartoon really personifies how powerful this was. And of course, what we've been\nlooking at this whole time. (upbeat music) They made maps. (orchestral music) Big, beautiful juicy maps\nshowing the geography and the people and all of the\nland that they had conquered. In addition to technology, these empires had also perfected the art of allying with local power holders and turning the people against each other. \"Divide and conquer,\" which allowed a small group of Europeans to control millions of locals. And of course, they had these. (orchestral music) These refined killing machines that allowed small groups\nof European soldiers to rip through truly\nformidable African armies. Like look at this painting from Sudan where the British used their guns to slaughter 10,000 enemies\nwith just a few hundred losses. And hear this casual caption showing that these savages were now \"mowed down by these\nmodern weapons of war, clearing way for civilization.\" Now, it wasn't this easy everywhere. Descendants of white Dutch settlers held off the British for a long time down here in South Africa, and the Ethiopians were able\nto hold off the Italians from conquering their land, making it the only place in\nAfrica to never be colonized. But listen, in the midst\nof all this bloodshed, we have to talk about something\nthat doesn't fit cleanly into our narrative of good versus evil. Because the presence of these\nEuropeans in this continent also brought really positive things. Remember those French\ndudes that discovered the treatment for malaria? Well that was tested in the field in French Algeria, a colony. It changed medicine forever, giving us our modern\nunderstanding of mosquitoes and the diseases they spread. This scramble into Africa\nhelped push forward our understanding of health\nand disease and medicine. These and tons of other\nmedical developments help these Europeans conquer land, but it also brought innovation\nthat we still use today that has saved countless lives. (light music) Okay, so technology was\na major defining factor, but it wasn't just technology. Once again, we see in this chapter what we saw in other chapters. That Europeans had to develop new, sophisticated mental inventions that allowed this all to go down. The popular story that they\nwere telling themselves at this time was that all civilization could be ranked according\nto the level of development. And look, according to this analysis, they placed themselves at the top and they could tell themselves very easily that they were the enlightened\npeople of the world. This new colonizing story was the most sophisticated\nand tantalizing yet, and it's one that's still kind of embedded in a lot of our brains still. That the enlightened\ncivilization had a burden to bring civilization to\nthe rest of the world. And for that, they kind of needed to stay on top and control. And the reason why this story was so believable and tantalizing is because at this time it was being blended with\nactual real objective science that was being done by Europeans. Like this guy, Charles Darwin, someone who changed the way that we think about the natural world. He had just put out a book\nabout how animals evolved into hierarchies with different\ncapabilities and traits. Well, if that applies to all animals, then it must apply to humans themselves and their societies and\ntheir civilizations. So then they go out into\nthe field with their maps and they start gathering observations that confirm this story. And soon, they're\nmeasuring people's skulls all around the world. They're keeping notes, they're developing theories and terms, they're writing academic papers, all of this to define a pretend set of pseudo-scientific ideas, the idea that we're all\npart of a different race, all with different natural capabilities. And that is what must explain why some people have the\nresources and the technology and others do not. Like the previous stories that\nEuropeans told themselves, this one was intoxicating. Think of all the generations that passed where this story could be ingrained into the minds of the people. But again, remember that I'm not saying that these Europeans\nare telling themselves this story every day. We're now talking about the great, great, great grandchildren of like\nthe original colonizers. The individual people didn't\nhave the grand plan in mind to go carve up Africa. They were just responding\nto what they knew, what they'd been told was real, what they wanted to believe. It was a way of life. It was a way of thinking. And if we think that we're somehow exempt from a similar type of mental\nmodel that we don't see but that dictates our behavior, we're tricking ourselves. I mean, listen to one of\nthese British imperialists, Cecil Rhodes. He says, \"We happen to be\nthe best people in the world with the highest ideals\nof decency and justice, liberty and peace. And the more of the world we inhabit, the better it is for humanity.\" Okay, Cecil has made up his mind. (orchestral music) Okay, so let's look at the map in like the early 1900s. Africa looks like this, completely carved up by European powers. Over here, the Dutch had conquered the entire Indonesian archipelago. The French completely taking over this part of Southeast Asia. But the real kingpin in all\nof this taking over land stuff was the British Empire. In addition to all this\nstuff they had in Africa, they occupied the huge\nIndian subcontinent. They also had a few of\nthese important ports like Hong Kong and Singapore. I mean, I can't go over all\nof the stuff they took over 'cause it's just too much. At the peak of their empire, they ruled over 412 million people, which was a ton for that time. Their domination had spread\nto almost 25% of the globe, making Britain this rainy\nset of islands in Europe the biggest empire that ever existed. In doing so, they spread their people, their ideas, their economic system, their fringe language to\nevery corner of the world, including where I'm sitting right now. Because remember, the US\nis just one expression of the British Empire, the branch of the empire that went on to become the most powerful\ncountry in the world to influence how the\nworld order would look. By 1914, Europe had successfully\ntaken over the world. (light music) They were deathly rich compared\nto the rest of the globe. And their ideas, both good and bad, were deeply embedded in\nthe international system. But suddenly, all of this technology, all this industrialization\nthat made them so effective, turned away from conquering faraway lands and was turned on each other. (cannon explodes) (orchestral music) Over the next 30 years,\nhundreds of millions of people are killed in the two\nmost destructive wars ever made possible by all the same things that allow Europeans\nto take over the world, sophisticated weapons in technology that Europeans are now\nturning on each other. The so-called sophisticated race is now slaughtering one another on an unprecedented scale. These wars didn't do the image of the civilized Europeans any good. And Western-schooled\nlocal elites decided that they didn't wanna be ruled\nby foreign forces anymore. They were able to rally their\npeople around common language and birth to national\nidentity that didn't include being ruled by white people\nfrom some faraway continent. And they pushed the colonists out, sometimes peacefully, but\nmost often with force. The Europeans had built\nthis insane global project for more than 400 years, and yet they saw it crumble\nin a matter of decades. (tense orchestral music) So, today, the map has\nbeen severely redrawn. Former colonies are now\nmostly independent countries. There are still a ton of\nweird, idiosyncratic holdovers from the colonial period. I've talked about those many times and I will continue to talk about them. (light music) I wanna finish this up, finish this video and\nfinish this series up with my last thought here, which is something that the\nmap doesn't tell us much about. (light music) Even though all these\ncountries became independent and they can claim their own\nsovereignty, their own borders, their colonizers are gone. They didn't actually. Not only were there loads of borders that were literally drawn by colonizers, I mean, see basically\nall of my previous work. But by the end of this it was the Europeans that\nhad tied the whole world up into an interconnected system that still kind of echoed the old one. The Dutch invention of the\nshareholder corporation didn't go away. Private companies didn't\nsuddenly stop looking for the same far off places to find resources, to find labor, to feed increasing demand\namong their people back home. And European rulers and their offspring didn't stop using their big\nmetal guns and their technology to get what they wanted In faraway lands. Occasionally talking to each other and occasionally fighting with each other. Fighting to control\nland, to control people, to control ideas, and\nperhaps most powerfully, the idea that our enlightened\nway was indeed the best way. - We will stand with\nthe new leaders of Iraq as they establish a government of, by, and for the Iraqi people. - Certainly it has not gone away. (light music) And yet, if it were only that simple, a simple narrative of good and bad, greedy Europeans take over the world and do anything to stay ahead, that would be a lot easier in some ways, but it's not. Europe taking over the world has also thrust humanity\ninto an age of peace and prosperity where people live longer, suffer less in a lot of ways, have more food to eat. I mean, the very moral lens that you and I are using right now to evaluate the good\nand bad of this history, that was a lens that was\ncultivated and developed by the same cultures that pillaged and subjugated their\nway around the planet. These ideals of justice and equality and human rights and representation, social equality and self-determination, those ideas permeated the globe alongside the colonizers who carved it up. And yet, it was this conquest\nthat put these people on top of the whole system giving us the power and the advantage, the default power holders in our world. (light orchestral music) These three parts have been a story of how an isolated\ngroup of farming people, some of them my ancestors, left their shores to explore, discovering a vast world that eventually they would find a way to control. And in the process, setting the rules for how things work today. What's slightly scary to me about this is how easy it is to look\nback on this whole history and feel like it was gonna happen this way no matter what, that it was inevitable. That of course Europeans\ntook over the world. They were always more adept, they were bound to control the planet. But if there's anything I've learned diving into this broad tour\nthrough European imperialism is that this idea is just hindsight bias. This didn't happen because\nof some superior DNA or because God wanted these\npeople to take over the world, but rather it happened to\nbecause a bunch of people happened to be at the right place that allowed them to start a chain of millions of little decisions that pushed them to do whatever they could to procure more and more resources. They got ahead because\nof lucky circumstances. And yet today in our modern world, we continue to do whatever\nwe need to to stay ahead while simultaneously believing that it was always gonna happen this way. (light music) It's over. It's over. I mean, the series is over, but the year is over. I deserve this. Not only is it the end\nof the Europe series, it's the end of the year and what a year it has been. By the way, this video is\nnot sponsored by anyone, probably because we're in a recession. And so I'm gonna take this time to just reflect a little bit\non what this year has meant for me as a storyteller and a journalist and for our team and what\nwe are gonna do next. I think for me, the big\nthing I learned this year was that we can build a big operation. Like for a long time it was just me kind of pushing buttons on a laptop and like making stories. And this year, it actually became a team. We now have lots and lots of people making really, really cool\nstuff, a very talented team. And we're doing journalism on\na level that we've never done. We go really deep on every fact\nthat we say on this channel, and that requires a lot of work. Sometimes that feels really tiresome, but a lot of the time that feels exciting. That we on YouTube can be\ndoing like hardcore journalism and fun stuff too, obviously. We got to do a few in the\nfield documentaries this year, which was really amazing. I went to Paris and Korea and Switzerland. We printed a lot of amazing maps and showed you what maps\nwere like over the years and what they were used for. Oh, and my hair got really long 'cause I decided for the\nfirst time in my life not to cut it, and that's making my\nwhole no shampoo thing a little more complicated. Maybe I'll make a video about that. Anyway.\n(romantic music) I eat a lot of Doritos. Like a lot of Doritos. Like I really like Doritos, even after I know how they're made. But in my mind, this is\nkind of just the beginning. Like I want this to be the beginning. I want like four years from\nnow to look back and be like, \"Oh yeah, 2022. That was the year that we\nreally started to ramp up.\" And that gets me to the thing that I'm really excited about\nthat we launched this year, which is a community on\nPatreon called The Newsroom. A place where people like you support us in what we're trying to do here and allow us to grow. More and more, and especially\nduring economic downturn and unpredictability, this work that we do relies\non community support, on people like you showing\nup and supporting us. And it's our Newsroom\nsupporters that are allowing us to do better work, to do more of it, and I'm very grateful for that. In addition to supporting\nindependent journalism, Newsroom members also get\naccess to a bunch of cool stuff, like a behind the scenes vlog, an extra video every month. There's a lot of really talented, interesting people behind the scenes. And every month you get\na vlog where you see how it's all done. You get access to music\nfrom our composer Tom Fox. You get access to my scripts. Like occasionally we do\nQ&As where we get to chat. I do polls where I get story ideas. It's become a really cool\ncommunity of supporters and just a kind of a sounding\nboard for cool ideas. Oh, and here's a big one. We've started publishing\nour videos over on Nebula, which is a creator-owned platform where you can get our videos a week early. There's a link in my description\nthat explains all that. If you wanna support the channel and you're like a production person, then we have LUTS and Presets, which help us color our videos and photos. And if you don't wanna support the channel and you just wanna keep watching, that's fine, too. I'm not here to tell you to give me money. I'm here to make cool stories and I hope that you're\nlearning from these videos and I appreciate you being\nhere in the first place. So, let's raise a glass\nto a wonderful year of learning and growth\nand amazing stories, and look forward to a 2023 that I hope is gonna be full of even more growth. Not only growth in the number\nof people that are here, but also a growth in our desire to like understand this world, to understand the story\nof how we all got here and how it works today. I will continue to be\nthe curious storyteller who tries to bring those stories to you in the best way possible. I appreciate all of those\nwho are here supporting, and cheers to a great 2023 of curiosity and a lot of maps. Bye everyone. (light upbeat music) (gentle music)"

    "captions": "(soldiers speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) - [Johnny] There are bunkers everywhere in this country. - [Radio Controller] Mayday,\nmayday, mayday, slowing down. (radio controller speaking\nfaintly) slowing down. - [Announcer] Nevertheless,\ntheir objective remains the total conquest of all Germany. (bombs exploding) (ominous music)\n(metal clacking) (gentle ominous music) - I'm currently inside\nof the largest bunker in all of Switzerland. It is massive. I mean, look at this place.\n(Johnny chuckles) (gentle ominous music) 30,000 square meters of space, which is 300,000 square feet for those imperial\npeople out there like me. And I'm hanging out with Eric, who currently owns the bunker. - This is where the crew\nwas taking the showers, showering 85 meters of rock above you. - [Johnny] Yeah, it's gotta be one of the deepest showers in the world. He's been showing me giant cannons and the sleeping quarters and the hospital and the giant generators that have provided\nelectricity for this place. - Incredible.\n(gentle ominous music) (switch clicks)\n(metal clinking) - From the outside this thing\ndoes not look big at all. (Johnny laughing) Wow. Look at that. That is amazing. A reminder that every time you see a\nlittle door in the forest that goes into a bunker, it's probably a massive\nnetwork of tunnels. Two meters of concrete\nhere at the entrance. You go inside of this door and you are let into a labyrinth\nof tunnels and weaponry. - [Eric] Eight kilometers of walkways. - [Johnny] Eight kilometers?\n- [Eric] Yeah. - Oh, and with the most gnarly doors you've ever seen in your life. They're quadruple fortified\nwith huge slabs of concrete. - This is like two meters of concrete. It sit behind there with a rifle and be able to protect the entrances. - Wow. No one is getting into\nthis bunker anytime soon. (gentle plucky music) I went to Switzerland to hunt for bunkers. Fortresses drilled impossibly\ndeep into mountains and cliffs and villages hidden from view, but packing deadly power. Oh, wow. I've seen so many bunkers. You don't have to look\nsuper hard to find them. They're everywhere. There's a bunker right here, look at this. This is not a rock. (metal clanking)\nThis is a door. (birds tweeting) These little doors in\nthe middle of the forest, so unassuming, so benign, but boy, if you knew what was inside. Let's be clear, this isn't normal. Most countries don't bore into mountains as their defense strategy, but Switzerland isn't\nlike other countries. - When you live in Switzerland, you never really have a sense of threat. We're Switzerland, we're neutral, right? Nothing gonna happen to us. (ominous music) - So instead of forming alliances and sending troops they dug. And the results are nearly 10,000 of these scattered all throughout the country. And that is what I have\nbeen searching for. (drone whirring) Okay, okay, okay. Where are you, my bunkers?\nWhere are you, my bunkers? Ah, I see something down there. That is not natural erosion on this cliff. I keep looking for more\nand more and I'm realizing, there are too many for me to fly to. Like, there are dozens up there. This cliff is just riddled\nwith little windows, totally primed and prepped to just light up this entire valley if there was an invading\narmy from the north. Oh, and it's not just the mountains. I also discovered hundreds\nof thousands of bunkers dug under Swiss homes, a further expression of\nthe Swiss habit of digging to remain neutral. The bunkers are at the\ncenter of a discussion that is heating up as the\nworld becomes dangerous again. So Switzerland is once again debating what these bunkers mean to them and what it means to be safe, secure, and neutral in a changing world. (upbeat ominous music) (static sizzles) (bells clanking) (cows mooing) Okay wait, before we continue this story, I need to tell you about today's sponsor, as we look at the beautiful\nSwiss countryside. Today's sponsor is NordVPN, which is a longtime\nsupporter of this channel and I'm very grateful for that. I have been here in Switzerland traveling. And when I travel, my computer and all of my\naccounts kind of freak out because they think I'm like someone logging\ninto all of my accounts from a different country, but it's really just me. So what I do is I click one\nbutton and I log on to NordVPN, and it connects me to the\ninternet via the United States. So all of my accounts work nicely. This is a big deal if you've ever been in the death loop of two-factor\nauthentication like, can't send you a text message 'cause you're in a\ndifferent country anyway. That is just one use case. NordVPN can be used for a million things. Not only can you connect to the internet via the UK and watch Netflix UK, being connected to the internet is becoming like a minefield\nof different threats. Whether it's like phishing or\nyour password getting stolen or just malicious trackers, the internet is not as\nsafe as it used to be. I love this because it just\noperates in the background, it's one button, you click it,\nit just does all the things. And right now they have a\n30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't like it, you can get all your\nmoney back within 30 days. So go click the link in my description. It's nordvpn.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gets you in on an exclusive deal that\nis happening right now where you get four months\nof NordVPN for free. Thank you NordVPN for\nsponsoring this video and making it possible for me to come here and make this in-depth piece on bunkers. It's like a dream come true. Okay, I'm gonna get back to the road. (air whooshing)\n(gentle suspenseful music) I'm on top of a mountain\noverlooking a stunning view, but I'm looking for a bunker up here. It's on the wall of this cliff. I think I need to fly\nthe drone to find it, but it's raining. That's a problem. The fog's rolling in, I gotta be quick. (plastic clicking) Okay, up on the side of this cliff. I know there's a bunker nearby. (foliage rustling) Oh god. Jesus. (foliage rustling) (beep) Okay, that was too close. (gentle suspenseful music) All right, I think this\nis my takeoff point. (drone beeping)\n(drone whirring) Oh yeah, I see bunkers. I see bunkers. Oh, boy. (chuckling) Just blending into the\nside of this mountain. Oh my god, look at this. (suspenseful music) I mean, just looking at these bunkers, you start to realize how incredibly ambitious of a feat this is to drill into the side of a cliff and decide to build an\nentire network of tunnels that are connected and well\narmed and strategically placed so that you can hit the\ntargets you want to hit. Oh, look, there's another one. Oh my god, look at this. That is just at the base of this cliff. Oh my goodness, and it's hidden. The only reason I can see\nit is because I am above it, but if you're looking at it\nstraight on, you don't see it. It blends in perfectly. Look at that. There's one behind all\nof these little facades. They're just guns that are\nhiding in the wall of this cliff. (gentle pulsing music) (Johnny exhales) Okay, onto the next bunker. (bright twinkly music) (wind whipping)\n(bright twinkly music) By the 1800s, the Swiss were really good\nat digging into mountains, building cable cars, trains. They just, they got really good. And that prowess for digging became incredibly useful in the 1940s when their situation looked like this. Surrounded by fascist regimes that are quickly taking over\nEurope very effectively, these two allies, Italy and Germany, with Switzerland kind of\nsandwiched right in the middle. Neutral Switzerland wanted\nto stay out of the war. So they did whatever it took. But one of the major things they did when they wanted to stay neutral,\nwas they started digging. (dramatic pulsing music) They turned their mountains\ninto a literal giant fortress. Yes, you heard me right. They turned their\nmountains into a fortress, or I guess technically if you're a military nerd, a redoubt. Redoubt just means, basically an impenetrable fortress that is dug into the ground, but redoubts usually look\nlike this, one fortress. Switzerland wanted to turn\ntheir entire Alpine region, which is a huge part of their\ncountry, into a giant redoubt. I'm gonna explain to you the\nstrategy in just a second, what the thinking was here, because it's a little paradoxical and weird and war is weird, but the point is here that they started digging and digging, and started creating what\none historian has called the biggest fortress in Europe. (dramatic techno music) (air whooshing) (camera shutter clicking) (wind whistling) (dramatic techno music) I'm at the base of the\nSwiss Alps right now and I'm in a village\nthat is very Switzerland. It's got a lot of grass\nand cows and barns, but a few of these barns\nlike this one behind me, have a little secret inside. (bells clanging) - Now, it lights up, and then opens. - Wow. (laughs) What? This gun is massive. It has a range of 21 kilometers. (Johnny laughs) And this is just one of four barn bunkers that are all connected to\neach other in this village. - [Owner] We're going down here. - [Johnny] So now we're in the tunnels. Oh my gosh, wow. - [Owner] Oh, yes. - So we're just walking under the green grass and the cows right now? - [Owner] Exactly. (suspenseful music) - [Johnny] Oh my goodness. - [Owner] And the grenades. This 10.5 centimeter grenades. (metal scraping) You have to use this shell for (shell clunks) And the explosion sinks in and the whole thing looks like that, huh? - [Johnny] Oh, it's a good giant bullet. - Yeah. First grenade in\nand then the shelve in. (bombs exploding) Shows to the people that\nthey have to be quiet to protect all our army secrets. A lot of people and the\nsoldier say, \"Hey, keep quiet.\" All top secret. (gentle music) (foliage rustling) (gentle music) - Switzerland turning their\ncountry into a giant fortress was basically made possible because of these giant natural\nwalls that they already have. If you're an invading army, you can't get a bunch of\nmen over these mountains, but these walls had gates in them. Those gates are called mountain passes. And when you're not in wartime, mountain passes are actually really good. Do you see that bridge behind me? That bridge has been used for a long time to let people flow throughout this pass, but if you're Switzerland in 1942, these gateways through the Alps that have been used for\ntrade are now a liability. They're now a gateway for invading armies to come take over your country. (motorcycle engine revving)\n(indistinct chattering) So this is where they\nfocus their attention. All these choke points, all of these gateways to their mountains. The idea was if the Italians\nstart coming from that way or the Germans start coming from that way they can sit in their bunkers and blow the smithereens out\nof anyone coming up this pass. Because again, it's a choke point. No one can go anywhere else. You can't go over the mountains. You have to go through this pass. (gentle music) (dramatic techno music) (car engine revving) All right, I'm down from the\nmountains for a little bit and it's because I got invited\nto hang out with this guy. He's a retired Swiss historian who's freaking obsessed\nwith maps of Switzerland. I've never felt so seen in my life. - I'm a an artillery gunner. I did my basic training in a fortress. And then we went here just for training. Zurich in the pre Alps. - He's showing me with\nthis amazing 3D relief map what this fortress actually looked like. - Here in these high mountains, were several very very\nimportant fortresses. Some here, there were old\nones and some modern new ones. Here, here, and even here. Here there are bankers\nand there is Toblerone. Do you understand?\n- Yes. I saw the Toblerone on the summer the Southern-\n- Toblerone. There is a last Toblerone\nand also here is one. When France was defeated\nin the summer 1940, Switzerland was surrounded by the axis. This was let's say, an emergency solution. This was to redoubt. (gentle ominous music) - Okay, so I hike up to this Swiss house in the middle of the Pass. Looks like just a normal\nSwiss house, is beautiful, but you look closely\nand you see something. These windows aren't real\nwindows they're painted on. This thing is actually solid concrete. This is not a chalet. These are not like barn doors. Oh wait, are they gonna let me do this? Oh my God. Oh my (laughs) God. Look at this. Those are just little gun holes. Put your gun through that\nthing and you can shoot. (laughs) Oh wow, look at that. This house is not just a house\nwith some gun holes in it. It's actually a network of tunnels. Hey, check this out. I found a fake rock with a gun in it. (Johnny laughs) I was looking at this rock\nand it looked a little weird, a little off up close. It looks like a real rock. It's not. Look under. Yep. Oh yeah. Boom, I see your secrets. I've looked at enough bunkers\nto know what the playbook is. Hide something either in a\nvillage or in a mountain. Put a huge network of tunnels under it and just point at the Pass\n(guns firing) and get ready to fire in\ncase there's an invasion. (gentle ominous music) But wait a minute, let's\nexamine the logic here. Yeah, it's really cool to have mountains full of really protective\nbunkers, really cool, but most people in Switzerland\ndo not live in the mountains. Most people live up here\non this flat plateau and in their early 1940s,\nthey were sitting ducks. The point here was not to\nprotect the people directly but rather to signal\nto Hitler and Mussolini that if they wanted to\nconnect their two empires they would have to go through the Alps and that that would be incredibly costly and basically impossible. It's like using defense as the deterrent. Oh, and it worked. The Nazis had a plan all fleshed\nout to invade Switzerland but they never did it. And yes, that is not just\nbecause of these bunkers. It is because Switzerland was\nletting the Nazis store money and stolen stuff in their banks, trading with them et cetera. The bunkers were a part\nof the deterrent strategy, but the Swiss really paned to the Nazis as another form of staying neutral, something they hear a lot\nabout even 70 years later. (gentle music) I'm at a dam and if my intel is right that big giant mountain behind\nme is actually a bunker. (drone whirring) And away. (dramatic music) I don't see anything. Wait a minute, yes I do. What is that? What is that? I see you big boy. You are a very well hidden gun. Wow. That thing blends in very nicely. With that as their fortress, no one can fire back. (dramatic music) Another hidden bunker, another\nsuccessful drone flight. Nice job drone. Let's get outta here. Onto the next one. (bright twinkly music) I hear there's a tunnel up there at the top of that mountain, that foggy, foggy, wet mountain. Three and a half kilometers. I can do this. Let's go. (bright twinkly music) By the way, big thanks to the subscriber who recommended this bunker to me. I put a call out to ask Swiss people what bunkers I should go hunting for, and this is one of them. (bright twinkly music) (Johnny exhales sharply) (bright twinkly music) Wow. (gentle suspenseful music) So yeah, Hitler never invaded, Switzerland stayed neutral in the war, but eventually the Swiss\ngovernment was like, \"Why are we paying for a bunch of bunkers \"that we designed for Hitler?\" So they decided to decommission them. (gentle suspenseful music) A lot of them are totally abandoned, but then you have private buyers, people who have bought them to turn them into whatever they want. A lot of these are museums or are owned by like\nmilitary organizations that wanna preserve the history, but some people get really\ncreative with these bunkers. Like people are growing mushrooms and fermenting cheese in them, or perhaps my favorite use\nthe place I slept last night. (gentle music) This is my hotel tonight. (gentle music) I booked this hotel because I'm making a story about bunkers. And so I was like, \"I have\nto stay in a bunker hotel.\" I had no idea it was gonna be this. This is a full blown deep\nin the mountain bunker. There's dripping water everywhere. Original ladders. This place is nuts. (gentle music) Okay, I guess I'm gonna go\nget dinner in this bunker. There's a restaurant in it. I'm going there now. (gentle music) What is happening? (gentle music) - [Announcer] Switzerland is\none of the beautiful countries in the world. This small countries\nsurrounded by powerful nations has been able to remain\nneutral for the past 150 years. 150 years, 150 years. (bright twinkly music) - And I'm back in the city and I need to tell you\nthe next part of the story because this is where it\nbecomes relevant to today. - [Announcer] The Swiss\npeople have always been ready to protect their country. - After the bunker digging\nstrategy worked in World War II to keep Switzerland neutral, they kind of latched onto the idea, digging bunkers worked and they\nweren't gonna stop doing it but the Nazi threat went away and was replaced with a new threat. One that would not be deterred by turning your mountains\ninto a giant fortress (bright twinkly music) (military air raid sirens) - [Announcer] That signal means to stop whatever you are doing and get to the nearest safe place fast. - [Announcer] It is called a\nCold War because armed forces, although used as a threat,\nare rarely unleashed. - While the rest of the world\nwas busy making alliances and arming themselves, the Swiss turned to their\ngood old strategy of digging, but instead of focusing on the mountains they turned to the city. I've been hanging out with Robin, a Swiss journalist who's\nbeen showing me around the non-mountain version of Swiss bunkers. - So this is like a normal basement usually in a Swiss house. And then behind here you\nmostly have this thick door, is really nothing special,\nit's just a regular seller. What we do as Swiss people,\nwe store golf clubs, we store skis, wine, but of\ncourse with a special window, with a special filter. So we close this. - [Johnny] Oh my gosh. - Yep. Like this. - [Johnny] Yep. Wow. - And then like this. - It's gotta be funny that\nAmerican comes to town and is like, \"Look at these bunkers.\" And you're just like- - \"No Johnny, it's just a seller.\" (both laughing)\n- It's a seller. There's nothing special. And I'm like, \"But the door is so thick.\" So you're Switzerland in the 1950s your big alpine fortress\ndigging bunkers thing worked. And you're like, \"Let's make everyone have\na bunker in their house \"so that we can be protected\nagainst nuclear apocalypse.\" Okay, cool idea in theory. In practice, incredibly\nimpractical and very expensive. So they did what they do for just about everything in Switzerland, they put it to a vote. (gentle ominous music) And so in the '60s they\ndecreed bunkers as a right. They actually lined out\nexactly how to build bunkers. They required everyone to build them either retroactively or\nin their new buildings. And the Swiss government would pay like 70% of the cost for these bunkers. The people would be protected using the same strategy\nthat they've always used, digging holes. (dramatic pulsing music) So I went to the factory of\na company that makes bunkers the beds and the dry toilets\nand the air ventilation. I feel like I'm wandering through the Ikea for bomb shelters. (laughs) (dramatic pulsing music) And perhaps my favorite,\nthese giant doors. Oh my god, these giant doors. I've fallen in love with these doors. I don't know why. They're just large. They're really fun to push and pull and they're just kind of cartoonish because they're so freaking thick. Oh my god, look at that door. Oh my god, look at this thing. Oh yeah, wow. - It's nothing- - This is nothing special. - No. No.\n(both laughing) - Oh, and they always have\nlike this yellow wrench that I've become very attached\nto, the yellow wrench. Oh, you see a yellow wrench\nand there's a bunker. It's like safety or something. I don't know. Can I buy one of these as a souvenir? I've wanted one forever. Oh my goodness. I have a yellow wrench. I've always wanted one. Thank you. The bunker industry's been slowing down since the end of the Cold\nWar, for obvious reasons. And it's no longer required\nby the building code for new houses to have a bunker. But unfortunately the Swiss bunker is now getting a new wave of attention. (journalist speaking in foreign language) (journalist speaking in foreign language) - [Journalist] As the\nassault closes in on Kyiv, two and a half million civilians are suddenly on the front line. - Putin's invasion of Ukraine\nis changing everything. The fear and the risk of having to use a bunker\nlike this is increasing. - It's crazy. I mean,\nwhen the war started, I've got phone calls and emails daily. Interesting, mainly from Germans,\n90% of Germans would call. In Switzerland We have 11 million more than there are people\nunderground nuclear shelters and Germany there's zero. So I got calls daily\nfrom people from Germany, \"Can I rent a room here.\" (speaking in foreign language) - People are thinking\nabout their bunkers again. The government is inspecting them making sure they have enough. (speaking in foreign language) I'm in a giant neighborhood bunker that is for anyone on this\nneighborhood block to come to in case of an emergency. It's fully decked out as expected, and it even has a\nfull-blown operating room and a room for dead bodies. (gentle suspenseful music) Like that's what that is back there. (gentle suspenseful music) Putin's invasion of\nUkraine changed everything for a lot of places in the world, but here in Switzerland it didn't only change how people think about bunkers and physical safety, but it also kicked off a debate about the complex topic\nof Swiss neutrality. - The Swiss government says it is adopting the EU sanctions package on Russia. That's a huge move. - This is Switzerland. Who may I remind you did not take a side when they came to Hitler. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Swiss president, Ignazio Cassis, said, \"Extraordinary times called\nfor extraordinary measures.\" - Joining in on sanctions\nfor a lot of people is a massive violation of the thing that has kept them neutral and peaceful for like 200 years. (speaking in foreign language) - Several parties saying, \"well, we should be more flexible.\" More traditional party saying \"Well, neutrality means\nnot doing anything, \"not joining any party,\nnot helping anything, \"but rather offer (speaking\nin foreign language).\" I don't how you say... (bright twinkly music) - Now, we took over the\nsanctions from the EU which basically makes us a war party. Well, I don't like it. I\ndon't think it's right. - If you're from a country\nthat isn't obsessively neutral you're kind of like, \"Dude,\nyou gotta take a stance.\" But here they think differently\nabout the right side and the cost of choosing\na side in conflict or more importantly, the\nbenefit of not choosing a side. - I think the Swiss, the people themselves want\nneutrality which we never know. I mean, the majority rules. It's democracy. (bright twinkly music) - Okay, well, that's it. That is my journey. I have to say, this story left\na bit of an impression on me. I came here thinking I\nwas gonna go hiking around and stumble upon some abandoned\nbunkers in the forest, but as I dug into this, I found myself understanding\nSwitzerland in a new way. This place where the people\ndidn't colonize other countries but stayed here digging in their mountains so obsessively to defend\ntheir ideas about neutrality. A neutrality that is finding new meaning in a changing world. Thanks for watching. (bright twinkly music) Hey, so I filmed so much more\nthan was put into this video. Boy, the work has just begun. Oh, I'm the drone. It's kind of scaring me right now. (upbeat music) It's old, it's kind of broken,\nit's not as good and... (metal clinking) (upbeat music) I used to hear a lot about the American... Oh, shit. (beep) This is what it takes to get a bunker. Oh, (beep) Okay, I gotta go find that drone. It's almost a travesty. So much so that I'm finally done not doing behind the scenes. I'm gonna start putting a\nbunch of BTS up on Patreon. Patreon is a place that\nI turn to for support in a world where I'm trying to do deeper more factually correct journalism that is expensive and time consuming. So over on Patreon I'm\ngonna start to publish behind the scene vlogs or show you how all this stuff is made. I'm also gonna publish a full version of this tour that I did\nthrough Eric's Bunker. It's way longer and way cooler than the two seconds I was\nable to put in this video. And going forward I'll be doing behind the scenes stuff from the studio and from my other travels so that you can see how this is made. You've been asking for it for a long time. I've been resisting for some reason. I'm done resisting. Go become a Patreon and help\nsupport independent journalism. If you wanna support in other ways, there's lots in presets\nthat are in the description. And thank you Switzerland\nfor another amazing trip. I'll see you soon. (gentle ominous music)"

    "title": "Why Recessions Happen",
    "video_id": "EhyOQ0QMINg",
    "captions": "- One, two, three, four, five. Hello, hello, hello. Okay, here we go. I wanna explain to you\nwhat a recession is. I'm doing this because\nyou're gonna hear this word a lot lately. And depending on how bad it gets, you'll likely feel its effects. So give me 12 minutes\nto explain recession. Plus, of course, the inevitable time it\ntakes me to read an ad, which is something I must do in order to pay my employees\nand feed my children. I'm sure you can understand. I spent four years in\nuniversity studying economics preparing for this very\nmoment, so let's go. - Are we at a turning point\nheaded for a recession? - Storm clouds of recession looming and the storm is really coming. - With inflation at a 40-year high, many experts warn of a\npossible economic slow down. - A recession is almost inevitable. We use the word \"economy\" to summarize what is\nliterally billions of things. Billions of people making\nbillions of decisions all connected to each other, and yet the result of\nall of these decisions is one of two things, this line either going up or going down. (ominous music) This all-encompassing number on a graph is called the gross domestic product, GDP, which, by the way, is kind\nof the most undescriptive, useless title ever given to anything. GDP is like the receipt of an economy. Every single thing that was\nmade and sold in an economy all added up into one giant number. Now there's a very technical definition that you can go explore in the sources if you're that kind of person, but for now, just imagine every TV and piano lesson and slice\nof pizza and car wash and pair of shoes and\nsmartphone and video game, everything that the people purchased from the businesses in\nyour economy in one year all added up and packed into this one dot and plopped on a graph. So what we're looking at here\nis Britain's GDP in 1990. Everything that the economy made and sold to the people added up to\nabout a trillion pounds. That was their GDP for that year. This is the best way that we can summarize how big an economy is,\nhow much it produces, how well it's performing year after year. Let's look at a graph. This is what GDP looked\nlike in the old days, like in the agrarian days. You had ups and downs year by year, but really, overall, this\ngraph is pretty flat. The economy didn't really\nhave an upward trend. It wasn't growing. That's because back in the 1300s the economy was a\ncompletely different world than what we live in today. It was pegged to things like farming, which was pegged to things\nlike weather or plague or war. So like here's the Black Death that killed 40% of Europe's population, and here is the Great Frost, a weather event that\nruined a bunch of crops and therefore made the\neconomy shrink for a year. Okay, so this is how it\nwas in the agrarian days, but brace yourself for what happens next. (upbeat music) This flat line just\nturned into a steep cliff, and that's because humans\nstarted doing science, not just to make themselves smarter, but because they were incentivized to, to make more stuff to,\nmake it more efficiently. All of this happening as\nhumans were developing and spreading a new set of economic rules, rules that rewarded those who invented, produced, and sold stuff\nthat made life better for both the buyer and the seller. The system was called capitalism. Capitalism plus industry was the cocktail that\nallowed this to happen. By the way, pause the timer for a second because I need to just say it is painful how little I'm able to\ninclude on this topic. Go into the sources and just poke around and you'll see so much good juicy history on capitalism and the\nIndustrial Revolution. Let's move on. Back to the timer. So every year people could\nmake more and more stuff. They could sell more stuff. And there was more and more GDP, more stuff being made\nand sold in the economy, not just in England, which is this graph we've\nbeen using as the example, but eventually in the whole world. Okay, but there was a\ncatch to this new system. Unlike the old agrarian days where you could have a graph that kind of stays\ngenerally flat over time, this new system was built off of the idea that the line kind of has to go up. Capitalism works because\nit incentivizes people to make products and\nbusinesses that are better and better every year,\nmore and more productive, pushing this line higher\nand higher every year. And the kind of voodoo\nmagic of capitalism is if the line doesn't go\nup, bad things happen. (dramatic music) Okay, so here's where\nit all comes together. We're trying to get to recession right? By the mid 1800, the capitalist experiment\nwas fully underway, at least in the western world and Japan. The rest of the world was\nbeing brutally exploited to make all of this happen. Anyway, topic of another story. See How Europe Stole the\nWorld, part one and two, part three coming soon. (exhales) The amount of\nstuff being made and sold in the economy was going up\nmore and more every year. This graph is definitely going\nup, but what about all these? Soon a mysterious pattern\nemerged in this line. Every few years the\nGDP graph would go down for a little bit. The amount of stuff being\nmade and sold would shrink, not necessarily tied to\nweather and war and plague, but just cause. Before eventually recovering and continuing on its way up. And these little dips in\nthe line we call recession, a receding of the amount of\nshit we can make and sell. Here is the GDP of the\nUnited States since 1948 and here are all the recessions. There've been like 12. I mean, we just got out of one of these. We had a very short but dramatic recession thanks to COVID-19. But the last long recession was back here, the financial crisis around 2008 the one that you probably think of when you hear the word recession. - Subprime derivative. - A subprime mortgage meltdown. - A housing bubble. - Okay, wait, wait, wait. But why does the graph go\ndown in the first place? Like what makes it go down? You can't answer that by\nlooking at just this big line. You have to zoom into one of these dots and see what has to happen\nto create this number. (upbeat music) At the very heart of\nthe capitalist economy you have two major players. You've got people and businesses, or as economists like to call\nit, households and firms. In this case, let's just say the entire economy of your country is actually the size of your neighborhood, and you're going to your local bakery, an important business in\nyour neighborhood economy. You and your neighbors\nshow up to this bakery and you pay $3 for a loaf of bread. The bakery is a business\nthat uses that money to pay its workers, but these workers aren't like\nsome special class of people. They're just other people in the economy who also are gonna go spend money too. The bakery also has to\npay rent to a landlord who's also just another\nperson in the neighborhood. So those people then go off with their new money\nthat they just got paid and they spend on other businesses who also have workers\nto pay and rent to pay. And suddenly your money is flowing to all the people who work in the economy, and everyone's feeling good about it. They have jobs, they have a solid income, they can buy cool stuff. The bakery and other\nneighborhood businesses feel this demand and they go, \"we need to hire more people\nso we can make more bread.\" And lucky for them, there are investors, and the investors are\nstoked on all of this demand so they start investing in the bakery and all the other businesses, giving them money to hire more people, to make more bread,\nmore buying, more jobs, more stuff being added to the total. The GDP is going up,\nthe economy is growing. Okay, but what happens when\nsome outside force comes in to disrupt all these good vibes? It all starts when you show\nup to your bakery one day and you notice that something changed. Suddenly the price of a loaf\nof bread is actually $4. And the baker's like, \"Sorry, dude! The price\nof flour has gone up.\" You know, inflation,\nsupply chains, whatever. They say something. But the point is what it does to you. Suddenly you're feeling like, oh, maybe I can't afford this bread. Or even if you can, you\nsee that something's up or maybe you hear that the\ninterest rate is going up, something that we're\nhearing about a lot lately. And so now you're thinking, oh, maybe I shouldn't spend money\non expensive artisan bread but save that money and I can\nactually get a good return. If you're an investor, the higher interest rate's\nkind of freaking you out because now it's more\nexpensive to borrow money. You think twice before\ninvesting in the bakery. Another option is that\nyou're hearing rumors about a coming economic downturn because of some war somewhere, and you judge that it would\nbe wise to save your dollars instead of spend on expensive\nartisan bread or whatever. Meanwhile, your neighbors are seeing and feeling the same things, and they decide that this bread is a little bit too expensive for them and they'll just make bread at home. Less bread is demanded\nfrom the bakery, AKA, there's a disruption in\nyour local bread market, AKA, there's a mismatch\nbetween bread demanded and bread supplied. The bakery hired too many\nworkers during the good times. They now don't have the\nrevenue to pay them all, so they have to lay some of\nthem off or cut their pay. Unemployment is now going up. \"I lost my job today,\" says your sad looking\nneighbor one evening, which kind of freaks you out even more. Maybe you should be more\ncareful about your spending. And now it's starting to spread. What was just a decision\nto not buy bread anymore means that many employees in\nthe neighborhood won't get paid and now they can't go out and spend money, which means that other\nbusinesses have less revenue to pay their employees, and now more people are hearing about this and deciding maybe they\ndon't wanna be spending, and suddenly there are fewer\nand fewer transactions, less lending and investment. And now this economy that was\nonce buzzing with activity is experiencing a domino effect. Less stuff is being made,\nless stuff is being bought. Your neighborhood economy\nis literally shrinking. It's making less stuff. Your GDP is lower than\nit was the year before. Your neighborhood is in recession. The point I wanna make here\nis that this is the result of loads and loads of people making a bunch of micro-decisions on whether or not to spend their money. And because of the system we're in, these decisions have a\nmassive chain reaction that affects everyone who participates in the economy, meaning everyone. That's the blessing and\nthe curse of capitalism. Okay, let's just pull\nourselves out of the analogy with all the pretty animation and talk about the real\nworld for a second. You're probably wondering, are\nwe in a recession right now? Are people spending less money so that the economy makes less stuff? Is GDP doing this? I mean, maybe! We don't know yet! And especially with this one,\nit's kind of a weird one. It's hard to tell. We're getting contradictory\nsignals from the economy. Here in the United States we had two quarters in a row, which is like six months,\nof a shrinking GDP, and this, for a lot of analysts, is the definition of a recession. Two quarters in a row of\nshrinkage? We're in a recession. But then just a few weeks\nago, the news came out that the third quarter of\n2022, the economy grew again. I mean it was by less\nthan 1%, but it grew. So that's not a recession yet. Plus, during a recession, the number of unemployed people spikes. But check out where the\nunemployment rate is right now. It's nice and low. That's not recession. So the signals are contradictory. By the way, if you want a deeper dive into how recessions are\nofficially classified and declared and by whom, check the\nsources in the description. There's a whole super deep dive into that. Most of you would be like\nsnoozing after two seconds if I went into it. What we do know is that people\nare a little bit freaked out. They're being more cautious\nabout their spending, and that's because of a cocktail of causes that you've heard about in the news. COVID-19 giving way to energy prices and supply chain disruptions\nand this war in Ukraine. The result is less of\nthis and more of this, and that's because hundreds\nof millions of people are making hundreds of millions of little micro-decisions\nevery day to spend less money in an economy that only works\nif everyone spends more money and pushes businesses to make more stuff. And that's the point I want to make here. The big takeaway. We talk about the economy like\nit's some kind of science. I mean, I have a degree in\neconomics, a social science. We look at graphs, we do calculus, and we feel like we're scientists. And in a big sense we are. But what this graph hides is that what we're dealing\nwith here are people, people who make decisions\nbased on how they feel, and that's really hard\nto predict and control. We do it. See the inflation video for how the Fed is like a puppet master. We do it, but it's really\nhard to control and predict. So a recession is almost certainly coming. You may be watching\nthis in like nine months and the recession is here. I don't know. The fact is by looking at\nthis line, what we can say is that a recession is natural and normal. It is a part of our\nmodern economic system. It will likely come and then go. People will lose jobs,\nbusinesses will close, and at some point, for a\nmillion tiny little reasons, things like policy and\njust general feelings in a bunch of people's guts,\nthis graph will stop going down and it will start going up again. That we can be sure. (exhales) Do you know what\nelse we can be sure of? I'm gonna keep making videos. And in fact, I have just made one of the most ambitious\nvideos in my entire life. It is about Swiss bunkers. There are bunkers\neverywhere in this country. And the result is this video game (airplane flying) I'm really proud of\nthat publishes next week here on the channel. (energetic music) but I actually published it early. It's available right now. You can go watch it\nliterally like right now. if you go to Nebula. They turned their mountains\ninto a literal giant fortress. Yes, you heard me right. They turned their\nmountains into a fortress. Nebula is a platform where I'm gonna start publishing\nmy videos a week early. You can go watch them\nbefore anyone else does with no ads and no interruptions at all. This is not a rock, this is a door. If you like my videos, you're gonna like the\nstuff that's on Nebula. Like this hour and a half long documentary on the Colorado River\nby Wendover Productions. It's insanely well produced. RealLifeLore, a YouTuber I deeply respect, has a \"Modern Conflicts\" series that is only available on Nebula. Can't get it anywhere else. In addition to tons more smart creators. It seriously seems too good to be true. So how much is this gonna cost you? That's what you're all asking. Well, if you go in through the front door, just like go to Nebula and sign up, it's five bucks a month or $50 a year. But there's a hack for this\nthat makes it way cheap, like ridiculously cheaper, like less than a dollar a month. Click the link in my description and it'll take you to Curiosity Stream. Curiosity Stream is a partner of Nebula and they have this bundle deal right now where if you sign up for Curiosity Stream and you use my code, johnnyharris, make sure to use the code\nto support my channel. Choose literally the cheapest plan. It is less than a dollar a month\nif you do the annual thing. It doesn't say it here, like it literally doesn't say it anywhere, but if you do this plan and you enter my code\nwhen you're checking out, you will get an email from Nebula that says your Nebula\naccount has been activated, create a password. And now you get to watch\nmy videos a week early, ad free, and tons of other\namazing ad-free content, a lot of it exclusive to Nebula. Doesn't exist anywhere else. Curiosity Stream is full of its own amazing repository\nof documentaries. But I'm telling you how to get into Nebula for a dollar a month so you can watch my videos a week early. More than any other ad\nread I have ever done, I can say without a doubt that clicking that link\nand using that code, johnnyharris, helps support this channel. And it also helps support\nindependent YouTubers who are trying to make really good stuff. If enough people sign up\nfor Nebula using my link, they are going to help support a big ambitious documentary\nproject I wanna work on. It's a documentary project I can't really publish here on YouTube 'cause I have to play by sort\nof the ad-friendly guidelines, I have to play the attention economy game. I love that, that's fine. But Nebula wants to support me making more and more ambitious stuff. You signing up gets you\naccess to all this stuff but also helps support\nus make great stuff. So anyway, literally just\nchoose any Curiosity Stream plan and use my code, and that's it. It's late. It's getting dark out there. Hope everyone's having a good winter. And I'm tired. It's a Friday today. You're probably watching\nthis on some other day, but I'm gonna go home and take a nap. (energetic music)"

(cork popping) - [Reporter] Cryptocurrency\nis going mainstream. - [Matt Damon] Fortune favors the brave. - [Reporter] Crypto.com overnight. - And then they did. - It's been a brutal week\nfor crypto investors. Founder and CEO Sam\nBankman-Fried has announced his official resignation. (man screaming) - Not only did all these\ngraphs go down, but one of the largest crypto platforms\nwent bust when we discovered that the founder was using\ntons of investors money to fund his other company\nand not telling anyone. Totally not okay. - [Newscaster] Crypto exchange FTX files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy today. - [Reporter] It's safe to say there were red flags all over the play. - As of last week it\nwas worth $32 billion. - Surely it had to be some sort of scam. - This is why you're\nseeing this guy's face all over the news lately. He literally lost like\nover $10 billion overnight. - So now I feel a bit vindicated. - While all of this\nturmoil has been going down crypto actually had a huge win lately. Something that no one's\nreally talking about. - [Reporter] Waiting for the Merge. - [Announcer] The Merge\n- [Commentator] The Merge merge.\n- They really solved one of their biggest problems. So that's what I wanna focus on today. So what happened? And is it enough to save the cryptoverse? (hands clapping)\nLet's do this. - [Reporter] The merge is\nperhaps the most important update in Ethereum's history. - Can you explain it to everyone? - This is the biggest\ndevelopment in the crypto space. - [Announcer] Crypto's most\nambitious change to date. - Hey, before we go on,\nI need to pay my bills and thank today's sponsor. Cut now to that, please. Boy, do we have something\ngood in store today. I'm not gonna spoil it but just say it took an\nentire day to film this video.

All right, let's get\ninto this crypto video. We've got a lot to cover. Okay, so before we get into\nwhat changed in the crypto verse which is a very big deal,\nlet's do a little refresher for those who need it. This time with a little bit of a spin. Hold on a second. (percussion music) Welcome to crypto 102. This is really (beep) stupid. Why am I doing this? Every time I have to\nexplain the blockchain to people I have to do\nsome gimmick to be like, \"I'm gonna teach you the blockchain \"using the simplest version.\" No, I'm done. I'm not doing it, (beep) the blockchain. Let's do this. If you wanna understand\nwhy internet money is making the ocean rise all you really have to understand is this. This is a crypto mining farm. It is a warehouse full of specialized computers that have one job and one job only, solving math problems. (indistinct) These things are all over the world. Hell, I was in a Swiss\nbunker a couple weeks ago and the guy I was interviewing\nhad one of these things. - I am mining Bitcoin at the same time. - [Johnny] Yeah, yeah. - Is this just another way for me to slip Switzerland into a video that's completely unrelated? It totally is. Any chance I have, I will\nmention my favorite country. Anyway, these machines all over the world are sitting here racing against each other to solve a\ncomplicated math puzzle first. And if you're the lucky\ncomputer that solves one of these complicated\npuzzles, you win the race. And that allows you to\nverify what's called a block which is just a little box of data. On the Bitcoin blockchain, for example, this block is only one megabyte of data. It's just big enough to hold like 2000 transactions\nthat people have made with their cryptocurrency. As you publicly verify\nthis block of transactions it gets added to a long chain of a bunch of other blocks\nthat have been verified by the same math puzzle race process and they sort of get strung together into a publicly available,\ntotally verified chain of transactions verified\nby fancy computers that do a bunch of math. It is called a blockchain. Wait, no, I'm not here to\nexplain the blockchain. I'm supposed to be explaining this. So why would a bunch of people\naround the world pay a lot of money to make these big warehouses so that they can verify a math puzzle? Because if you're the\none who owns the computer that successfully solves the math puzzle and verifies the block of\ntransactions, you get rewarded. In the case of Bitcoin right\nnow, you'd get 6.25 bitcoins. Which is like, I don't know,\nnothing more than $125,000. (cash register ringing) So yeah, there's a huge\nincentive for people to build these things and\nto mine all day for Bitcoin. Anyway, this race to\ncomplete math problems uses up a lot of processing\npower, a lot of energy. It takes a whole lot of work\nfor your computer to run through all of these\ncomputations trying to figure out what the answer is and that's why this method\nis called Proof of Work. Every computer that\nverifies the transactions on the blockchain has to do a lot of work. This is all well and cute until you think through\nall the energy that goes into building these\nmachines, and then you think of the electricity it takes\nto run them day and night and then you remember that\nthey get really hot when they're running all the time\ndoing these computations. So you need to cool\nthem down with AC units. - Let's all cool down. - And then remember that\nmost of the electricity we use today comes from\nburning hydrocarbons which releases a nice thick blanket of CO2 into the atmosphere that warms the planet and contributes to the\nongoing global warming crisis. (bomb exploding) So yeah, that's how the math\nmoney makes the ocean rise. But that problem may\nhave just been solved. - [Reporter] Ethereum pulls off the Merge. - Ethereum just got revamped. - The second largest blockchain,\nEthereum which is home to the cryptocurrency\nEther has just completely changed the way that it does\nthe whole crypto electricity math verification thing. This isn't just some\nlike changing the code and hitting update. This verification process\nthat they change is like the beating heart of the blockchain. Switching it out for something new is like switching out the engine of a car while it's hurling down the\nroad at like 120 miles an hour. Insanely difficult to do. So insanely difficult to do\nthat nobody else has ever dared to try it. But Ethereum they were like,\n\"It's worth it for the planet.\" So they start working on this transition for years and years. They're tinkering away. They're testing it,\nthey're perfecting it until September 15th, 2022 when they finally flipped the switch and. (power draining) So what happened? Did it all crash and burn and die and the Ethereum blockchain is no more? Did the car go hurtling off\nthe highway without an engine? (dramatic music) No, actually it went off without a hitch. Which again for me, I'm just\nlike, \"Cool, good job guys.\" But the thing that blew my mind is this. Look at this graph. I mean, look at this graph. This is the energy consumption\nof the Ethereum blockchain. Look at that drop off. We're talking about a 99.5%\ndrop in power consumption for this blockchain. I mean, to give you some context here before this transition,\nwhich they called The Merge the Ethereum blockchain was\nconsuming the same amount of electricity as the country of Chile. It's as if a major developed\ncountry was suddenly taken off the planet's energy bill. The CEO of the Ethereum\nblockchain, claimed that this one software update has reduced global power consumption by 0.2%. Which is just like (imitates explosion). They did this by changing\nfrom the math puzzle race the proof of work race which they had to do to verify\nall all their transactions to a totally different\nsystem called proof of stake. So now instead of having a bunch of computers around the\nworld racing each other all sucking up energy\nto do this big math race now every computer that wants\nto verify a block has to put in a stake, a small amount of cryptocurrency that then puts you in the running to verify a block. Sort of like buying a lottery ticket. - If you wanna win the lottery you have to make the\nmoney to buy a ticket. - Then through a very complex process that I will not go into here, a single random computer is\npicked to verify that block and take home that\nsweet, sweet commission. So no more of these\nbig crypto farms racing against each other to see\nwho can get there first contributing the most processing power. Instead, it's just one computer\ndoing the very light lifting of verifying a block, because\nagain, it was the racing all of these machines working\nsimultaneously that used up the power, not the\nverification process itself. So there you have it. The cryptoverse was saved. The power hungry computers\nwere turned offline. - Shut it down. - And the world energy\nconsumption plummeted all over the globe. The ice caps stopped melting\nand the pollution was reduced to their lowest levels in 40 years. (fist knocking) - Actually, that's not\nwhat happened at all and the cryptoverse is far from saved. - Skeptic Johnny, I didn't\nknow you were gonna be here. I thought you moved to Tampa. - I heard you were making another video so I thought I'd stop by. Can I come in? - I guess? - Okay, good to be back.\n(doorbell ringing) - Crypto Johnny. - Hey, I heard you guys were talking about crypto and I'm here to tell you that the crypto verse\nmight not be totally saved but this is a huge step\nin the right direction. I'm coming in. - Oh gosh, why do crypto\npeople always have to be so polarized? Can't we just stay curious about this new technology\nand just see what happens? - No.\n- No. - Okay, fine. Let's do this again. Can I at least get some Doritos? (bag crinkling)\nOkay. Oh, I thought the video was over. Well then, let's do this. Skeptic Johnny, you start. I honestly wanna hear\nwhat you have to say. I thought that The Merge\nand this huge proof of stake thing was like\na huge win for crypto. So what's your rebuttal? - No, I mean, you're totally right. Having Ethereum switch to\nproof of stake was a huge deal. Is a huge deal. A completely like that graph\nthat you showed earlier. Super impressive. - Thank you, didn't realize\nthis was gonna be so amicable. - But let's be clear that this is just one of a\nmillion problems facing crypto. The crypto space is still rife\nwith scams and volatility. The real reason your\nlittle project hasn't taken off yet is because regular\npeople are way too afraid of losing their money\nwith a cryptocurrency that can be worth $65,000 one month and then a couple months\nlater worth $35,000. - Word. - Wait, what? - No, that happened to me. - What, you invested?\n- After the last video when this guy gave his big\ncrypto sermon I was kind of convinced and things were going well and so I went and I bought\nlike a thousand bucks worth of crypto and now it's worth like 300. - Yeah, case in point,\nyou and like everyone else who dabbled in crypto. - You'll make it all back. You just need to hold. - Okay, but even if he does make it back the volatility of crypto isn't\nactually its biggest problem. - If it's not the environment and it's not the volatility\nwhich I'm concerned about what is it? - This ought to be good. - It turns out that crypto's\nbiggest problem is that guy. - Hey, how's it going guys? - Oh God, not this guy. - Wait, there's more of you? What is this? I don't do this. Who the hell is this guy? - That is Johnny Law and he is hard at work thinking about\nhow to regulate crypto. The real existential threat to crypto right now is not volatility or the environment or\nthe lack of adoption. It is regulators. \u266a Regulators mount up \u266a No one's gonna get that reference unless they had an older brother who was into hip hop in the nineties. - Hey, my brother had that album too. Love Nate Dog. - Before you go into the SEC.\n- Wait, hold on. Let me just finish this\nthought about the government and regulators before you\ncan have your rebuttal. The fact is we did see some\ngovernments embrace crypto. Like the government of El Salvador who like\nmade it legal tender. At that same time other governments were\nshowing what it looks like when you regulate crypto. In China, they've outright banned crypto. You're not allowed to conduct any kind of transactions in or\noutside of the country and you're not even allowed to mine it. Totally banned. - Yeah, that's cool but\nChina still accounts for the second most mining\nactivity in the world. It's almost as if, I don't know the rise of the crypto\nverse is inevitable, okay. Governments be damned. - You may actually get a\nfront row seat to see how unstoppable the crypto verse is because the United States may be next. - No, no, you're getting it all wrong. Me and the USA, we're chill. We love crypto in the U.S. It's all about freedom. It's all about doing what you love, okay. Me and Matt Damon we're like best friends. - Fortune favors the brave. - Yeah, but Matt Damon\ndoesn't pass regulations in the United States. The SEC does. - Mm, wait, wait, I know that one. SEC, Security and Exchange\nCommission, right? - Yes, great work. Real Johnny's real smart. (chips crunching) But yes, that is correct. The SEC is a thing in the United States that is\nmeant to protect investors. - You just don't get it. - I mean, look at this\narticle that I have here from the head of the SEC that wrote it in the Wall Street Journal. - Wait, did you actually\nprint off that paper? - Yes, I printed it out. It helps me read it. I'm dyslexic. Do you have an issue with that? - I didn't say that. - Dude, I'm dyslexic too\nand I love printing things. Especially in big font. - Thank you. Anyway, head of the SEC writing\nin the Wall Street Journal. Guess how many times he\nmentions the environment? I mean, here you look at it.\n- Geez. - Did that article mention anything about the environmental\nconcerns of crypto? - Hold on, I'm checking. - Here, I'll just tell you, it doesn't. The SEC doesn't care\nabout the environment. That's the EPA. The SEC cares about one thing. Protecting Americans from being scammed. So yeah, it is amazing that\nthe Ethereum blockchain was able to get off of its\ninsane energy consumption. That is a great step, but the\ncrypto verse is still riddled with the same old\nproblems it's always had. The problems that the SEC is\nrearing to sort out with a bit of good old regulation. \u266a Regulators \u266a\n- Calls are being renewed for oversight and\nlegislation from Congress. - But wait, they're not gonna\nlike ban crypto in the U.S.? Like this isn't China, right? - Ha, yes, thank you. This is all overblown. - I mean, yeah, they're not\ngonna ban it completely. You're totally right. But they could reclassify crypto as a security instead of a commodity. Right Johnny Law? - I mean, yeah, theoretically they could. - Yeah, I'm gonna be honest. I don't know what that means. - Basically what this means\nis that crypto would now be registered with the SEC. Like Ethereum would have to register Ether and all other applications\nwith the government. - Yeah, that doesn't sound great for the whole untraceable, unregulated crypto utopia philosophy. - No, it doesn't. - Okay, okay. You've talked with all your\nnerdy regulation stuff. This is 100% speculation. There's no proof that they're\nactually gonna do this. And besides, even if they do a regulated but still decentralized\nmonetary system is a lot better than a regulated centralized one like the one that we have with banks. - I am so glad you brought that up. - Oh, this is getting good. - So let's talk about decentralization. It's one of the main pillars of the whole crypto project, right? - Yeah, obviously. - Great, then you'll be interested to know that since they did this big Merge, this big flip to proof of stake almost half of all\ntransactions now happening on the Ethereum blockchain are\ntaking place from two addresses. Only two, two addresses. So much for decentralized. - Yeah, but the fact -\n- Oh wait, I'm not done yet. One sec. I just need to say one more thing which is all of those\nfarms that I'm telling you about that are now like\ndefunct and obsolete. Do you really think those\npeople are just gonna like pack up and go home and be like, \"Well, we have no use\nfor our like hundreds \"of expensive computers and\nmining farms in Iceland?\" No, they're just gonna\nswitch to another blockchain that can use their computers\nto do the same old thing that they've been doing forever,\nwhich is mining blockchain through proof of work. That energy consumption\nisn't disappearing. It's just being transferred. - Holy shit. Sorry, sorry, but a couple\nweeks ago I was in Switzerland. - Is there ever gonna be a video where you don't mention Switzerland? - Seriously, dude? - No, of course not. But anyway, when I was in that\nSwiss bunker, which was right around the time that this\nMerge was happening, it was like the end of September,\nthey told me that they were shutting down their mining operation for a little bit. - [Crypto Miner] Just last week. It says it's not making money right now. So I'll take a break.\n- [Johnny] Yeah. - And it must have been\nbecause of the Merge. - Cool and their next step\nwas to just like destroy all of those really expensive computers and revamp the bunker\nto be some hip Airbnb? Is that what their plan was? - I mean, no, they're\nprobably just looking for like other blockchains to like use all their hardware on. - Yeah, exactly. It was sort of a rhetorical thing. I didn't know you were gonna actually try to answer the question. That was kind of embarrassing. - Okay, I'm gonna cut you off there because it's my turn to speak, okay. You've been just\nblabbering this whole time. So yes, a lot of these miners are moving to other blockchains to\nuse their big mining farms but this is just the beginning. This is early days. Do you realize all\ntechnologies start out clunky? You wanna hear my prediction? The biggest effect isn't\nthe big graph that goes down to zero of all of\nits energy consumption. It's how it's gonna\ninspire other blockchains to do the same thing. To adopt proof of stake. Like imagine if the Bitcoin blockchain adopted proof of stake. It would change the world. It would literally change the world. - But that's never gonna happen. Bitcoin has zero plans to switch to proof of stake or any\nother way of verifying. And unlike Ethereum, which\nis run like a business. They have a CEO that can\nactually make these decisions top down Bitcoin is this\nsuper decentralized project. You would need 51% of the users to all agree to\nswitch something this big. It's not gonna happen anytime soon. - But they might not have a choice. If the rest of this master plan that\nEthereum has goes as smoothly as the Merge, then it's gonna be more of a case of adapt or die. - Wait a plan, what are you talking? - Oh, you haven't heard? The Merge is just the beginning. Oh man, buckle up for this one. After the Merge, we have the Surge then the Verge, then the\nPurge, then the Splurge. - Really, the Splurge? Why do these tech companies\nalways have to come up with these cutesy (beep) naming things? - The Surge is just the next\npart of the master plan. It involves massively scaling\nup the Ethereum blockchain which is way easier to do now that we have proof of stake verification. Okay, so you're probably\nasking what would this scaling up even do? - I actually didn't ask. - It would mean instead of the Ethereum blockchain\nbeing able to perform like 20 transactions per second,\nit would be able to perform over a hundred thousand\ntransactions in a second. Guys, this is huge. Don't even get me started on the Verge. - Yada, yada, yada. I feel like this is just another set of empty words to get people excited so they invest in the math\nmoney project that you're doing. Every time we talk about crypto, it seems like it always goes to this. Some like life changing,\nworld changing technology that's just right around the\ncorner if we all just believe. It just feels like yet another stop along the crypto hype train\nand I'm not here for it. - Okay, okay. I think I'm gonna call it there guys. - But Johnny, I wanted\nto talk about the Verge. - Zip it Crypto Johnny. I'm shutting it down, okay? We've had enough. You can talk about the\nVerge when inevitably I make another one of these\nvideos in like six months. 'Cause apparently that's what I do now. For now, let me just say this. The Merge was indeed an\nincredible technical feat. It was a huge boon for the environment. I mean, that graph is insane. This is gonna be a great thing for the planet no matter what but will it save the cryptoverse alone? Probably not. There are way more trials\nand tribulations to overcome. This technology is barely a decade old. We don't have to have these\nstrong opinions on either side. The reality is none of us\nknow what's gonna happen next. So why don't we all just\nagree to sit back, relax and see what happens next. - Nope, not gonna happen. - He says the same thing every time. \"Let's all hold hands and be friends.\" No.\n- Okay, I'd give up. - Whatever, do you guys wanna\ngo get beer or something? - I've actually been super\ninto hard kombucha lately. - Of course you have. - Yeah, I actually know a\ngreat place down the road. Let's go. - Okay, let's go.\n- Let's do it. (upbeat music)"

    "captions": "(crowd cheering) - [Announcer] And it's a good shot. - We found something in our reporting, something happening here in\nthe one big city in Qatar, a place the whole world\nis looking at right now, (dramatic music) an invisible border drawn\nto trap human beings, to make them work, to make them build. I wanna show this to you. So, let me take you back\nto show you how we ended up sending a camera to someone and teaching them how to\nshoot undercover in Qatar while simultaneously capturing\ninterviews in rural Nepal and how I ended up here staring for hours at maps drawn by the Qatari government, all of this to shine a light on something that Qatar doesn't want the world to see. - [Raj] All of these have\nbeen emptied very recently. (fingers tapping) (mouse clicking) - Hey, I need to show you something. I've been looking at maps of Qatar because the World Cup is going there. When the world is gonna\nbe fixated on one place, you gotta look at all the maps. I've been on the\ngovernment website of Qatar looking at their zoning maps. This is the city of Doha,\nthe capital of Qatar, but look at this. The whole city is yellow, and there's this one little shape of blue, Doha Industrial Area. I know we're talking about zoning. I think something's up here. I've been trying to map this, like, throw it on, like, my\nother tools to map it and see if there's,\nlike, what this could be, and it's not totally making sense. It's kind of cut off from\nthe rest of the city. There's another municipality\nkind of in between it and Doha, but it's a part of Doha. Usually, when you have\nweird zoning like this, there's something going on. Since Qatar got awarded\nthe World Cup in 2010, there's been all sorts of issues with their labor\nconditions and all of that, and I think this has to do with that, but I don't totally know. The World Cup is happening in a few weeks. I wanna go to this place. (camera clicking) I need to reach out to Cammy,\none of our research producers. We're gonna dive into this. We're gonna figure it out. We're going to Doha, folks. Hey Cammy, I wanna go to\nQatar before the World Cup to look at this one part of the city that's completely zoned differently. I think it has to do with,\nlike, the labor situation there. (printer beeping) I can't not print it. (paper rustling) All right, I'm going there. We have to find a fixer, a local producer, someone on the ground who\ncan help us not get arrested. I will follow up tomorrow\nwith more details. Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo. - Hey.\n- Going to Qatar. \u266a Doong, doong, doong, doong,\ndoong, doong, doong, doong \u266a - Johnny, yes, let's do it. This sounds like a really great story, and I'll happily go to Doha with you. I'll start researching right now. - I'm going to Qatar. - Congratulations. I just want you to be smart. - I've been doing some\nresearch, and I don't know how easy it's gonna be\nfor us to film places, especially in the Industrial Area. From what I've read, they're notoriously not very kind to journalists. - The best part about the\nGulf is that these cities are, like, so, like, cartoonish. This is a hotel in freaking Doha. Look at this. Opening later this year. Can I stay in this hotel that looks like a freaking half pipe? I've always wanted to do this. I've never had an excuse. (energetic music) - Doha fixer number one\nreferred me to someone else, so fingers crossed that Doha fixer number\ntwo is gonna work out. - Drones, yes. Do you think they'll let\nme fly my drone in Doha? - No. - [Johnny] Why? - NATO countries are helping\nout doing anti-drone stuff 'cause they're afraid of, you know, terrorist drones coming in so that, like- - [Johnny] Wait, but what\nabout just my DJI drone? - They're sending out anti-drones- - [Johnny] Geez. - to net them.\n(camera clicking) - [Johnny] Wait, what? - Yeah, oh, lemme show you. - Okay, not great news, our\nfixer hasn't found anybody in the Industrial Area\nwho wants to talk with us. It's not looking likely that\nthey're going to find anybody. I'm gonna keep trying to connect\nwith anyone on the ground. - I think it's a hiding people thing. I don't know, but I'm\ntrying to find a fixer to help me get in there. - You're gonna go in there? - Yes. I mean it's just, it's not,\nlike, some secret part- - You're supposed to be leaving in a week, and we haven't found any fixers. We haven't found any people on\nthe ground who could help us. I'm just a bit concerned\nof our timeline right now. (pensive music) - I think we found someone, a fixer who is deeply connected with\nthe worker population in Doha and is potentially gonna help us to get into the Industrial Area. We're meeting with him on a call in a few minutes.\n(app ringing) Here we go. Nice to meet you. How are you doing? - [Fixer] Fine, let's switch off the A/C. - Did you get the proposal that\nwe sent over of what we're- - [Fixer] Yeah, proposal, I read. - We're not trying to get\nany secretive footage. It's more just about life\nin the Industrial Area. I guess my question for you is, like, if I went into the Industrial\nArea with my camera, not a big crew but just\nmy camera to go film- - [Fixer] What camera? - Like this. If I went into the Industrial\nArea with this camera- - [Fixer] No, no, no. - and filmed\n- [Fixer] No. Another thing, your skin color\nis also a problem, you know? - Ah, explain that. What do you mean? - [Fixer] Yeah, it will make, you know, you will get undue attention. - From who do you think I\nwould get undue attention? - [Fixer] You know, of course,\nthe informers, and you know, these Industrial Area\nAsian towns are controlled by internal security\nforces, Al-Fazaa police. - So, it's not very smart for me to go filming around in that area? - [Fixer] Yeah. - Okay, and I think that's why\nwe want to figure out a way. - [Fixer] Have you ever\nbeen to Doha, I mean- - [Johnny] No.\n- in Qatar? - It's my first time. (fixer clears throat) What do you think? (dramatic music) - Okay. This is not happening,\nthis is not happening. If we can't do the shots,\nthen this story doesn't work, meaning I won't go to Doha. So, it's pretty important\nfor us to know soon if this is feasible or\nif it's not feasible. Iz, can you- - [Fixer] Yeah, yeah, I\nunderstand, I understand. - Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thank you so much for chatting. I can't safely go into\nthis Industrial Area. Like, it's now clear to me, like, every fixer has just been like, \"No.\" This guy just said it point blank. He's like, \"You're a\nwhite dude with a camera. Like, this is not safe.\" - It feels like, if you go,\nyou're just gonna, what, get shots of shiny buildings\nand not actually gain access. - Yeah. - Which I guess could be cool. - No. - I mean, there's an option here where you try to find someone that could go in. - And then, if we could\nget, like, a camera person in Nepal, or Bangladesh, or somewhere where workers have been and gone home, we could totally tell this story. The World Cup is literally\na few weeks away. I got some work to do. The new plan, find someone\non the ground in Qatar who will go into the Industrial Area\n(paper rustling) and tell me why the hell the government is so afraid of me going in with my camera. (paper rustling) (mouse clicking) Okay (sighs). Okay, before we continue, I need to tell you about something, which is that today's video\nis not sponsored by any brand. Sometimes we do really deep dives into complicated and sensitive topics. It's hard to find a sponsor\nwhen we make stories like this. I wanna tell you about a way that you can support what we're doing. If you're not interested in\nhearing this pitch from me, that's totally fine. So, I'm gonna put a little bar down here on the bottom of the screen. For the rest of you that\nare still here, thank you, and I wanna tell you about The Newsroom. The Newsroom is our community on Patreon, which is more and more\nturning into a place that I am very excited about. Journalism is changing,\nand I'm making big bets that the type of journalism\nthat will succeed in the future is the type of journalism that dives deep without the need for a journalistic institution to dictate what direction we need to go. I want the story to guide\nme whatever way it takes me. And I'm allowed to do that because I'm here on\nYouTube with all of you. But doing this form of\njournalism on YouTube is incredibly resource intensive. Behind the scenes, we have\na lot of people making sure that we're factually accurate, that we are actually finding\nthe best facts possible. It's hard and resource intensive, but I'm gonna keep doing it. That's where you all come in. For those who are supporting\nover at The Newsroom, you allow us to do this\nkind of journalism. But if that's not enough for you, we also have some really cool perks, including an extra video every month. We do a behind-the-scenes\nvideo every month, where we show you everything\nthat is happening, all of the people, and\npersonalities, and processes that make this stuff happen. There are a lot of really\nfun, talented people making this work possible. You also get access to one\nof my scripts every month, and you get access to some\nexclusive Tom Fox tracks. Tom is our composer. He makes amazing music. We will give you some of\nthat music, royalty free, for you to use however you'd like. And we'll ask the community to vote on thumbnails, and\ntitles, and video ideas. And I really value having a\nsmaller version of this group here on YouTube but, like,\nover on The Newsroom. If you're not able to\nsupport, that's totally fine. I appreciate you being\nhere in the first place. At the end of the day, being\nhere, watching the videos, sharing them is a huge way\nthat this community allows me to do what I can do to\nmake better journalism. So, that's my little pitch to you for those interested\nand willing to support. I want to get back into this story and show you how we ended\nup in this situation. (resolute music) Qatar is a tiny, super-rich\ncountry in the desert, and it sits on the largest known\nnatural gas field on Earth. (liquid sloshing) Since their independence in 1970, Qatar got really rich, really fast, leapfrogging the normal\neconomic development process that countries go through as they grow. Usually, as a country gets rich, immigrants from poorer\nneighboring countries migrate in to take lower paying jobs\n(machines buzzing) required to keep the economy growing, construction, hospitality, manual labor, care-taking, food services, you know what I mean. Every rich country experiences this, but in Qatar,\n(inquisitive music) all of their neighbors were also getting super rich super fast,\nso they started looking elsewhere for cheap\nlabor, and soon, there was a flow of people taking these jobs. But there's a tension here. Thanks to all this\nabundant oil and gas money, the Qatari government provides\na luxurious welfare state to their citizens, free\nhealthcare, education, guaranteed jobs, subsidized housing, and literally, they just get\npaychecks for being Qatari, for winning the fossil-fuel jackpot. So, Qatar needed labor\nfrom other countries, but they didn't wanna let these immigrants in on the sumptuous benefits\nof their welfare state. So, they started using this system, where employers could sponsor workers to come to Qatar to work. They wouldn't be citizens\nor anything close to it. They would be totally at\nthe mercy of their employer. This was called the kafala system, and it was the foundation upon which Qatar built its country. (inquisitive music continues) - The winner to organize the 2022 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. (energetic music)\n(audience cheering) - So, this is a giant moment. It's oof. I mean, I made a whole video\nabout how this happened. I'm not gonna go into it, but the fact is that, as soon\nas Qatar won the World Cup- - Thank you, FIFA. - they had a lotta work to do because their country didn't\nhave a lot of infrastructure, basically any infrastructure\nat all, to host this thing. So, wait, why were they\nchosen to host the World Cup if they didn't have any infrastructure? It's a long story. Again, I made an entire video about it. The fact is they needed to build a bunch of stuff in a very short time. So, what they basically did\nis just ramp up the system that they already had,\nimporting tons of labor from South Asia and Africa\nto come build their country, in this case, to build\ninfrastructure for the World Cup. (energetic music continues) So, yeah, I've been deep in\nthe context, and the history, and the data for all of this, the stuff I can do from the office, but the fact is time is running out. (active music)\nI need to find someone on the ground, someone in Doha, someone in Bangladesh or\nNepal who can help me capture what is actually\nhappening in these places, talk to the people there. I've been planting lots of seeds, and some of them are starting to sprout, so we're getting closer. We're getting closer.\n(mouse clicking) (inquisitive music) - Hey, I've been talking\nwith a journalist in Nepal who's really great and can\nconnect us with workers who've returned home. He's done a lot of work on this, and he can go out and\nshoot these interviews. (inquisitive music continues) - I'm finally just settling into the fact that I'm not going to Doha,\nand I'm disappointed in that because I wanted to be on the ground. I wanted to see this issue,\nbut the right choice is to use those resources\nto engage camera people to go capture the right stories in different parts of the world, and that's what we're gonna do. Luckily, I've got Instagram.\n(upbeat music) I also have miso soup. (Johnny slurping) Hey, Sandra, thanks so\nmuch for reaching out. I really appreciate it. I'm doing this deep dive on the World Cup. Put a call out for people\nin Doha to help me out here. I was gonna be going to Qatar, and I was gonna be there\nnext week, but I'm not going. I'm now looking for people\non the ground to help me, and as always, a bunch\nof people responded. I live in a world where I\ncan just ask for things, and there's such a supportive community who wants to help with these stories, which is just an amazing reality. Probably 15 to 20 hours\nover the next two weeks getting some shots. Can I officially, you know, hire you as a contractor to do this? And again, all of this is 100% anonymous. We will make sure that everyone is safe. (lips fluttering)\n(inquisitive music continues) Bingo, yes, yes, yes. I am talking to somebody in\nQatar who is a journalist who wants to help me out and is excited. Oh, my god, I feel so much better. There is someone in Doha\nwho has camera skills, there we go, who has language skills, who has journalism skills,\nwho's excited to help and is just ready to go. Oh, my gosh, nice to meet you (laughs). - [Raj] Hello. - How you doing? - [Raj] Yeah, everything's great. - Really appreciate you just, like, harnessing the energy on this\nand just being super down. And they have access\nto the Industrial Area. Yes. I want you to tell me\nhow comfortable you feel about this process in terms\nof safety and security, what's sensitive, what's not. Just gimme an overview of\nwhere some red lines are here. I found someone in Doha who I could give a camera to to film. We're gonna call him Raj. We won't be showing his face. We'll change his voice because he could get in\ndeep trouble for this. - [Raj] First things first,\neverything is monitored, or, like, surveillance works\neverywhere in this country. No matter where I film,\nI'm also being filmed. Specifically, if you come\nto the Industrial Area, there are a few layers to what we can do and what we cannot do. - [Johnny] And over the next several weeks of talking to Raj, I\nrealized that my fixation on this one blue square isn't\nactually the full story. It's just the beginning. - [Raj] I plan to go on every street and film from inside the car, and I think that's the safest way to film and get, like, the vibe of what is it like to get inside the city. (ice cubes clinking) (Johnny exhaling)\n(glass thudding) - We have someone on the ground with a camera that we bought them. I've lined them out on\nhow to shoot undercover. - [Raj] I actually\nwanted to ask you, like, how do you get along shooting footages without getting noticed? - The key to filming without being seen is to look elsewhere. You're holding this thing like you're holding a an ice cream cone. - [Raj] Yeah.\n- You're walking around, and you're looking elsewhere, and then you just smoothly,\nyou know, put it away, and you just get really comfortable with turning it on and off. They're going to the Industrial Area. They are very, very cautious\nfor a very good reason. I would like you to shoot\nin 60 frames a second. I'd like you to shoot in 4K. This is gonna be an amazing\nstory if we can pull it off. 'Kay, goodbye.\n- Talk to you soon. - The government of Qatar is way more insane than I\nexpected, and we're gonna take a lot of precautions\nto keep everyone safe. We're gonna show the world what Qatar doesn't want the world to see. (tense music) - [Raj] So, I'm an Uber because, frankly, it's\nvery unsafe to go on a bus. This is the bus stop where you get on a bus to the Industrial Area. How much time does it\ntake for you to get here? It should be like one\nand a half hour, right? - Raj was finally heading\nto the Industrial Area to show us exactly what this place was. But it wasn't until we\nheard from the people who had worked there and lived there that we began to see how\ndeep this trap really was. Today is the day. In Nepal, a million miles away, they have been shooting interviews. Look, these are people who actually worked on the World Cup stadiums and\nare now back home in Nepal. You start to get to the human side of it, and it becomes way less theoretical. It's way less about these\nzoning maps and stuff, and it becomes about real humans, and this where it starts to get heavy. (dramatic music) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (footsteps plodding) (Bikram speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music continues) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (child speaking in foreign language) - As we've been setting\nup all these logistics and figuring all of this out, (mouse clicking) we've also been reporting\nand investigating the bigger context here. The Industrial Area,\nthis little blue shape on the map is\n(paper rustling) actually just one of several mechanisms that the Qatari government\nuses to bring people over to their country to trap them there and then to exploit them to work to build all the things they want them to build. (paper rustling)\n(pensive music) Lemme show you. Okay, so it's 2010. Qatar just won the World Cup bid. They have to build an unfathomable\namount of infrastructure in a very short time. They do this by paying a bunch of people to go to these countries,\nto small villages in places like Bangladesh and Nepal to recruit a bunch of workers\nto come to Qatar to build. And this is the first phase of what I'm calling the Qatar trap because it is here where\nthese workers were told they had to pay a recruitment fee, usually like one to $4,000\njust to, like, get recruited to go to Qatar and work. These people don't have\none to $4,000 lying around. So, they often would\nborrow money from family or take out a loan with\nreally high interest rates. So, even before they start working, they start their relationship\nwith work in Qatar with debt. So, now you have workers from\nBangladesh, India, Nepal, all over this region flooding\ninto Qatar to start building. As this is happening,\nQatar implements a law. (dramatic music) This is a law that's\nmeant to protect families. Okay. The law says that worker\ngroups are not allowed to live within, quote, \"family\nareas\" in the city of Doha. It's a little ambiguous. Well, the government later clarified that what they're\nreferring to is bachelors, people in Qatar that are single men. Okay, so these bachelors\ncan't live in family zones. Where are these family zones\nthat bachelors can't live in? Is it just like one\nlittle part of the city? (inquisitive music)\nNo. To clarify, they released\na map that looks like this. Everything in yellow is a family zone, a place where bachelor workers\nare not allowed to live. If you project it onto, like, a real map, you will see that this is\nthe entire city, basically. And then, they reserved one\nlittle plot of land a city away, still zoned for Doha,\nthis little blue shape, where these bachelor workers can live. Oh, but they made a few exceptions. Anyone who works at, like,\nmarkets, and barber shops, restaurants, oh, and\nwhite collar professionals who are bachelors can also\nstay in the family zones. So, really these working\nbachelors is just a euphemism for guys who look like this, guys who are there doing construction who Qatar does not want to see\nin their shiny downtown area. So, they reserved them a spot out here in the desert next to the sewage pond. This is the map that sent\nme down the rabbit hole, and now I see it for what it is. I knew something was up. I looked at a bunch of these\n(censored) zoning maps. They're using this to put the people that they don't wanna see in the places that will never be seen. So, now these guys are\nalready laden with debt because of the recruiting fees, and now they're relegated and trapped into this part of the\ncity, the part of the city that I was not allowed to go\nto without getting arrested. This is where Raj is on his way to. This is where we're getting footage from. (tense music) - [Raj] 50 minutes into the ride, and we're kind of starting to see these kind of accommodations\nwhere the workers live. This is one of those\nbuses that the workers that live in the Industrial\nArea use to commute. Today is Friday, and it's a leisure day for a lot of workers, as\nyou can see a lot of clothes that have been washed and\nleft in the sun to be dried. - So, this is the Industrial Area. It's the thing I've been thinking about for a very long time, and I'm finally seeing\nthe footage from inside, and I have to say, it's not\nanything super surprising. This is kind of anti-climatic in the sense that I'm just looking\nat like a kind of dusty, dilapidated part of town\nwith a bunch of buildings that look the same, and\nyet, I now know a lot more about what this place represents. Look at this. The Industrial Area isn't just far away. It's completely cut off. Here's the metro system, brand new, that they were planning to\nbuild for the World Cup. This is a whole system, connects all of the stadiums and the city. You can see that they planned\na couple of these lines to go out to the Industrial Area. This would connect the\nIndustrial Area to the city, and yet, these (laughing)\nlines aren't actually built. They're gonna start on these right after the World Cup is over. So, yeah, this place is just,\nlike, completely disconnected. I think I now see that, and it's not just\ndisconnected unintentionally. This is very systematically,\nintentionally disconnected from the rest of the city. Our interviews in Nepal\ngave us some clarity on what it's like to live out there. (mouse clicking) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - The next phase of the\nQatar trap has to do with how these people were exploited, how their rights were taken away from them to force them to work. (pensive music) To build the World Cup,\nthese workers were forced to work in very horrible conditions. Look at the temperatures\nin Doha in the summer, getting close to 50 degrees Celsius, close to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. They literally have\nair-conditioned outdoor spaces. Look at that, air conditioning\noutside on wheels. The stadiums themselves\nwill have air conditioning. And yet, these workers are out there doing, like, manual labor in this heat. (Bikram speaking in foreign language) - A lot of workers report\nbeing treated like animals, being yelled at and bossed\naround in totally inhumane ways. (Bikram speaking in foreign language) - Behind these walls, the conditions that these people were made to live in and really given no choice on where they could live are horrendous. (Bikram speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - Journalists and human\nrights organizations have actually gotten cameras\nback here to actually show what that looks like. The heat and conditions\ngot so bad for some workers that they never returned home. (Goma speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (camera clicking) (Goma speaking in foreign language) - Thousands of totally\nhealthy young men died while working in these conditions. (inquisitive music) We'll likely never know\nthe true cause of death because instead of a real investigation, the Qatari authorities come out and use these vague classifications\nlike heart failure and natural causes as the cause of death. Doing this robs the family of answers on why their loved one came home in a box. (Goma speaking in foreign language) (gentle music) - So, if these employers are so bad, why don't these employees\njust change jobs? The answer is they can't. (pensive music)\nFor a long time, legally, they couldn't because the next part of this trap has to do with paperwork. (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - Oftentimes this\npaperwork would stipulate that these workers can't change jobs without the permission of their employers. So, the status of these\nworkers who were trapped in their little blue box on\nthe outskirts of the city was completely at the mercy\nof their employers. If they left their job,\nthey would be considered a foreign immigrant illegally there and could be arrested and put into jail. (Sushil speaking in foreign language) - Just one more layer of the trap. And then, there was the fact that these employers would\noften not pay their workers for months at a time\nwithholding wages from them and thus increasing their\nleverage and power over them. And with no recourse, these workers couldn't\ndo anything about it. So, yes, we are now talking about forced labor with no compensation, a euphemism for modern-day slavery. I know that sounds dramatic, but that's literally\nwhat is happening here, not to all workers. There were workers who\nhad great conditions and who got paid on time, but this system enabled firms\nto so deeply exploit workers because it gave them\nso much power over them and so little recourse for these workers to complain or do anything without being punished or arrested. So, with with no other options, some workers turned to their\nlast resort, protesting. (dramatic music) (protestors speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (Sushil speaking in foreign language) (protestors speaking in foreign language) - Here they are blocking\ntraffic, central Doha. (mouse clicking) But don't be fooled here. This wasn't some worker uprising. This type of thing is illegal in Qatar, an authoritarian police state where assembly like this\nis totally not okay. So, what happened is the\npolice would show up, squash these protests, tell them that everything was gonna be okay and they would get paid and then deported a huge number of these people,\ngot them outta the system so that the status quo could remain. - [Raj] Just dehumanizing\npeople that belong to a certain race and are brought here for certain purposes is\nnot justified by any means. - Thanks to international scrutiny, Qatar started to make some reforms. They realized this wasn't gonna fly if they were gonna host the World Cup. So, they started instituting\nthings like worker hours that were not in the heat of the day, mandatory water on site so these\npeople could stay hydrated, a minimum wage, changing the law so that people could\ntechnically change jobs without permission, compensating families for people who died working. All of this looked great on paper, but human rights organizations like Amnesty International\nactually have looked to see if those policies have\ntrickled into reality. And you know what I'm gonna say. They haven't. (pensive music) - [Raj] This is the Shahaniya labor camp. This is big walls. A lot of people live here as well. (pensive music continues) - So, yeah, I really understand now what this little blue box\nis for, what it represents. The authorities in Doha are getting ready for this World Cup, and\nas the event approaches, they are making sure\nthat anyone who belongs in this box stays in that box. (dramatic music)\nOkay, this is insane, the timing of this. This is literally happening right now. - [Raj] The whole thing\nhas just been wiped out by some weird phenomenon. - I just got a message from Raj that they are evicting\nworkers from the city. People who are living\n(paper rustling) in the yellow area illegally because of the law are being evicted. It's a couple weeks before the World Cup, and so the timing is not surprising that they are cracking down. (paper rustling) - [Raj] Locks everywhere, everything looks like it\nhas been done really quick. They are literally catching people and putting them into Shahaniya, which is the Industrial Area. I'm trying to get footages\nof them being evicted because a lot of them are being evicted, like, just with two hours of notice. That's what I'm trying to do now. - This is so clear to me what's happening. They're clearly starting to really enforce this, like, family zoning\nthing to get anyone who they don't want to be seen out of the center of the city. I've never done a story\n(laughs) like this before. This is developing, like, day by day, and all of this reporting that we've done, I'm now seeing it play out in real time as the city prepares for the World Cup, using all of these laws to\ncontinue to hide these people, to get them out of view as all of these international\nvisitors prepare to come. - [Raj] It feels so empty,\nand it's only the small houses that have been evacuated. (inquisitive music) - [Announcer] Strike, against the post. (papers rustling) (mouse clicking) - Okay, well we got to the bottom of it. (papers rustling) We know what know why this\nexists, the way it's drawn, what it means,\n(papers thudding) who it's for, what it's meant to do. (headset thudding) I did not expect that. I know what's happening\nbehind those walls, how those people are trapped,\nhow their families miss them, and how some of them\nmight never come home. (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) (Goma speaking in foreign language) - Now, let's be clear, this happened well before the World\nCup ever came to Qatar. And what I fear is that,\nonce we all move on, once these few weeks of\nplaying football are over, we'll forget about everything we saw, and Qatar will have no incentive to actually do anything about this. And they'll go back to what\nthey've been doing for decades, deceiving these workers,\ntrapping them in their country, exploiting them, and then\nhiding them from view.

(upbeat music) I wanna show you a story that feels unique to our time in history. It's a story of how the organization that controls the sport that humans love most was hijacked by a tiny country that controls the resource\nthat humans need most. - [Reporter] Qatar wealth\nfrom oil and natural gas. - [Harris] Resulting in this. A world cup held in the desert, in a country built off fossil\nfuels and foreign labor with a citizen population\nthe size of Honolulu, Hawaii. (clock ticking) I wanna show you how this happened. How Qatar, this tiny country, beat out the US, Australia,\nJapan, and South Korea by convincing 14 of the\n22 most powerful men in football to vote for them to become the host of the 2022 World Cup. - [FIFA official] The winner to organize the 2022\nFIFA World Cup is Qatar.

It's time to dive back\nin to this very deep, but very important story. Here we go. (ominous music) We've been deep in this. Trying to make a web. Trying to make a visual that\nwill help us understand FIFA and why this World Cup is being\nheld where it's being held. (slow electronic music) I wanna show it to you. And I've been really wrestling\nwith how to boil this down. And I think there's\njust three major things that we need to understand if we want to understand how\nQatar bought the World Cup. Check this out. Okay. There's three major things you have to understand to make sense of this story. They are FIFA. You have to understand the World Cup. And you have to understand Qatar. All right, this is our list. If you understand these\nthree things independently, you can put them together to determine what really happened here and how this tiny desert country ended up with the World Cup. So let's start with FIFA. (slow electronic music) FIFA was started by seven\nEuropean nations in 1904. The original goal here was\nto help organize matches for association football,\nwhich is football. It's the thing we all know. It's the game where\ntwo teams of 11 players try to kick a ball into a goal. Football was no means invented here at this time, at this place. People have been kicking a ball around for like a million years. But it was here in\nEurope in the early 1900s when the modern authority\nfor football was born and born in pretty humble beginnings. But FIFA quickly grew into a transnational\nquasi political authority that spans the whole globe. In fact, we have a map for that. (slow electronic music) So this is FIFA today. It is massive. It represents 211\ncountries or associations that all belong to this one\ngiant sporting organization. The most powerful, easily the most powerful sporting\norganization in the world. And it's got these six major\nregions or confederations. And it was the leaders from\nthese regional confederations who in 2010 sat on FIFA's\nexecutive committee, based here in Zurich, in this\nbunker-like headquarters. I was actually there just\na few weeks ago actually. I'm in Zurich. This is where the FIFA\nheadquarters, the FIFA museum are. This is where the votes happened. (slow electronic music) (crowd clapping) (announcer speaking foreign language) Okay, let's get back to this. Here we go. The 24 most powerful men in football. The ones who would go on to decide who would be the host\nof the 2022 World Cup. Here they are. They're just hanging out on our diagram sorted by their confederations. Sapp Blatter, the president\nright here at the top. Swiss guy. I'm gonna cross it off. I'm gonna cross it off the list. FIFA. We didn't go over all of it. There's obviously way more to FIFA than what I just talked about. The corruption, the scandals, all of it. But for the purposes of this video, we're just trying to answer the question how did Qatar end up with the World Cup? What we need to know is\nwhat we just talked about, the executive committee, the 24 most powerful men in football. I'm gonna cross it off the list. Next on our list, the World Cup. (upbeat music) So eventually FIFA got big enough to where they could put on a\nbig international tournament and people would actually come. They held it in Uruguay in 1930. 13 teams participated and\nthey called it the World Cup. It quickly became the most\nprestigious tournament in football and eventually would become the most viewed sports\nevent on the planet. (announcer screaming) Beating out even the Olympics if you consider that 1.1 billion people, like a decent chunk of the\nentire global population, were simultaneously watching in 2018 when France beat Croatia in\nthe World Cup final in Moscow. 1.1 billion people at the same time all watching the same thing. And I mean that's insane. But it's also kind of amazing. Like what other thing brings\nthat many people together? It is an amazing thing what\nglobal football has become. And that is basically thanks to FIFA. (mystical music) (announcers commentating) - Sport has the power to\ninspire and unite people. - I mean you, I'm immediately like, actually almost crying. Like this is, this is beautiful stuff. Look at this. Look at this guy. Look at this. These moments of like\namazing like performance and then this, the\nreaction of these crowds. But it must be noted that when you have this much\nattention on one event, 13% of the entire global\npopulation watching at one time, it will quickly become less\nabout the beauty of this game and more about, I mean, you\nknow what I'm gonna say, more about money. With so much attention, corporations pay endless money to get their logos\nanywhere near this stuff. Here or here or here. Okay, that's not that surprising. What blows my mind is how\nfar governments will go to also pay endless money to get anywhere near the World Cup. Not because they make money in\nreturn like the corporations. They always end up losing tons of money. But because there's a power in having the entire world\nfocused on your country for a few weeks. - Together, you've given\nthe American people an extraordinary opportunity to welcome the world to our shores as host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. - I mean, look at this. Look at this. We plotted this actually. We found this data. Every four years is a World Cup. And this is how much each of\nthese countries have spent on their World Cup. These are again, taxpayer money here. This is government money being invested into hosting the World Cup. Throw this sucker onto a bar chart and you get something like this. Like it's getting out of hand. Like every year, they spend\nmore and more and more. Oh, and spoiler alert, wait till I show you this\ngraph with Qatar in the mix. Minds will be blown. I can promise you that. (electronic music) The point is that countries are willing to pay more and more to get\nthe World Cup in their country. A moment for them to put\ntheir best foot forward on a global stage. This is what we like to call soft power. Okay. I am crossing the\nworld cup off of our list. Not because I covered every angle of it, but because for the\npurposes of this story, this is what matters. Countries are more and more\nwilling to pay unlimited amounts of money to try to get\nthis event in their country because a billion people\nare gonna watch it. It makes them look good. Okay? We're crossing it off. All right, onto the last\npiece of our puzzle. Qatar, a country that\nshould be pronounced Ga-tar, but I'm not gonna be that pretentious guy who shows up trying to like say it in the local pronunciation cuz it makes me sound cultured and cool. I am that guy. I'm trying to not be that guy. So for now, I'm just going to say it like a Texas\noilman says it, Qatar. Okay? Thanks. (slow electronic music) I'm gonna be really quick\non this history of Qatar. Like we're not going into\nthe full thing, okay? This is a very juicy history that I could easily do\na whole video about. I'm gonna give you the sparknotes, which is that Qatar,\nfor most of its history, was populated by nomadic\ntribes and fishing villages whose biggest industry was pearl diving, which is like, a pretty\ngnarly thing to do. Like you like tie a rock around your ankle and go under to find clams\nand then open the clams and see if there's pearls. It was like hard work. The British eventually swooped in because the industrial\nrevolution was happening and they smelled oil over here. Qatar becomes a British\nprotectorate until 1971 when they became an independent country and Islamic constitutional monarchy, run by one family dynasty. So by the seventies,\nthe British were gone. But crucially, the oil was not. And because of said oil, Qatar quickly transitioned from a poor tribal society to a globally connected energy\nhub with unlimited money. This accelerated in the seventies when Qatar won the fossil fuel lottery and discovered that they just happened to be sitting on the largest\nknown natural gas field on the planet. This guy. They share a bit of it with the territorial waters of Iran, but most of it is theirs. (slow electronic music) Oh, and by the way, all this fossil fuel and\nthe revenue coming from it belongs to this teeny country, which this is a very teeny country. Like we're talking about a country that fits inside of the\nsole of the boot of Italy. Look at this. I mean it doesn't totally fit. It's like, but it's tiny. And we're talking about a few\nhundred thousand Qataris here. This isn't a big population and yet they're all getting in on this unbelievable amount of wealth. Like we can't fathom how rich this teeny little thumb shaped country is. They could not spend\ntheir money fast enough. They didn't have enough\nlabor to build all the stuff that they had money for. So they started to import\nlabor from other countries. 95% of the people who live\nand work here are not Qataris. They're expats from other places. 95%. Meanwhile, the teeny population that are actually Qatari\ncitizens live very good lives. They're some of the richest\npeople on the planet. Most of them work very\ncushy government jobs that pay really well. They live in a welfare state\nwhere their needs are met because there is just unlimited money for everyone in this country. Okay, that's Qatar. (upbeat music) So this is the moment\nwhere the three pieces of our puzzle come together. Because in the nineties, Qatar starts to read the tea leaves. They start to realize that\nthe world is gonna move away from fossil fuels, the\none thing that they have. Their gravy train is gonna come\nto an end in a few decades. It's time to prepare for\nthe future, said Qatar, by investing their billions and billions, hundreds of billions of extra dollars into anything and everything\nthat is not fossil fuels. Diversify. So they start to go nuts. Everything from real estate\nin Singapore and New York City to buy the St. Petersburg\nAirport in Russia to buying Miramax Films and the Italian luxury brand Valentino. Like, boy, should I just\nmake an entire video on Qatar Investment Authority? Cuz that would be juicy. In 2017, the BBC noted\nthat Qatar owns more land in the UK than the Queen does. And as a part of this big diversifying strategic\ninvestment effort, Qatar focused on turning their country into a global hub for\nprestigious international events. You see where I'm going with this? Lucky for them, there is a shortcut to the most prestigious\nevent in the world. The World Cup. (upbeat music) Oh, and this event happens\nto be run by an organization that speaks a language that\nthey're very familiar with. The language of money\nand power and influence. And here's where we are. (slow electronic music) So we're back here to this web. These gatekeepers of\ninternational football, the people who voted on who was gonna host the 2022 World Cup. 14 of these guys voted Qatar. And I want to know why. Qatar, a country that FIFA itself, when they were evaluating all\nthe bidders for the hosting, decided was not super suited for this. There's all these parameters that countries should\nhave to be a good host. Qatar didn't really have a lot of 'em. And in fact, they had the opposite. Super hot weather. No widespread football infrastructure. And perhaps most strikingly, not a huge tradition of football or even a significant local population to spread football to in their place. Like they have a couple\nhundred thousand people. The World Cup is supposed to\nbring football to new regions and spread it throughout a country. How are they gonna do\nthat in a hot desert oasis with like 300,000 people? So let's do this. We're done with our list. Let's move on to the\nnext part of this video, which is probably the part\nwe put the most effort into. And I want you to stick with me here because the point isn't to\ngo into every single detail of how some of this corruption went down. No one's gonna remember\nevery little detail. That's not the point. The point is to give you a\nsampling of the mechanics of how influence and power works. Not just in FIFA, but in the\ninternational system generally. How powerful people get what they want. We'll never know for certain\nbecause this vote was secret. But we know Qatar got 14 of these guys. And I think I have a\npretty good idea of how for most of them. (slow electronic music) We're gonna start with this guy. This is Mohammed Bin Hammam. He's one of the executive\ncommittee members and he's from Qatar. Okay. We can safely assume\nthat he probably voted for his own country. But more importantly, it was him, a big wig, international football guy who helped pull the strings\non everyone else on this web starting with this guy. Jack Warner. He's an executive committee member from Trinidad and Tobago. Leaked emails and bank records obtained by the Sunday Times revealed\nthat before the vote, Bin Hammam deposited $450,000 directly into Warner's account. And later even more,\ntotalling $1.6 million. Just like literally,\nlike he just paid him. Like that's, this is the simplest version. Just like I will pay you money to give to, so you do what I want you to. It's just like so straightforward. No wonder a month after\nthe vote, in an email, Warner called his Qatari\ncolleague Bin Hammam, quote, \"the only brother I have in football.\" Okay. One guy down. Who else? Next, we have the three\nexecutive committee members from the South American Confederation. The US Department of\nJustice has gotten involved with these guys. They recently released\nan unsealed indictment against all three of them, alleging that these three were quote, \"offered and received bribes\nin exchange for their votes.\" I mean, it's pretty unsatisfying. We don't have the evidence\nthat the DOJ is using for this case, but\nthey're building a case. Oh, and by the way, two of these guys just died in like the past couple of years. Next up, we've got these three guys from the African Confederation. A year before the vote, the African Confederation was\nhaving their annual meeting in Angola, which by the way, was paid for by the Qatar bid team. The people who were like\ntrying to convince people to vote for the World Cup. They paid for the whole thing. Okay. I get it. Trying to lobby for your team. That's fine. But here's where it gets shady. While they were at this meeting, the Qatar bid team met with these three executive\ncommittee members. And according to a former employee who was in the room translating, the Qataris offered 1.5\nmillion dollars each to these guys in exchange\nfor their promise that they would vote for Qatar. A year later, this employee turned\nwhistleblower actually went back on her statement, saying that\nshe actually lied about it and that there were no bribes. Kind of fishy. What's your incentive to lie? But then the FBI showed\nup at her front door and she admitted that she was pressured to say that she had lied about it and that actually the bribes happened. I don't know, man. We don't like... I side with the whistleblower. You can decide how you feel. And now her life is basically ruined. She said in an interview that quote, - I will always look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. - Oh, okay. And while\nwe're talking about this, one of those three guys that apparently got 1.5 million dollars was later filmed by undercover reporters negotiating an $800,000 bribe\nin exchange for his vote. Like smoking gun evidence. Same thing happened to this guy, the executive committee member\nfrom the Oceania region. And they actually got\ndisqualified from voting. So these two guys didn't actually vote. So we're now down to 22 exco members. Let's keep going. (slow electronic music) Okay, so we've gone over the instances where there was direct money given in exchange for the promise to vote. The next phase of the story\nare more subtle versions of influence. Less overt. Less smoking gunnish. Like this guy from Thailand. He's the executive committee\nmember from Thailand. Four months before the vote, Thailand and Qatar were\nrenegotiating an energy deal. Thailand was trying to get a better price for their natural gas, something Qatar has a lot of. But for some reason, this guy, a FIFA executive committee\nvoting member was at the meeting. Wait, what? Why is this football guy in the room while there's these big\ngas negotiations going on? Yes, I'm being coy. We know where this is going. I mean, you gotta read\nthese leaked emails. They're so juicy. You've got a FIFA guy\nemailing a Qatar gas guy from Qatar Petroleum. They're talking about the development of their two football associations from their different countries and then saying that they're gonna liaise with the CEO of the gas company to follow up about a\nliquid natural gas sale. I mean, it's just so clear\nwhat's going on here. Favorable terms of the\ndeal in exchange for, \"Hey dude, make sure to\nvote for our country.\" (slow electronic music) Oh, and who was this meeting between the gas guy and\nthe FIFA guy arranged by? You guessed it. This guy, Mohammed Bin Hammmam, the executive committee member from Qatar who's pulling all these strings. Oh, by the way, just a\nlittle side note here. Going through these leaked emails, I couldn't help but notice\nthat the FIFA guy's email was sour_piggy@ redacted. (chuckles) Sour piggy? Sour piggy. Sour piggy's doing a lot of corruption. Okay. (chuckles) - [Cameraman] I'm cutting, dude. - Oh shit. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then there's a few just like, sort of circumstantial ones that give you a flavor of how this works. Like this guy who sold his family's land to Qatar a year after the\nvote for 27 million pounds, which was like way over asking price. And this executive committee member whose son was given a job\nat a private Qatari hospital shortly after the World Cup vote. Both of these guys, of course, like everyone else on this list, denies any connection,\nthat this was influenced. But now we're at the most\nsignificant moment in all of this. The thing that really tipped\nthe scales for the vote. And it has to do with this confederation. The most powerful, the\nEuropean Confederation. Specifically this guy, Michel Platini. A former French football\nplayer turned FIFA guy. He was the president\nof this confederation, which inevitably meant that he has sway over these other dudes. Just one week before the\nvote, like crunch time, Platini got an invitation\nthat he couldn't refuse. A luncheon with the French\npresident at his palace. Platini later said that\nbefore this meeting, he was planning on voting for the US to host the World Cup in 2022. But he goes to this luncheon\nand who else is there? No big deal. Just these two guys, the\nmost powerful dudes in Qatar. One of them, the prime minister of Qatar and the other, the current Emir of Qatar from like the old dynasty family. It's important to\nremember the context here. Like what's happening. This is 2010. The world has just been rattled by a global financial meltdown and the president of France, Sarkozy, is stressed and he's in the room with the leaders of Qatar who are not nearly in the\nsame financial trouble. See the section before\nabout unlimited amounts of money thanks to fossil fuels. And it's clear that these\nQataris want something. Something that the Frenchmen\nin the room can deliver them. A vote for their country\nto host the World Cup. Something they really want. According to sources\nclose to this meeting, Sarkozy flat out told\nPlatini to vote for Qatar. Why? Well, we'll never know. But it's clear that he wanted\na few things from Qatar. In this same meeting, Sarkozy told the Qatari\nthat he wanted Qatar to buy the French football\nteam Paris Saint-Germain, which happens to be Sarkozy's\nfavorite football team. And at the time was in financial ruin. After this meeting, a few\nimportant things happened. Number one, Qatar did end\nup buying that football team for 60 million pounds\njust like Sarkozy wanted. They turned it around and soon\nit became a star studded team with merch that's worn by the world's most popular celebrities. And then we suddenly see an uptick in big trade deals\nbetween Qatar and France. Qatar Airways buys 50\ngiant planes from Airbus, the giant French airplane maker. I mean, if you look at what\none of these planes cost in 2010, times it by 50, we're looking at 18 billion dollars. A massive deal. And in the end, Platini in this room with his president telling him\nto do what the Qatari want. We need them right now. And it worked. Michel Platini flipped his\nvote from the USA to Qatar. He admitted it later. That's not even speculation. The president of the executive\ncommittee, Sapp Blatter, was pissed about this and later said that this\nwas the defining moment for Qatar winning. - They have influenced Michel Platini at that time to vote for Qatar. - Because remember, Platini then went back to his European Confederation with eight executive committee\nmembers, eight votes, and he almost certainly\ninfluenced others to join him. One book I read claims that\nhe took four votes with him. But we'll never know. And then on a cold day\nin December of 2010, the day of the vote came. (dramatic music) - [Announcer] The 2022 FIFA World Cup. - [Harris] So on that faithful\nday in the winter of 2010 in Zurich, all the guests arrive\nbecause it was voting day. - Every- - Clearly, I think we had\nabsolutely fantastic bid. - Well, we got a great bid,\nso we just gotta go in there and give it everything that we've got. - These 22 men cast their\nvotes in multiple rounds until a majority victor emerged. At least 11 of them voted\nfrom Qatar since round one. And finally, 14 votes\nwere delivered to Qatar, a majority and almost\ndouble what the USA got. (dramatic music) So yeah, that's how it went down. That's how it went down. Like, look, we'll never\nknow exactly what happened. A lot of this stuff we\nknow because it leaked out and we were able to put it all together. But the fact is every one of\nthese men has been involved in some corruption investigation. I mean, it's no surprise\nthat this stuff happened and probably so much more. FIFA is corrupt to the core. Qatar didn't make this happen. Qatar just saw an organization\nthat spoke their language, the language of unlimited money, and they used that to\nget what they wanted. To prepare for the future, to diversify, to get the world to look at them. - [Announcer] It is the\nbiggest event in the world. - So no, this isn't just a game. The reason why all of this matters is because football can be a beautiful thing. No matter what language someone speaks or their politics or\ntheir God or whatever, they have this universal\nlanguage, this game. A global culture full of\nscreaming and cheering and crying and pride and identity. It's ridiculous, yet so\nbeautiful, so uniquely human. And in a very real way, football\nis a mirror to the world. What's acceptable here in\nthis most revered sport is what's acceptable everywhere. So by using money and\ninfluence to get the bid for the World Cup, Qatar showed us just how\npower works in our world. They showed us who really\nmatters and who doesn't and validated an old idea that the rules of fair\nplay don't really matter if you have enough money. (slow melancholy music) Hey, thanks for watching and for sticking around\ntill the end of the video. This is just the first\nof two videos we made on this topic. The next video publishes soon and it's kind of the next\nchapter of the story. What happens after Qatar\ngets hold of the World Cup and they have to build\nall this infrastructure. And it's a very long, intense journey that I go on to report that story and I kind of tell the story\nof that reporting experience. So that will be out soon. I wanna tell you about a couple ways that you can support our journalism here. We do these deep dives. They take a lot of effort\nand we need support not just from sponsors, but more and more from the community. We have a community called \"The Newsroom\", which is over on Patreon, and it is a place where you can get an\nextra video every month. It is a behind the\nscenes vlog of everything that happens in this\nstudio behind the scenes. The fun, the wild, the\ndeep dives, the animation, the editing, the team, the whole universe that exists behind the camera. I'm just one cog of a very big machine that we're building here. You also get access to my scripts, to interviews that I do with experts that are just like the\nfull length interview. Have influence on thumbnails and titles and even story ideas. So go check out \"The\nNewsroom\" over on Patreon. The link is in my description. If you're a video person\nor a photo person, we also have lots of presets that we use to color\nour videos and photos. We developed these over\nthe course of a year with a professional colorist. They're very wonderful\nand purchasing those, you can use them and they also\nhelp support us over here. So those are a couple\nways that you can support if you'd like to. Thank you for watching this video and subscribe if you haven't already. I will see you very soon in\nthe continuation of this story. See you."

This is a part of the ocean\ncalled the \"Bermuda Triangle,\" or the \"Devil's Triangle.\" It's an aquatic graveyard\nwhere over the years researchers have uncovered\nhundreds of wrecks. Scientific hypotheses have been crafted to try to explain what is happening here. The idea, the fear, has spread sparking countless books and documentaries attempting to prove that\nthere's something strange happening in this triangle of ocean. - [Speaker] There's some kind of a anomaly going on down there that we can't explain. Something that goes on down\nfar, far below the deepest rays, the last rays of sunlight. - [Johnny] In this video, we're gonna explain what the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle really is, and why this perilous patch of ocean has captured the curiosity and\nfear of millions of people.

It's generally regarded\nas this area of water in the North Atlantic, drawn from Miami, to San Juan, to Bermuda. The mystery here kind\nof started back in 1492 when Christopher Columbus\nwho, incidentally, is getting a lot of air\ntime on the channel lately, for better or worse. This is where the\nbiggest light bulb moment of the century goes\noff in this guy's head. I know, I know. The sources are in the\ndescription, I'm sorry. Can we move on, please? Thank you. Anyway, Columbus is out\nthere trying to reach Asia and he passes through\nthis triangle of water, and this is where things get weird. Columbus kept a very detailed journal, which I have a first edition\nEnglish translation of that I'm not freaking out\nabout because I love old books. Did I need to buy this for this story? No. Did I spend way too much\nmoney on it as an excuse? Yes. But while I have it, let's look at it. God, look at this freaking book, gorgeous. Okay, anyway, on September 13th, 1492, Columbus says that as he's\ngoing along this route something weird starts\nhappening with his compass. On this day, \"at the\ncommencement of the night, the needles turned a\nhalf point north-west, and in the morning they turned\nsomewhat more north-west.\" Whoa. Creepy, Chris. But it doesn't stop there. He also reported the sea rising and a strange light out in the distance. He described it like a wax\ncandle moving up and down. What is going on here? The mystery continued\nthroughout the centuries. In 1606, while traveling\nthrough the triangle, a large English ship\ncarrying 150 travelers became wrecked at Bermuda after encountering a huge hurricane. Even though this wasn't mysterious, because it was just weather, it left an impression on how\npeople saw this body of water. In fact, it is supposed\nthat this ship wreck inspired Shakespeare's\nplay, \"The Tempest,\" which often referred to\nBermuda, or Bermoothes, as being vexed or cursed. Okay, but listen to this one. Next up is 1881. This ship is sailing from\nLiverpool to New York City. When it passes through the triangle, the people on board say that they came across a ghost ship\nwith no one on board. There are varying reports\non exactly what happened, but the people on board generally reported that some of the crew decided\nto get on the ghost ship, but then the ships were\nseparated by a massive storm. When they were reunited with\nthe ghost ship the next day, there was no trace of the crew. This stuff is kind of spooky if true. But wait, we're just\ngetting started because when you get to the 20th Century, that's when the Bermuda Triangle, as a mysterious body of water, started to gain a lot of attention. In February, 1918, one of\nthe US Navy's largest ships, the USS Cyclops, was carrying 300 men from Salvador, Brazil\nto Baltimore, Maryland. The route goes right through\nthe Bermuda Triangle, but the ship never arrived to Baltimore. Despite being able to, The Cyclops never sent out an SOS distress call. No wreck was ever found. As one article published a few years after the disappearance said, \"Usually, a wooden bucket\nor a cork life preserver identified as belonging to a lost ship is picked up after a wreck, but not so with the Cyclops.\" \"She just disappeared as though some gigantic monster of the sea had grabbed her, men and all, and sent her into the\ndepths of the ocean.\" In an official statement,\nthe US Navy said that, quote, \"The disappearance of the ship has been one of the most baffling mysteries in the annals of the Navy.\" That's an official quote. Again, kind of spooky. Oh, and the Navy boats kept disappearing. In 1941, the USS Proteus, carrying 58 passengers\nand a bunch of metal, suddenly vanished within\nthe Bermuda Triangle. And then one month later,\nanother Navy ship disappears. 61 people on board totally gone. But it wasn't until 1945 when people started to\nget really suspicious. This is when a bunch of\nWorld War II airplanes were doing a three hour exercise\nover Grand Bahama Island, flying out and then pivoting\nback to their airbase, back in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But these planes never returned and the disappearances\njust kept happening. A long haul flight with\n25 people and six crew disappeared in the triangle\nwithout a trace in 1948. And a year later, it happened again to another plane of the exact same model. All in all, there have been over 70 mysterious disappearances here in this little patch of ocean, where all those years\nago, Columbus noticed something strange\nhappening with his compass. With time, more and more\npeople started noticing. One writer in the '50s said, quote, \"There have been other disappearances in this backyard sea of ours; and always the record, when the account is finally closed, has an ominous notation:\n'No trace found.'\" And then in 1964, the\nterm \"Bermuda Triangle\" was actually coined in an article. Vincent Gadace asserted that, quote, \"Sea distances are relatively short.\" Referring to the Bermuda Triangle. \"And yet this relatively limited area is the scene of disappearances that total far beyond the laws of chance.\" People wanted answers. 10 years later, this book came out. The author goes deep and\nhe makes the argument that something is really\nhappening in the Bermuda Triangle. It's not just bad weather. This mysterious patch of water is actually a gateway to\nsomething much bigger. And then he is not afraid to explore some alternative theories\nabout ancient civilizations and energy that was left\nover from those civilizations affecting this area. It's magnets, it's\ncrystals, it's worm holes, it's the ripping of space time. These forces connect us to the physical potential of our universe. All shown to us because of the mysterious disappearances\nof the Bermuda Triangle. No, no, no! Come on, guys. I hope no one was actually following me down that\nrabbit hole because, you can't read a book like this, talk about a bunch of mysterious things, and call that evidence. That is not what this is. I was really into this for a moment. Actually, when I was going\nthrough all of the disappearances until it started to become\nabout freaking crystals and alien life coming to save\nhumans from nuclear fission. We can't do this. We can't present a handful of data points, even if they're factually accurate, separated by hundreds of\nyears and call that proof that this patch of ocean is cursed. What blows my mind is that this book, the one that really put the\nBermuda Triangle on the map, sold over 14 million copies worldwide. It was translated into 22 languages, despite being riddled with\ncompletely invalidating errors. I mean, what? Come on. I'm actually not surprised. I mean, look at us. Look at what we're doing here. We're sitting here eating this\nstuff up like it's ice cream. People love this stuff. Mysterious stories and finding connections in observations that we\ncan see and understand. I know that at least for me, no matter how data minded\nand objective I am, I kind of get intoxicated\nby a good mysterious story. Our brains are like built for this stuff. Especially when the storyteller throws in little embellishments like- Despite being able to,\nThe Cyclops never sent out an SOS distress call. This tendency is really concerning to me. And honestly, more and more as I realize how powerful of a tool storytelling is. Especially visual storytelling, where I can layer in the\nmusic and the visuals to make your brain think that it is real. Okay, wait a minute, you're asking, \"Is this a video about\nthe Bermuda Triangle?\" \"Or is this Johnny Harris's\ncurrent soul searching about factual accuracy and\nstorytelling on the internet?\" It's both. But let's keep going on\nthis Bermuda Triangle story because there actually\nis a very satisfying evidence based answer to what is really going on\nwith all these disappearances. Here we go. (tense music) There have been some serious\nscientific hypotheses developed on what's going on here. They range from things like, the Bermuda Triangle having a\ndisturbance in geomagnetism, which throws off compasses\nand other navigational tools. Remember, Columbus, creepy Chris? Or methane blowouts,\nwhich is a real thing. We have these huge\ndeposits of like methane under the ocean floor,\nand if these blow up, you get this massive explosion, and then a huge crater\nthat just sucks down anything that is floating on top of it. That could easily explain it, right? Okay, but then there's\nthe plane disappearances. Here's another more simple\nexplanation, hurricanes. The Bermuda Triangle is in the Caribbean, which does seem to have an abnormal number of high intensity storms. That kind of makes sense. And one popular theory\nis that these storms can cause what are called rogue waves, which are massive waves that\nreach a hundred feet or more. Maybe it's those that lead\nto the disappearances. See, this is making more sense. You've got methane gas, geomagnetism, tons of storms in the Caribbean. It makes sense that\nthis is a perilous place for planes and boats. These are scientific explanations that validate the Bermuda Triangle. We don't need Atlantis,\nand crystals, and aliens. We have geomagnetism and weather systems. Rational explanations\nfor the Bermuda Triangle. No, no, no, no! Shine the light, folks Do not fall for this, again. No, another trap. Me saying sciency things like \"geomagnetism\" and \"methane blowouts\" can sound like I'm presenting\nstrong evidence to you, but I'm not. I'm saying words. I'm speculating. Okay, so will we ever get\nto the bottom of this? Well, yes we can. But not by listening\nto me tell you stories about ghost ships and\nmysterious Navy disappearances, or even 100 foot waves. Instead, we need to\napproach this differently. Humans have developed an\namazing tool for seeing reality. Instead of relying on\nour own observations, which usually need to\nbe couched as stories, and that are limited by how much we can hold in our brain at once. Instead of this, we can\ncollect hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of\nobservations about the world, and they don't have to fit\nin our brains all at once because we can record them over time, and then process and aggregate\nthem with math or maps. And if you did that, you would see that, of the tens of thousands of recorded accidents or casualties at sea recorded over the course of 20 years, there wasn't anything\nout of the ordinary here. It doesn't even make the top 10 most dangerous ocean regions in the world, at least according to another\nanalysis, another data set. We wanted to make sure on this, so we reached out to Lloyd's List, which is a shipping publication who graciously spent\nmonths aggregating data, tons of data about marine\ncasualties out to sea. We found that 1.8% of all\nvessels everywhere in the world have some casualty, including\nmysterious disappearances. 1.8%. And that of the 8,634 boats that passed through\nthe Bermuda Triangle, there were only two casualties. 0.02% of the boats that passed\nthrough here had an accident. 90 times lower than the global average. That was for 2021. So yeah, that's the evidence we should actually be\nlooking at and talking about. It's not as tantalizing as\nthe stories told in this book that sold 20 million copies. But it's true. It's what actually happened. And the beautiful thing is, you can then go and look at my sources, look at the data sets that I used, and you can interrogate them. And you can come back and\ntell me that my data is weak because of the way it was\ncollected and what was left out. That's called \"discourse.\" And it is the foundation of how we know what we\nknow about the world. All of us need to be vigilant of this, perhaps me more than\nanyone, I'm a storyteller. But I also want to be a communicator of true information about the\nworld, to communicate to you. And yeah, we'll definitely disagree on what that information means, and how important certain things are. Interpretation, opinion, et cetera. But I'm here to make a further commitment to going the extra mile to gather the best truth I can to make sure that it's actually real. So, thank you for being here. For being a part of my\ndiscourse, my learning, and to check me on this when I get loose. And to make sure that together we don't let the power of story get in the way of the power of truth.

    "captions": "(dramatic music) - It's easy to think that\nEurope was so successful in taking over the world because they had, like, better\nships or guns, or whatever. But when you actually\nlook at the whole story, you see that it was actually\njust a perfect storm of technology and timing\nand ideology and religion, of a few key inventions. And what I wanna show you in this video is that one of the biggest reasons that Europe was able\nto take over the world is because of the invention\nof the modern corporation, a collection of people\nwho don't know each other but who pool their money\ntogether for the same goal: extracting resources from far away places. So this is part two of \"How\nEurope Stole the World.\" (dramatic music) (image clicking) Hey, before we dive into this story fully, I need to tell you about\nthe sponsor of today's video who made this video possible,\nwhich is Policygenius. Policygenius helps you get life insurance, kind of a topic that none\nof us wanna talk about, but it's a topic we should talk about because life\ninsurance is very important. True story, I was doing a\nPolicygenius sponsorship last year and in the middle of the\nsponsorship realized, \"Wait, I need life insurance.\" And I literally went to my own link and signed up for life\ninsurance for me and my wife. It's a true story. Getting life insurance\nused to be kind of hard, but Policygenius has\nmodernized this process by making it easy to browse\nlots of different plans from lots of different\ninsurance companies. They have no incentive to\nrecommend one more than the other. They literally just take your information, make it super easy for\nyou to see the plans available to you. Like seriously, this was\na really easy process. I didn't have to go into\nsome doctor's office. I didn't have to do anything. I literally filled out a bunch of stuff, talked to someone on the phone, and before you know it I'm\nseeing the different plans and I'm being explained how they work. The thing that convinced\nme the most, I think, was that life insurance is\nway cheaper when you're young, and so now is kind of the time to do it, to like lock yourself into a\ngood policy at a good price. With Policygenius, you can\nfind life insurance policies that start at $17 a month, and that's for like a half a\nmillion dollars of coverage. There's no weird fees, and they're not like gonna\ngo sell your information. I mean, there's a reason why\nthey literally have thousands of five-star reviews on\nTrustpilot and Google. No one wants to talk about\nneeding to use life insurance, but your loved ones deserve\na financial safety net, and you deserve a smarter\nway to find and buy it. To start comparing quotes and\nsimplify insurance buying, go to policygenius.com/johnnyharris. Link is also in the description. Thank you, Policygenius,\nfor supporting this video. Let's dive back into how\nEurope stole the world. (upbeat music) Okay, quick catch-up on\nwhere we are in the story. In part one, we talked\nabout how Spain and Portugal went out to get in on trade and accidentally ran into a bunch of land they decided was unclaimed,\nand it turned into a big race to see who could take over\nas much land as possible. After about a century of this, other Europeans start to take notice of this model of expansion, and they realize that it's a a great way to enrich your country. Some of these countries have\nbeen dabbling in imperialism, but in the early 1600s it\nwas time to get serious. The first to follow suit were the Dutch who were becoming really\ngood at navigating water and making maps and doing business. They decided to follow Portugal's lead and go around the bottom of Africa, stopping right here at the very tip in what today is known as\nCape Town, South Africa. They established a permanent\ncolony of white settlers whose descendants would go on to become a major part of\nSouth Africa's history. (images whooshing) (cheerful music) The Dutch used their prime\nposition in Cape Town to restock on their way to Southeast Asia where they were trading for\nspices with local empires and claiming serious amounts of land in what is today in Indonesia. Around the same time, at\nthe start of the 1600s, we see the next kingdoms trying their hand at large scale imperialism. Meet the two rookies on the block, (upbeat music) England and France, who would go on to actually cause a lot of\ntrouble on the world map, but for now they're just getting started. They, for the most part,\nfollowed Spain's lead going west for the Americas, though England sent ships\neast at this time as well. Anyway, here in the\nAmericas they showed up and, like colonizers before\nthem, found lots of land and lots of people living on that land. Hm, kind of inconvenient. \"These aren't real people, right? \"They don't actually own this land,\" you can hear the English people like sort of saying to themselves. So they came up with a\nnew very useful tool. It was a mental tool. In addition to guns and smallpox and alliances with local tribes that helped them divide\nand conquer the locals, Europeans also developed a\ncomplex set of legal philosophies to convince themselves that these people were not in fact capable to claim any land. After all, they were foragers. They didn't farm. They couldn't own this land because they didn't use\nit for productive means. They were subhuman, or\nat least non-civilized, so they do not deserve to own property. Very clever, very effective. (upbeat music) And so now you see the next\nlayer of ideological thinking that was required for these Europeans to justify their land theft. It was the need to dehumanize the people living on these lands. (upbeat music) Here's a letter from a British settler who describes North America\nas a wilderness, quote, \"Where none inhabit but hellish\nfiends and brutish men.\" This dehumanizing paired really\nwell with another ideology that was very popular at\nthe time, Christianity, (angelic music) a religion that told\nits followers to go out and preach to everyone so\nthat they can be saved. Perfect. (birds cawing)\n(upbeat music) We have these unrefined,\nbrutish, fiendish men, and we have Christians who\nhave the power to save them. Anything is possible now. So by the late 1600s, the colonizing project is fully underway. A lot of Europeans are getting in on this, but here are the major players. You've got Spain and Portugal, the OGs, and then you've got the\nNetherlands, France, and England. We need to make one thing clear that the major reason why\nthese European empires were so successful so quickly was because they were really the first to start trading by sea\nin the Western Hemisphere. So while Jesus and saving and whatever was a big part of the justification of Europeans going out and\nfeeling entitled to take land, he became less and less\nof a part of the picture, especially for the Dutch who\nbasically were just like, \"Who cares about Jesus? We want profit.\" (cheerful music) And this is the next phase of the story of how Europe took over the world. We'll call this chapter Private Empire, and frankly, it's one of\nthe most important things to know about this history. (cheerful music) Remember that European imperialism started as a desire for trade, to trade with big empires in the east. Then surprise, we found all this land. We'll call it unclaimed\nand we'll start claiming it while dehumanizing the\nnatives in the process. Remember? Okay. A lot of that was funded by governments, like kings and stuff, but eventually the citizens\nthemselves of these places realized that they could\nmake a business out of this. And again, this is where the\nDutch wrote the blueprint. (cheerful music) So now instead of asking\nthe ruler for support, they could just get\ntogether a bunch of people and form a corporation, like\nthe first corporation ever, the Dutch East India Company, which would fund private voyages. And you, a random Dutch\nperson in the 1600s, could buy this share, a little\nportion of that company, to get in on a little bit of the profits. But if the profits are big\nenough, then everyone wins. Welcome to the era of corporations. (energetic music) So now you have the Dutch with their new Kickstarter campaign crowdfunding their private empire, totally exceeding their goal. And these Dutch corporate sailors set out on the tried and true routes\nthat they already knew, arriving to Indonesia where they showed up not to convert people\nto Jesus necessarily, but to harvest cloves and peppers\nas efficiently as possible and to come home and to\nsell them for a profit and fatten the pockets of the shareholders who funded the whole journey. This isn't like a surprising\nnovel model to us today because this is how the world runs, but at this point, this\nwas a new invention. Oh, and the government\nsecretly loved this. They could give the company\nsome military power, kind of ignore the details of exactly how it was all going down, and still ensure that their country got in on the world's riches. And these corporations\nleveled up really quickly and became basically\nlittle private empires with the ability to take\nover land, build bases, and establish relationships with locals, not for the prestige of like a king, but so that they could make more money for their shareholders. It was the private investors who helped them get really big really fast all through this invention of\nthe publicly traded company. (melancholy music) And again, it all started with\nthe Dutch East India Company. And just like any startup, they were more nimble than\nthe clunky old government. They had good funding. They were private. They were fast. They had an ability to\nundercut competition. All of this allowed them\nto dominate this region when it came to taking over\nland, harvesting stuff, and bringing it back to Europe. And because they were the best operators, they eventually became the kingpins of all spice trade in Europe, things like black pepper, nutmeg, cloves, all of this because of the countless trips that they were taking between\nthe East Indies and Amsterdam. (melancholy music)\n(thunder cracking) Okay, but it wasn't just the Dutch, the British also got in on\nthis private empire idea. (dramatic music) Let's see here. This map, it's the map of all of the British private companies and there's spheres of influence. The government doesn't own these places. This is like government-supported but by and large private companies, profit-seeking businessmen\nlooking for stuff that they couldn't get\nin their own country going out and finding\nplaces where they could. Over here in North America\nyou have the Virginia Company who's like going hardcore on tobacco, and then its sister company,\nthe Plymouth Company. One was funded by a bunch of Londoners and the other, the\nPlymouth Company, funded by a bunch of rich dudes\nin Plymouth, England. Their job was to colonize land and to build a business in the new world. And then if you look\nover here in the east, you see the British East India Company who got really good at taking over giant\namounts of land in India. (dramatic music) The French were doing the same thing. They had their own West India Company that was colonizing the Caribbean to grow and sell sugar,\nand many, many more. (dramatic music) Private empire was such a\npowerful accelerant to imperialism because it got all of\nthese private empires to compete with each other and to get better and more efficient and to practice their conquests. Repetition fueled by\nprofit-seeking people. They developed amazing\nskills and they drew maps, a lot of beautiful, beautiful maps. (dramatic music) As a map nerd, this is where\nI start to, like, perk up. I notice around this time, like sort of late 1600s\nand then the 1700s, European maps start to\nfill out with more detail, with more accuracy. Because after all, the more\nyou can depict on paper, the better blueprint\nyou have to conquer land and exploit it. So by the 1700s, Europe\nis now a different world than what you saw in the 1400s. You start to see kings\nliving in insane excess. Tea and coffee and chocolate\nand tobacco and sugar, they have access to so much stuff. (dramatic music) And perhaps most significantly, it wasn't just for the ultra rich, it was a new middle class, the mercantile class of\nmerchants who were getting rich off of all of this new commerce. There was suddenly abundance. (dramatic music) And with abundance comes time, time to sit around and\nthink about art and science, all while sipping on coffee\nharvested from faraway lands stimulating these European brains to invent new ways of measuring things, to observe the world, the stars, to manipulate nature, to make life better. And the competition between\nthese private empires just grew. And like with any\nprofit-seeking competition, these companies needed to keep leveling up how much wealth they could\nextract from these places, how much land they could take\nover to meet demand back home, until eventually they turned full on to the most horrific version\nof profit-seeking imperialism: (dramatic music) stealing millions of people from most notably here in West Africa, taking them to their new colonies\nand forcing them to work. (solemn music) (images screeching) Stealing and trading humans\nand forcing them to work was not anything new to this continent. Islamic and African slave\ntraders had been doing this for a very long time, but it was here in the 1700s, in this context of private empire, that things really start to pick up as these European empires, mostly England, Portugal, and\nFrance, took it to a new level to fuel their highly optimized, shareholder-fueled private empires. So optimized that the slave\ntrade itself was outsourced to a private company, at\nleast in the case of England. It was imperial profit-seeking\nefficiency at its finest and most horrifying. You can almost hear the glee and greed in the voice of one English\nslave trader who wrote, quote, \"What a glorious and\nadvantageous trade this is. \"It is the hinge on which all the trade \"of this globe moves.\" (solemn music) But Europeans are starting\nto become really enlightened at this point, right? Like, they're starting to\nthink through like human rights and like equality and starting to lay the\ngroundwork for like democracy. Yes, but remember that\nthese Europeans had ideas in their minds that were planted\nhundreds of years earlier, ideas that allowed them to\ninvent things like the new world and unclaimed land that\nactually belonged to them. They applied a lot of those\nsame ideas to the slave trade. A lack of Jesus, a lack of white European\nculture and technology, making these people\ninferior, in need of saviors, to make use of their land, their resources, and their bodies. (dramatic music) Okay, but let's just be clear\nabout what's happening here. Yes, this is about profit. Yes, this is about ideology. But this part is so damn important to me because this is the foundation upon which our modern world is built. In this moment, these empires\nwere actually building structures in our minds, structures that define who has power, who is worth something,\nwho gets resources, who is permitted to lead,\nto exploit, to benefit. These structures were defined\nby force, by profit, by greed, and they totally worked. They put Europeans on top, giving them the prosperity and resources to fuel scientific, cultural,\nand political revolutions that allowed them to keep\nholding onto that power, to keep exerting domination over others. Okay, yeah, I get it. Half of you just had like a conniption because of this like woke\nsermon that you just got for me. That's not what this is, okay? I'm trying to look at the\nhistory and tie it to today, how all of us live in a world that was built off of what\nhappened during this time, the ideas, the movement of people that happened because\nof this private empire. That's not the woke mob. That's just like what happened. Sorry. (cheerful music) Even after the British\npeople here on the east coast of North America wanted\nto break away from England and start their own country where, quote, \"All men are created equal,\" they still couldn't throw\noff the thirst for profits that slavery brought them. These structures were way too\nfirm, so they kept doing it. The momentum of private empire\nwas too great to slow down, at least not without a bloody war that almost ripped this\nyoung nation apart. (cheerful music) (cannons banging) (swords clinking) So that's private empire, a huge part of Europe's ability\nto take over land on the map and reshape the world. In part three of this series, which is gonna be the final part, I'm gonna tell you what happens next when these powers reach\nevery part of the globe, establishing an order that they control, how we talk, how we do our\npolitics, how we trade, including some really\ngood, positive things that have made the world better. It's an order that was shaped by these forces of European imperialism, and it's an order that still\nshapes all of us today. (cheerful music)"

But I mean, come on they\u2019re BTS. Famous people are always able to like pull\nstrings and like get out of stuff like this. Right? Not in this case. The head of the military manpower department\nsaid that it would be, quote, \u201cdesirable\u201d for them to serve in the name of fairness. They\u2019re trying to, like, lay a precedent\nlike, hey, everyone needs to serve, including the rich and famous. No one is exempt, which I guess that's fair. Literally. And yeah, we all hate the rich people who\nget out of doing what we all have to do. But in this case, it's different. When polled, South Koreans say that they're\nactually in favor of giving BTS an exemption. They're like a national treasure. They\u2019ve brought so much prestige and attention\nand revenue and tourism to this country. But on the other hand, you've got to kind\nof set a precedent here. South Korea's military has been running low\non service members, mainly because of dropping birth rates. And by dropping birth rates, I mean the lowest\nfertility rate on Earth. In 2020, more people died than were born,\nso their population actually went down. Korea\u2019s government is trying to lower the\nphysical and mental standards for people to enlist, but perhaps this is a good idea. Let BTS serve in the military and re-energize\npeople's view of military service. This would certainly have an effect on the\nmany men who avoid conscription through some questionable methods like dumping their citizenship. So actually, I don't have my mind made up\non this. This is a debate about fairness, about military\nservice, about the economy of South Korea. What do you think? Should BTS have to serve in the military? Is it worth it? Let me know."

    "captions": "(speaking in foreign language) - Vladimir Putin has a trick up his sleeve and he's finally using it. It's a weapon he's been\nholding onto for years waiting for this moment. The weapon is this umbilical\ncord that ties Russia to Europe, infrastructure and fuel, now a weapon of war. It starts up here in this\nfreezing cold part of Russia where under the snow and ice\nthere's energy from plants and animals that lived a\nhundred million years ago now stored in the cracks of rocks thousands of meters underground. From here it is sucked up and\nsent through pipes that are in land and water all the way to Europe where it is burned in\npower plants to boil water to turn turbines and make electricity to keep the lights on in Europe. The gas is also burned\nright in European homes to cook a meal or to heat a home. Oh, and it's not just one big pipeline. Natural gas moves through a\nmindbogglingly massive network of pipes linking Russia to Europe. What I want to do here is quickly get you up to speed on what is happening and how these pipelines have been turned into a weapon in a weird\nversion of hybrid warfare. We call it hybrid because you\nhave two things going on here. You've got this traditional old school style war playing out, you've got artillery and\nfoot soldiers and cruelty against civilians, you have the conquest\nan annexation of land. That's like old school style war. And yet Putin hasn't\ndeclared an official war. He's covering this\nwhole thing up back home calling it a special military operation, while simultaneously stealing\na bunch of land in Ukraine and drafting hundreds\nof thousands of Russians to the battlefield. As someone who studies\nconflict, this has gripped me because it's playing out not\njust on these battlefields but on a bunch of other battlefields too. Energy markets, infrastructure,\nfinancial systems and information sharing on\nthe internet that simply has never existed before like this. And it's on these battlefields. where the big nuclear powers\nof our world are going head to head in an\nincreasingly dangerous way. So I'm gonna walk you through the moves and the counter moves of this hybrid war so that we can understand\nhow Vladimir Putin has turned these pipelines\ninto a weapon of war - On Europe's ongoing energy crisis leaders in the region gathering - This week the Russian energy company gas pump drastically\nreduced its deliveries. - Prices skyrocketed ahead\nof the looming winter season. - Before we continue, I want\nto thank today's sponsor NordVPN, who makes a\nproduct I deeply appreciate and use all of the time. The VPN allows you to access content from different countries. Like I can watch like Netflix\nas if I were a British person in the UK cuz I connected\nthe internet via the UK. But that's just one of many features. When I'm traveling, I like\nto connect to the internet via the United States so\nthat my email doesn't kick me out thinking that I'm like a\nhacker in a different country. This makes my life so much easier. The best part is it's super easy. You click one button\nand you are connected. You can even just auto connect. So it just does it in the background. Lately Nord has become even more useful to me because it is now\na threat protection tool. It blocks intrusive ads and web trackers. It inspects your files that\nyou download for malware. It scans URLs and blocks\nanything malicious all in the background so that you can surf the internet\nand feel safe and secure. These features protect your devices but also you and your\npersonal information. And if you want to try it out there's a link in my description. Clicking this link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gets you four\nmonths of free NordVPN on the two year plan. Best part is you can try\nit out for free for 30 days and get all your money back\nif it's not useful to you. Let's get back to the moves and counter moves of the war in Ukraine. First thing to note here,\nthis is not just a war between Russia and Ukraine,\nit's also a war between Russia and a huge group of countries\nthat we're calling the west. Russia started it, but\nnow both sides are engaged in a complex game of 4D chess\nor maybe more accurately we could call it a high\nstakes game of chicken. So let's look at the\nmoves and counter moves on either side and try to make sense of why I'm calling these\nboring pipelines a weapon. As we know this really started in February on a physical battlefield\nwith a full scale invasion. The superpowers in the west\ncouldn't intervene directly with like troops and stuff\nbecause that would risk an escalation between nuclear countries. But they also couldn't\nlet Russia just do this. So the west counter move\nto Russia's invasion was to cut Russia off from a huge number of its\neconomic ties to the world. - The European Union and\nits partners are working to cripple Putin's ability\nto finance his war machine. - The second thing the west did as retaliation for the\ninvasion looks like this. - My administration authorized\nanother $200 million to keep a steady flow of weapons and ammunition\nmoving to Ukraine. - The west has been pouring a huge amount of money and weapons and\nintelligence support and ammunition into Ukraine to help them fight this war. I mean, look at this, this, this this. Yes, I print Wikipedia articles sometimes like why did I print it? Because I like to look\nat it in physical form. It makes me feel smart. This massive document is the list of foreign aid to Ukraine during this war. And by foreign aid we mean\nlike weapons and ammunition. I printed it in black and white. I really want color flags. That's the whole reason I printed it. Can we reprint this? I need color flags. I'm going to print a new\none with colored flags. Okay, here it comes, pressing print. I'm getting my color list. No, I didn't print every single\npage, I just printed a few. I just really like color flags. The point is that none of us can fathom how much military hardware\nhas been delivered by the west to Ukrainians\nto fight this war. If you just glance at a few pages of this meticulously\nbuilt Wikipedia article it just starts to blow your mind. Like who knew that Portugal was giving 10 million Euros worth of military support to\nUkrainian armed forces? Wait till you get to the United States\nsection of this thing. Not only is it billions and billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, but then it's loads of\nreally advanced equipment. Javelin anti-tank missiles,\nfive helicopters, 200 shotguns 200 machine guns, 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition,\njust a thousand pistols 400 machine guns, anti personnel\nmunitions, sounds horrible. 15 tactical vehicles, 50 armored humvees. By the way, can we all just appreciate that we live in a time\nwhere there are people who spend their days\nassembling all of this on an open source\nplatform like Wikipedia so that all of us can read\nit and yes, we have to go and fact check it and make\nsure it's well sourced. All glory be to the people\nwho assembled this list. So not surprisingly Putin is not loving all of this support. So this was the West counter move. It was sanctions and unfathomable amounts of military hardware sent to Ukraine. But wait, let's be clear\nwhat's happening here. The west is not giving billions\nof dollars worth of weapons and support to Ukraine out of\nthe goodness of their hearts. This is a calculated response\nin an escalating conflict. The west has to show\ntheir adversary Russia that there's a cost to\nall of this behavior, otherwise Putin would get really\ncomfortable stealing land. But again, the west\ncan't interfere directly. So they've been forced to fuel\nthis conflict using Ukraine as their proxy to push back Russia. Oh boy, here comes the backlash. Yes, I just called this a\nproxy war and lots of people in the west don't really\nlike to frame it this way because it's literally a talking point of Russia's foreign minister that this is a proxy war from the west. But that's what it is. Let's be real about it. It really is the West's only move here. It's the best thing we could do. International relations nerds. I will see you down in the comments for a nice healthy debate on this point. The rest of us, let's move on. - A senior NATO official is warning that a potential Russian\nnuclear strike would almost certainly trigger a physical\nresponse from many allies. - So needless to say things are kind of\nescalating in this conflict. Putin keeps flexing saying that he's considering\nusing nuclear weapons and reminding us that he's very serious. Okay, wait a minute. This whole like I'm\nnot bluffing like isn't that exactly what someone\nsays when they're bluffing? Putin get a better poker face, bro. He's not using nukes anytime soon. And God, I hope I'm not wrong on that. Like imagine the apology\nvideo I'll be making if I'm wrong on this prediction. Anyway, the point I'm\ntrying to make here is that nukes are not the\nnext move for Putin. He's got one more massive trick up his sleeve and it looks like this. These pipelines and the\ngas that flows through them these pipelines are the umbilical cord between Russia and Europe. They're the result of years of a mutually beneficial relationship because Russia who's\ngot tons of natural gas is able to serve the demand in European countries who\nhave built their economies off of that natural gas. For a long time this was a very mutually beneficial relationship. I mean look at all these European leaders and Putin in 2012 and they're talking about this new pipeline they're\nopening and they're giddy and excited because they're\nall cooperating on energy. Putin gets loads of money. Europe gets natural gas to\nbuild their economy off of, everyone's happy. - I believe in natural gas,\ngas will be supplied directly by the shortest route linking\nthe major Russian gas reserves to European markets. We can guarantee this - But it turns out this was a trap. What it ended up doing\nis putting a huge amount of leverage in the hands of this guy. A weapon that he's now using in this war. Putin's government has a controlling stake in the biggest gas company\nin Russia, which means that Putin himself can\ngive the order to turn off the taps on these\npipelines, turn them off. And that's exactly what he did. - European gas prices again reached near record highs on Monday. - Gas prices up 43% last week. - Gas crop says it's\nindefinitely holding the flow of gas through our key pipelines. - We are working hard\nto become independent of this gas supply. - And the question I always have when I hear this big news of like prices and I see graphs is like\nwhat does this actually mean for Europeans? To understand that you have\nto look at one more graph. What we see here is that Europeans need their natural gas most in the winter when they burn\nthat gas to heat their homes or to make electricity\nto keep their lights on during darker days. But it's not just heating homes. This cheap abundant gas from Russia has been a foundational\naspect of European economies, especially in Germany, which by far is the most reliant on\nthis cheap gas from Russia. You just gotta look at a place like this. It's a town that is basically just a giant chemical plant in Germany. It's the biggest gas\nguzzler in the country. But I mean like come on, chemical plant kind of sounds\nboring, unimportant, right? Like we can do without chemicals for a bit while we get\nthrough this crisis. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's what I thought for a moment. I was like chemicals, that sounds like some like, like what are people doing chemistry in there with natural gas? Like I was, I was not aware. I started tracing down all of\nthe products that are linked to this specific German\nchemical plant and it's wild. I mean next time you're\ndriving down the road and you see one of these\nlike weird looking buildings with a bunch of pipes,\ngive it like a salute because inside of this\nplant they're making ammonia which is used to make fertilizer which is used to grow your food. They make the menthol for your toothpaste and they make make tons of\nchemicals that are necessary for building cars, which is\nGermany's biggest export I didn't really grasp this before but I now see that our\nmodern industrial economy is like founded on chemicals and you need a lot of natural\ngas to make chemicals. So as Russia strangles\nEurope from natural gas it's having an effect on paper\nand steel and so much more. You need energy for all this stuff. So when the cost of energy goes up the cost of everything goes up. - Inflation and soaring\nprices are biting hard. - The price of olive\noil has gone up by 27%. - Consumer prices in\nGermany reach 8% higher than one year earlier. That's a level not seen\nsince the 1970s oil crisis. - And this is exactly what Putin wants. This is his next move in the war. And notice the timing here. It's about to get really cold in Europe. Another mind blowing fact here is that 70% of the energy that is used by European households is\njust to heat the homes. 70% and about half of European homes rely on natural gas for heat. And where does that natural gas come from? Russia, well no, not Russia. It doesn't come from Russia anymore. It now needs to come from somewhere else somewhere that doesn't have a bunch of pipelines that can pipe it in cheaply. It's either that or\nEuropeans freeze this winter. Cue the current panic in Europe. (speaking in foreign language) - Two of our producers, Jack and Paji were recently in Berlin and I asked them to go look\nfor electric heaters to see if like it was easy to buy them. Like is this panic real - Is this thing on? - Hey Johnny. - We're about to like walk\ninto an electronics store and see if this is actually true and people are buying these\nelectric heaters like crazy (speaking in foreign language) This is actually happening. They had like five or six\nstill in the store on display but he said they have\nnothing left back in storage. And once those five or\nsix radiators are sold, they're not getting new ones. - Electric heater sales all over Germany seem to be going up. 76% this year over last by one estimate. Okay, but I hate to\nbreak it to you Germany. The electricity that you need to run these electric heaters is now\nway more expensive too because natural gas is also\nused to make electricity and it drives up the price for all other forms of\nelectricity as well. So yeah, Putin played his big wild card in this economic war by\nturning off the taps. And let's walk through\nhis calculations here cause it wasn't just to like make European suffer as payback. He has an end game. His goal is that by doing so\nthe people will get fed up and go to their leaders and be like why are we supporting a war\nin Ukraine at our own expense? And under pressure the leaders\nin Europe would then fracture and be more likely to go\nto President Zelenskyy who they have lots of\nleverage over and pressure him into making a deal with\nPutin to stop the war give Putin all the land that\nhe's annexed and move on. - President Putin has announced the annexation of four regions of Ukraine that are controlled by Russian forces in the biggest seizure of territory in Europe\nsince the second world war. - And this would mean a big win for Putin. Moves and counter moves,\nthat's what this is. And let me just say Putin's\nplan is not not working. This is happening right now\nand it's changing every day. So by the time you're watching it, boy things could have changed. But there is a growing movement especially in Germany to\nprotest the sanctions. and this military aid to Ukraine. (speaking in foreign language) People are taking to the streets, they're fed up with higher prices for something they\ndon't think is worth it. (speaking in foreign language) And as winter comes and the\ndemand for gas increases to heat homes and keep the economy alive this tension will only get worse. Just as Putin planned using\nhis energy weapon just at the right time to\ninflict the most amount of pain on Europe's economy. (speaking in foreign language) Okay, wait a minute, did you catch this? We're talking about like high\nstakes, like global conflict and Putin is invoking this folk tale in which a clever fox\npresumably Putin himself outsmarts this dumb wolf\nby tricking him to going down to a frozen lake and putting his tail in a hole in the ice to\ntry to like catch fish. But eventually the wolf's tail\nfreezes and the wolf is stuck until a bunch of villagers\ncome down and beat him up. By the way, I talked\nto a Russian about this and she told me that like the fox is not portrayed as like\na a role model here. Like the fox is actually like\na pretty unsavory character. And yet Putin wants to be the fox, and the EU is the wolf. Putin man, he's just\nquite the storyteller. So that is what is going\ndown here in this conflict. It is hybrid warfare with\na particular 2022 flavor, something we've never seen before and we don't really\nknow what happens next. It's developing right\nnow, but allow me to share with you a few closing\nfacts that we should keep in mind that will help us make\nsense of this economic war. First, turning off the pipelines to Europe doesn't just hurt\nEurope it hurts Russia too. In the short term they've\nbeen making tons of money off of this surge in natural gas prices. But in doing so, they\nhave severed their ties with their best highest\npaying customer, Europe. They're now looking east for new customers maybe in China and India but none will pay the prices\nthat Europe was willing to. Oh, and plus they don't\nhave nearly the network of pipelines that they have into Europe. Building those takes decades. But somehow this was worth it to Russia to inflict short term pain on Europe in exchange for a long term\nhit to Russia's gas industry. Second, and speaking of long term, yes this is painful for Europe right now but what it's gonna do is\nquickly force them to look for new places to find their energy. Spoiler alert, in the short term Qatar is gonna get way\nrich off of all of this. Richer than they already\nare, if you can imagine. But the point is that this will accelerate Europe's already started\ntransition away from fossil fuels. They're now being forced to speed that up. In other words, if they can\nweather this difficult time they will come out way better\noff than they did before. And Putin will come away with way less economic leverage over them. And this gets to my last point and this is a little bit more\nof my opinion and prediction on the situation, which is\nthat this guy, Vladimir Putin I think has overplayed his hand once again using all of his leverage in one swoop and dramatically underestimating\nits ability to work. I mean, just go back. He miscalculated his\narmy's ability to take over Ukraine's capital very swiftly. He miscalculated his army's\nability to hold land. He miscalculated the response of the Ukrainian military and\npeople to resist his invasion. He miscalculated the response\nfrom the west and now it seems like he once again has\nmiscalculated his ability to force Europe to stop supporting Ukraine through energy blackmail. He seems to be 0 for\nfive, which is good news until you realize that every time he loses one of these bets, he\nescalates the conflict. What's scary is that Putin can't lose. He's not allowed to. If he loses, he gets thrown\nout of power back home. So I think he'll keep digging in his heels using all of the tricks in his arsenal. I'm not totally sure\nwhere it goes from here but I can tell you that this\nconflict is far from over. Thank you for watching this\nvideo and you're still here, look at you, you're\nstill watching this video even after it's kind of over. I am really excited about\nwhat we're doing here. We are building more and\nmore really exciting videos and there are more people\nbehind the scenes than ever. We have revamped our\nPatreon to give you more behind the scenes of\nhow this stuff is made, how we actually do this. Every month we release a\nvideo that is just a kind of chaotic, way less sort\nof polished and edited look at the behind the scenes\nhere in the studio and out in my travels.

I interviewed several experts for this story that you didn't see. They're super informative. You can see that on Patreon. Most importantly, though,\npatrons are supporting this work, they're allowing us to do more of it to make it more journalistically rigorous and factually accurate. That's what I wanna do more of.

    "captions": "(birds chirping) (gentle music playing) - I'm looking into North Korea\nfor the first time in my life and it's kind of surreal. I'm up here on a rooftop, and I'm seeing two giant flag poles. (gentle music playing) I mean, that is a massive flag pole. You go over this wall, and you're not actually\nin North Korea yet. You're in a no man's land, a four-mile-thick demilitarized zone that effectively comprises the border. I came to this border because I want to understand\nthis in a new way. I'm tired of watching this. - The intensifying\nshowdown with North Korea. - The North Koreans\nare in no mood to talk. They're in the mood of\ntesting and blowing things up. - Getting one very\nspecific version fed to me about what this conflict is about. - Rogue regime (indistinct) - Nuclear testing is a big deal. - Another nuclear test at any time. - Who it's between, why it exists. - The missile that North Koreans launched is something the US has never seen before. - Kim's stockpile of nuclear weapons. - Capable of hitting the\ncontinental United States. - Instead I want to see it for myself, to talk to the people who\nlive in South Korea's capital, a city of 10 million people\nthat is 40 kilometers from this border. I hear there's a lot of bomb shelters and so I want to go see\nwhat those look like. So I want to show you\nthis peculiar border, what it looks like, what it feels like, and most importantly, how it got here. (fast music playing) Not fed through western diplomacy, military policy and media coverage, but rather what it actually\nlooks like on the ground. (fast music playing) (gentle music playing) I'm drowning in some\nof the coolest evidence I've ever touched in my life which are original\ntelegrams between Stalin and Kim Il-Sung. I've got a ton of this stuff, and frankly, it's very, very useful for\nunderstanding this border, this line that divided\nthe Korean Peninsula. What I first need to do\nis thank today's sponsor who made this ambitious video possible. CoPilot is a platform where\nyou get paired with a fitness coach one-on-one. It's like a personalized coach, and you get to craft a fitness\nplan that works for you. I went through the whole\nprocess of getting paired up with a coach. Hey Donny, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Is there any injury, things or pains that I need to be cognizant of? - Then I got to have my first workout. It shows me what I'm supposed to do. The best part about this is\nthat it's tailored to my life. Like what I can actually do, how much time I actually\nwant to spend doing this? CoPilot makes it so much\neasier to fit exercise into your life. - What are you using? - I forgot my dumbbells,\nso I'm using the sandbags here in the studio. So much of what we hear\nabout fitness is focused on transforming how you look. What I love about CoPilot, it's about consistent movement\nto improve how you feel, how your mind works and what\nyou can do with your body. I am so in line with those values. After a workout, I could let them know if something was off or if I wanted to change the focus. Workout was good today, I do wish that there was more. And I could get a response with additional feedback\nbeing implemented into future workouts. You get unlimited back\nand forth in app texting with your coach and\nunlimited video calls like it's really amazing. So if this sounds interesting to you, you can get 14 days for free\nwith your own expert fitness, and health coach at the\nlink in my description. It's go.mycopilot.com/JohnnyHarris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel as always, but it also gets you in on\nthis deal of two weeks for free to start your journey with CoPilot. I've loved it and I think you will too. So with that, let's get back to North Korea. This line, this peninsula, we've all heard something about it. I studied this line a lot in\ncollege and in grad school at the think tank I worked at. But for this story, I wanted to throw out\nall of that training, all of that perspective. I wanted to approach it with a new lens, one not steeped in the\nassumptions and biases of American foreign policy,\nmedia and military thinking. So let me show you my new\nperspective on how this line came to be. Korea was an independent, unified place until the early\n1900s when Japan annexed it as part of their conquest of Asia. Then the world responded\nbeating them back and crushing this growing empire. That's World War II. The winners of the war got\ntogether and decided that yes, we just liberated Korea from Japan. But no, they are not ready\nto be independent just yet. The two most powerful allies\ndecided that they would each occupy half of the peninsula\nfor up to five years. Then Koreans could have\none independent country, this whole peninsula. Most Koreans, of course, hated this more colonizers\nusing their peninsula as a military base, but the\ngreat powers didn't really care. So late one night in 1945, right before Japan surrendered,\ntwo US military leaders got together here in the Pentagon\nand pulled out this map. This map actually. This is a 1942 National Geographic map that these two military\nleaders used to split Korea. They eyeballed this peninsula\nand they proposed this line here at 38 North. It's like a latitude line. And surprisingly to\nthem, the Soviets agreed. - 38 parallel border of North Korea. - With this line the Americans\nwere trying to get Seoul, which was Korea's capital\non their side of the line, which they did by just like 40 kilometers. Oh, and just to be clear here, this line, the 30th parallel wasn't\nsome natural border. It wasn't a linguistic or cultural border. But again, the whole idea was that this was just going to be temporary. It's going to last five years. Two great powers dividing\nland with maps temporarily. What could go wrong? Okay, so what's the deal\nwith the Soviet Union, and the United States in this moment? You have to remember that they were allies after World War II, because they had fought a\ncommon enemy banding together to crush the Nazi empire in Europe. And then the Soviets\njoined in over here in Asia kind of last second to\nhelp deal the final blows to the Japanese empire. So these two superpowers were friends. I mean, I have direct proof of this. Check out a picture of my\ngrandpa in the late forties on the Korean peninsula. He's standing right up here on the border between the Soviet Union and Korea, and he's hanging out\nwith the Soviet soldier with a big smile on his face. The Soviets and Americans were allies, they were friends, they\nhad worked together here. But very quickly they started\nto realize how much they actually weren't friends\nand that they thought very differently about how\nthe world should work. And in fact, now that other big\nempires were out of the way, the entire world was now a\nchessboard open for them to make their moves to ensure that their ideology would become the new way of the world. Yes, we want to give Korea\nback to the Koreans said, the Soviet Union and the United States, but will it be an American\nfriendly capitalist society or a Soviet friendly communist society? Meanwhile, the local Koreans, at least most of them\nwere hating all of this. But there was one Korean\nwho was not hating it, the new leader of the Soviet\nbacked North Kim Il-Sung, who was a war guy, he rose up as a fighter in\nChina's communist revolution and was picked to then lead\nthe communist part of Korea. Kim wanted to unite the\npeninsula under communism with force, but he couldn't do that without\nthe blessing of his Soviet supporters, mainly this guy Joseph Stalin. And this is where the evidence\nwe found gets pretty juicy. - Among communists. Kim is the last to maintain\na personality cult. - Okay, check these out. These are telegrams and\nconversations between Joseph Stalin and Kim Il-Sung. I mean, this is like when\nyou are looking at original conversations in the original\ntext from these great leaders, which have since been\ndeclassified by the presidential archives in Moscow. You learn more from this\nthan you do from any textbook or any master's degree because this is like the horse's mouth. This is what they were actually saying. You start to get the first\ninsights into how the Cold War would start to play out. The logic, the calculations,\nthe fears, the goals. Okay, so it's 1949. Kim Il-Sung immediately goes\nto Stalin asking for support and weapons to invade the south, to unite the peninsula\nunder the communist flag. Not surprisingly Stalin is\nvery interested in communism winning out on the Korean peninsula. But you read these conversations\nand you see that he's also kind of freaked out. The Americans are there, and a direct conflict with these\ntwo superpowers is a recipe for another global war. Plus China, which is\nanother communist ally, is currently in a big civil war. They're not going to be able\nto help Kim out in his efforts. So Stalin basically says no. But then the next year, 1950\nthree big things change. (suspense music playing) Stalin sends a note to\nKim saying he's quote, \"ready to help him in this matter,\" tells him to come to Moscow. Thing number one, Stalin got intel from one\nof his spies in Washington that South Korea wasn't that\nimportant to the Americans. And if that there was an invasion, the Americans probably\nwouldn't do anything. US troops were leaving the peninsula. Thing number two, and this is a big freaking deal. Stalin says it right here, that quote, \"the USSR\nnow has the atomic bomb\" ending, the US' atomic monopoly. That changes everything. And thing number three, and again, we see this\nin another conversation. Stalin says to Kim, in one of these meetings, the communist in China had\njust won their civil war. They control China now. They're not busy with the Civil War, and they'll be able to help\nwith an invasion of South Korea. With these three major developments, Stalin now feels secure\nthat the US won't come to \"challenge the communists in Asia.\" It would be an easy victory. Oh, and at the end of\nall these conversations, Stalin is like, side\nnote, we will support you, we will give you weapons, but we're not going to send troops. Go ask Mao for those, which\nis exactly what he did. So do you see what's happening here? This is like Cold War like crash course. It is spies. Prevailing mood is not\nto interfere in the US. It is global ideological alliances. China's victory is also\nimportant psychologically. And it is nuclear deterrence. The USSR now has the atomic bomb. The seeds of the Cold War are sprouting. - After three years of preparation, the Soviet Union and its North\nKorean propers were ready. Troops and military equipment\npoured down from the north. - So then early one\nmorning in June of 1950, it happened some 75,000\nsoldiers from the north blast across this line, a line that two American military\nguys had drawn five years earlier. - June 25th, 1950, the communist strike. - And as Kim Il-Sung predicted, his troops quickly took over\nnearly the entire peninsula. But Stalin's calculation was wrong. Back in Washington, President Truman wasn't going\nto let the communist take over the Korean peninsula. - The future of civilization\ndepends on what we do, on what we do now. - He got ready for war, bypassing Congress to prepare\nto get a bunch of UN nations together to come to Korea's rescue. - Like obstacles, United Nations forces drive\non to the 38th parallel border of North Korea. - The details of what\nhappened next are astounding, and frankly, I have no\nidea why I didn't learn these details in school. This was a brutal and long\nwar, incredibly destructive. The entire peninsula was ripped apart, but an important detail for this story is what the US Air force\ndid up here in the north. - The versatility of Air Forces\nwas proved as never before. - With their new jet powered aircraft. They quickly established\nair superiority and dropped an unfathomable amount of\nexplosives onto North Korea. Like it's hard to quantify,\nbut to put it into perspective, the US Air Force dropped\nmore bombs on North Korea in this three year period than\nthey did during the entire Pacific Theater of World War II. - After identifying their targets, our planes swooped down like avenging, shadows of death and destruction. - The US Air Force targeted\nbasically anything that moved, villages, towns, buildings, factories, and very importantly dams. - US carrier based planes take off, their target the vital\nhydroelectric power plants south of the Yalo River. - Unleashing a flood of water\nthat washed away villages and killed the water supply to\nrice and other crops leading to an excruciatingly slow\nstarvation of the people who started living in a\nnetwork of underground caves to escape the bombardment\nof their country. - An advance whose purpose\ngeneral Richway states is not to seize ground, but\nto wipe out the enemy. - In the end, 85% of all buildings in\nNorth Korea were destroyed. 85%. - Communists have finally\nlaunched they're undeclared, all out war of conflict. - Now, wait, I know what you're\nthinking if you're familiar with this conflict, which is\nthat this entire peninsula got slammed. It wasn't just the north, the north and the south. Seoul was turned to dust as well. This was a horrifying war. The reason I'm highlighting\nthe utter destruction, and the aerial bombardment of the north is because what the US Air Force did here, this memory became a foundational\nmemory for these people. It would go on to inform the\nrest of the country's history to this day. This memory would not fade. This horrific war went on\nfor three years until 1953 when they signed a ceasefire\nfreezing the frontline of the war where it was on the\nday they signed right here. The agreement was to take this\nline and put a two kilometer buffer on each side, declaring it a zone where no\nmilitary activity can occur. A de-militarized zone. So where I'm standing now\nis the de-militarized zone, the DMZ. No military stuff allowed\nwithin this four kilometer thick buffer zone up here, North\nKorea, down here, South Korea, and these borders are\nsome of the most fortified and militarized lines on our planet. After the war, the American\nmilitary never went home, and since then, there have been\ntens of thousands of troops on this peninsula. Oh, and crucially, the US stored nuclear\nweapons on this peninsula during the Cold War, providing South Korea with the\nsecurity they needed to turn into a thriving, advanced democracy, helping them build their country\nto move on from the trauma and pain of this war. And like I said earlier,\nNorth Korea did the opposite. They didn't move on. They stayed fixated on what\nhappened during those three years of horror, continuing to build up\nanti-aircraft defenses, underground bunkers and tunnels. And over the course of decades, their Soviet supporters\nhelped them learn the science of nuclear energy that by 2006\nturned into nuclear weapons. North Korea becoming the eighth\ncountry to possess the most destructive weapons in the world. And as the Soviet Union\ncollapsed and cut off all of its support, North Korea used\nthis one weapon to stay in the conversation to ensure that they would\nnever find themselves in this situation again. (gentle music playing) As one historian from\nColumbia University said. North Korea never forgot the lessons of their vulnerability\nfrom American airstrikes, and that the long term\npsychological effects of the war on the whole\nof North Korean society cannot be overestimated. The war against the United\nStates more than any other single factor, gave North Koreans a\ncollective sense of anxiety, and fear of outside threats\nthat would continue long after the wars end. North Korea keeps this\nmemory alive through horrific imagery. There's actually a museum\njust south of Pongy that's dedicated to the\natrocities committed by the United States. You walk into this place and\nit is full of horrific imagery like paintings of Americans\ndoing terrible things to North Koreans. I'm not going to show you\nany of this propaganda here because it is gruesome and horrifying. Oh and the target audience of this museum, Children. Every year young children make\na pilgrimage to this museum to witness these images\nand affirm in their minds their hatred for the United States, and their desire for revenge Keeping alive this memory from the 1950s. The regime keeps this memory\nalive to keep their people scared and oppressed,\nconstantly ready for war. Back in Seoul. Every few years, North Korea comes out and\nsays that they are ready and willing to turn this\ncity into a sea of fire or a pile of ashes, and frankly, they have the tools to do it. Up here on this border, there are over 10,000\nbig military guns pointed at this city. These guns have a range\nof over 60 kilometers, which put Seoul very much in range. Luckily, people in this city are ready. There are over 3000\nbomb shelters sprinkled throughout Seoul, and that is\nwhat I'm looking for today. Luckily, the government made\nan app to show the people of Seoul where all of\nthese bomb shelters are. Wait, this is the bomb shelter. I mean, I guess we're underground, but like barely. I got to talk to one of these shop owners, see what they think. Did you know that this\nwas a bomb shelter,? I guess is the question. (speaking Korean) - That one was just a shopping mall. Come on, let's go\nsomewhere else on the map. Wait, so the next bomb shelter\non this map is a Starbucks. What? So did you know that\nthere's a bomb shelter over? - I didn't know that.\nI've never noticed that. - So this is it. This is the bomb shelter. The basement of this apartment complex. Let's go visit another one I guess. We've reached another shelter. Now I'm really in a bomb shelter. Oh, actually it's just\nanother parking garage. What is this? If we had to rush down\nhere, is there water? Is there extra food? Is there some way to seal it\noff so that chemical weapons don't get down here? No. It's literally an\nunchanged parking garage. Not retrofitted, not special in any way. I'm starting to lose faith\nin the idea that these bomb shelters are anything but just\nnormal city infrastructure that have signs on them that\nsay, these are bomb shelters. Do these people not realize\nthey live 40 kilometers from North Korea? - I'm making a video about sort\nof the American perspective, of North Korea, which is like. Have you ever thought\nthrough like a scenario of like what you would\ndo in case of an attack? - Oh. - No. - You don't. (speaking Korean) - I've actually never thought about it. (speaking Korean) (speaking Korean) (speaking Korean) - We just hate the regime and oh my God. I can't do this. I hate pigeons so much. - Are you more afraid of\npigeons than North Korea? - Yeah. Where were we? - We were talking about. As I told you, I've lived here for my whole\nlife and I've seen them like testing nuclear weapons, but like we don't really care. - Now listen, let me just be frank, I'm slightly playing up my ignorance here. I kind of knew that this was the case, but I also kind of didn't, as an American who studied this conflict through an American foreign policy lens, my hunt for bomb shelters and\nthe subsequent conversations with locals drove home just\nhow little the people here actually think about North Korea. - I don't think I've ever met\nanyone in Korea who was like really worried about that. (speaking Korean) - Kim Jong-un doesn't do\nthis to threaten South Korea. They do this to threaten\nus, the United States, the military that turned\ntheir country into dust in the 1950s, the country that they are\ntechnically still at war with. Back up here at the border, you can see what the conflict\nactually looks like today between north and south. There's occasional violence, but the conflict today\nis often more petty. Who can build the largest flag pole? Who can blast the loudest\nmusic at each other? North Korea comically building\na fake city to look more prosperous and a competition\nof who can look the scariest. You realize that it's not\nactually scary or threatening to be here. If anything, it's just plain sad. It's sad to see 70 years of this standoff, this needless standoff that was created by powerful outsiders. And once again, what we see is that the people\nwho share the same history, and culture and language, but are divided, continue to be the ones\nthat suffer from this. (birds chirping) After my time in the DMZ, I decided to set aside the\nhistory, the bluster, the fear, just for a moment to\nexperience this place. Not as an American taught\nto see this region purely in terms of conflict, but to experience it as the\npeople here experience it. The people here in this\ncity that is unrecognizable from the devastation of the 50s, a city that has moved on. It is a Saturday night\nhere in Seoul South Korea, the sun is going down. I spent the night traversing this city, immersing myself in what it has to offer, from the nightclubs to barbecue, to small underground clubs, watching DJ competitions and sipping soju. Then to a street party in\nthe middle of the night where a bunch of young\npeople are protesting the forced eviction and planned demolition of this historic pub, One of Seoul's oldest institutions\nfor beer and dried fish. They've been doing this\nevery night for months. Yes, North Korea is 40 kilometers away. I'm very aware of that. There's a real threat here, a dangerous oppressive\nregime with powerful weapons. But the threat presents very\ndifferently for the people here, much differently\nthan the fear that we feel an ocean away. I walked away from Korea with\na much clearer understanding of this conflict. This conflict that was\nstarted by North Korea, fueled by Cold War dynamics\nand remains an active war between North Korea and the\nUnited States of America.

So their job is to set the rules or\u00a0\npolicies that all the other banks have to follow.\u00a0\u00a0 And the central bank isn\u2019t motivated by profit,\u00a0\nbut rather their job is to babysit the economy,\u00a0\u00a0 to keep it growing, to make sure people have jobs,\u00a0\nto make sure that prices don't fluctuate too much,\u00a0\u00a0 so that we can keep growing nicely.

You're going to be way more likely\u00a0\u00a0 to do that if you only have to pay 2% interest on\u00a0\nthat loan as opposed to like 6%.

    "captions": "- [Interviewer] Do you know how many feet there are in a mile? - [Interviewee] 3,000-something. - [Johnny] This is the moment I realized I will never use the metric system. Okay, let's see how far\nyou can jump. Ready? My six year old is constantly asking me to measure how far he can jump. - I have to get on that. - [Johnny] Okay, I'm gonna count it. Ready, set, go. And inevitably, this ends up happening. Okay, stay there, stay there. One, two, three... That was two meters. - No, it was six. No, remember you got... - [Johnny] Oh, six feet, yeah. Oh, whoof. - [Son] Yeah. - You're right. (upbeat music) The entire world uses the\nsame measuring system, except for three countries. So, you have the richest,\nmost powerful country, and then you have this\nsmall African nation that the US kind of invented\nto, like, ship slaves back to. It's a weird situation that\nI made a whole video about. Totally different. And then you have Myanmar,\na Southeast Asian country that used to be called Burma. You don't see maps like this very often, where the whole world is one color, and then you have three random countries peppered across the globe\nthat are a different color. And I'm looking at you, Britain. I know that you're green on this map, but we all know you still kinda dabble in pounds, and pints, and miles. I want to show you\nexactly how this happened, and show you why I will\nnever use the metric system. - If somebody runs a 5K, I have no idea what that\ntranslates into miles. - [Announcer] A thousand two-step\npaces of a Roman soldier. - We have no reason to be ashamed\nfor using feet and pounds. - [Narrator] Now, many\ncalculations are merely a matter of moving the decimal point. - It's one of the great\nthings about Americans, is: we won't change no mater\nhow good it would be for us. (intense instrumental music) - Hey, real quick. We'll get back to metric in just a second, but I need to thank today's sponsor, because that's how I run a business so I can make these videos for you. The sponsor of today's video is NordVPN, which is a brand that has\nsupported this channel for a long time now,\nand I'm very grateful. A VPN is a thing that sounds\nreally fancy and technical, but it basically just allows you to connect to the internet\nvia a different country. This is useful for a lot of reasons. I've been traveling a lot lately and I've been able to use NordVPN to connect to my internet\nvia the United States so that all of my Gmail\nand accounts don't think that I'm, like, a hacker\nin a different country. This is very, very useful to me, especially in a world of endless two-factor authentication death loops that I've been in many times\nwhen I'm in other countries. It's amazing how a little\naffordable tool can just fix that. And that's what NordVPN does. Oh, and by the way, its not some, like, coding tech-boy thing. You just literally press a button and you're connected to a VPN. It also works the other way:\nif I'm in the United States and want to connect to the Internet via Canada, or the UK, or India, I suddenly get access to all of the things that Canadians and British people see when they log onto Netflix. It's pretty cool. Oh, and NordVPN also has this new thing called threat protection which basically, when it's turned on, you\ncan surf the Internet and not worry about\ntrackers and malicious ads and malware and all of these things that you just don't want to worry about when you're on the Internet. So there's a link in my description: it's nordvpn.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gets you\nin on an exclusive deal where you can sign up for NordVPN and get four months for free. Oh, and you get 30 days to decide if you are gonna use this or\nnot and if it's useful to you, and a you can get all of\nyour money back if it's not. Pretty good deal. Let's get back to why I will\nnever use the metric system. (upbeat instrumental music) The first thing humans measured was time. You think of, like, sun, moon, stars, sundials, constellations. This was pretty easy because we're all looking up at the same night sky. It basically does the same\nthing every day and every night. Totally reliable and unchanging. Measuring stuff like weight\nand length is way harder, and for a long time, the best thing we had was our bodies. - Humans are about this big. So we've always wanted a\nunit of measurement about this long. The earliest unit of measurement that we know of is the cubit, which was basically the\nlength of a forearm. Not super precise, because we all have\ndifferent-sized forearms, but it got the job done, at least in the case of building giant pyramids in Cairo, or in Noah's ark, which was\napparently 300 of these puppies. Over time, humans needed to measure bigger and longer things, so they began using their\ndaily activities as references, which was mostly just\nlike, a lot of farming. Like the acre, which\nwas the amount of land that a farmer could\nmanage to plow in a day. Or the hundred-weight which was kind of how much a man could\ncarry on his back comfortably. Because, yeah, it's the\nsame for everyone, right? - What say you, Corey? - More weight! - So by the 1700s, there was, like, a billion ways of measuring things. But up here, they had a few popular ones. So you've got the foot, which was, well, the average length of a man's foot. This is a ruler that you\nalways have handy with you. Handy. Hand, foot. Handy. Right? Should we keep that? - [Crew Member 1] Fuck. - [Crew Member 2] No, absolutely not. (upbeat music) - And then you've got the\ninch, which, in the 1300s, was decreed as three grains\nof barley laid end-to-end. - From the midst of the ear. Right. Who knows what a barley corn is. - Super convenient, right? (cartoon sound effects) Who needs a measuring tape when you could just bring\naround a little pouch of all your barley corns\nto measure things with. And then there was the yard, which was the average measurement\naround someone's chest. And then King Henry shows\nup in England, and is like, \"We need to standardize\nthe yard using my body.\" And for a while there in England,\nit was King Henry's body, like the length from\nhis nose to his thumb, or like, the length of his arm, that was used to derive all of\nthese yard-like measurements. It was his literal body. Like, that's what they were using. And then there's the mile,\nwhich is the distance covered by Roman soldiers\nwalking one thousand paces. They then somehow discovered that the mile was roughly about eight furlongs, furlongs, of course, being the distance that a team of oxen could\nplow without resting. The pound was defined at the weight of seven thousand grains. 6,987. 6,988. (sighs) This is really terrible. What is happening? I mean, all of these measurements seem so tenuous and inconsistent. And they were. 6,999. 7,000. We've got a pound,\neveryone. We've got a pound! It was madness! (aggressive instrumental music) Meanwhile, down here in\nFrance, in the late 1700s, they were dealing with their own madness, and it had nothing to\ndo with measurements. At this time, the French were\nbeheading kings and queens, and they were drinking lots of coffee, and sitting around in\nsalons doing science things. The people of France wanted to\nchange just about everything, and the measurement systems were not off the table in these discussions. So in the middle of all\nof this Enlightenment, they look at each other and they're like, \"Why the hell are we using our\nforearms to measure stuff\"? They needed something precise. Not like barley corns and forearms, but something that they could peg their new measurement system to that was an unchanging baseline. \"How about the literal planet we live on?\" said the coffee-drinking\nFrench science guys. \"We should measure this\ndistance right here, \"and divide it by ten a bunch of times, \"and get a really precise unit of measure \"so that we don't have to\nuse our feet and arms.\" Great idea! But how the hell do you get this massive measurement in 1792? And the answer was this\nthing, plus some math. So these two French astronomers go out into the French countryside, looking for high up places\nlike hills or castle towers. And then, they look\nthrough this fancy little platinum map telescope and measure the angles between two\npoints out in the distance. This fancy telescope allows\nthem to make this measurement without having to walk\nthese whole distances. And in this way, they could start making little triangles across\nthe French countryside. And then, using some basic math that we all learned in middle school, they could start to calculate\na hyper-accurate distance along this straight line. It took them seven years\nto calculate all of this, but they got it! And once they had this distance, they were able to calculate this distance: between the north pole and the equator, one-fourth of the earth's circumference. So they took this line, this measurement, and they chopped it up into\n10 million little parts and one of those parts\nis called a 'meter'. Like, this is pegged to a\nreal unchanging measurement that is our Earth! I mean, it'll change eventually. (explosion) But not in our lifetimes. The name meter comes from\nthe Greek word \"metron,\" which means \"a measurement,\" which is just super literal and precise and exactly what the French\nEnlightenment was all about. - [Announcer] Now, here's\nwhat it's all about. The meter. - So now you have this meter, and if you divide this into\na hundred smaller units, you have a centimeter. Centimeter. So put a thousand of these side by side, and you get yourself a kilometer. A kilometer. - The best part about the metric system is the time it saves in computation. - Wait a minute. I can do this. It's all about tens. So if this measurement\nwas ten million of these, divide that by a thousand, you\nget ten thousand kilometers. (upbeat trumpet music) Okay, so this is ten thousand kilometers. (upbeat trumpet music) One-fourth of the earth's circumference. (upbeat trumpet music) Four of these should be... (upbeat trumpet music) Forty thousand kilometers! (upbeat music) The earth's circumference\nis 40,000 kilometers! Wait, what? No, I don't want miles. Come on, what? It should be 40,000. What's this extra 75\nkilometers doing here? Well, it turns out that one\nof these French astronomers actually made an error\nin his calculations, making the final meter\nabout 0.2 millimeters shorter than it should have been. The guy quickly discovered\nthis, like in the middle of it, but he didn't tell anyone because support for this new system\nwas already really tenuous, and he didn't want anyone to have any more doubt or skepticism. So it turns out the metric\nsystem isn't literally perfect. Take that! Finding this measurement\nwas the hardest part. Now that they have it,\nthey were able to build an entire system purely based off of this. Let me show you. Okay, so now we want a unit for volume. Let's build a hypothetical cube that is 10 centimeters on all sides. Fill it up with liquid,\nand you have a liter. One liter. And from there, you can do the same thing that we did with meters. Centiliters, kiloliters, you name it. It's all tens, which\nmakes it so much easier to convert between these\ndifferent measurements. It's a lot easier than barley corns. Okay, so now we have a liter,\nwhich is a volume thing. Let's use this to make a\nunit for mass, AKA weight. (keyboard typing) I know they're different, but it's like, the earth's gravity makes\nweight and mass the same when you're on Earth, blah, blah, blah. I get it, commenters. I see you. I see you typing right now. Back off. You fill this liter with water,\nand now you have a kilogram. Divide that by 1000, and you have a gram. Add 1000 kilograms together,\nand you have a metric ton. I mean, it's simple. It's tens, it's hundreds, it's thousands. - [Announcer] Now, many\ncalculations are merely a matter of moving the\ndecimal point, not the pencil. - Okay, so now they have all these units that are scientific and standardized and founded on concepts\nof exact measurements. And this is really the first\ntime that humans ever had this. The Frenchmen all looked at\neach other and were like, \"Good work, guys, we did\nit. The coffee helped. \"This is great. What should we call it?\" And they settled on... \u266a The metric system \u266a \u266a The metric system \u266a - Okay, cool, great system. But why don't I use the metric system? What happened? Well, that has to do with pirates and international politics. So France is like, this\nsystem works pretty damn well. We're impressed with ourselves. We should tell the rest\nof the world posthaste. So it's the late 1700's, and France going around country by country with a literal meter stick, being like, \"Hey guys, look what we invented. \"It's pegged to the earth. \"It's literally like we\nmeasured this entire thing, \"and you should adopt it\nbecause it's really precise. \"It's gonna make international\ntrade way more efficient.\" And people were like, \"oh, this is cool, but\nwe're a little skeptical.\" And meanwhile, in France, they\nwere still kind of skeptical. The current leader at the\ntime was this guy, Napoleon. We've all heard about him.\nAnd he was super into it. He's like, \"metric is awesome.\" You know what else he was into? Making sure everyone liked him. So when he saw that the French\npublic wasn't super jazzed about uprooting what was working for them for hundreds of years, he decided not to enforce metric by law. So France ended up in this\nweird limbo for thirty years, and meanwhile the US is\nlooking from across the ocean, and they're like, \"dude,\nmetric, it's a total fad. \"There's no way. Napoleon is wishy-washy. \"There's no way this is\nactually gonna stick. \"Let's hold off on the whole metric thing \"and just industrialize\nwith our very silly system \"that is built on, like, people's feet.\" - The metric system is\nthe tool of the devil! My car gets 40 rods to the hog's head, and that's the way I likes it! - But we'll get back\nto the US in a minute, because there's still hope. In the meantime, France\nfinally gets fully on board, and successfully sells\nnot only their public on the metric system, but the world. They're like, \"come on, guys. \"We sent two dudes out to do trigonometry \"with their golden telescopes \"for like seven years for this shit! \"Trust me, you don't want\nto do that on your own. \"Adopt the system.\" It was a tough sell at first\nto get people to switch, but eventually, they did. It started with Belgium,\nthen the Netherlands, then Luxembourg, then Algeria, a French colony, 20 years later. And then it kind of snowballed from there, partly because countries\nrealized how rational it was, but partly because Europe was taking over the world at this time, and bringing their values and language and systems to every corner\nof the globe forcibly. Ah, yes. Colonialism will make it\ninto every one of my videos. Okay, but what about the USA? Well, France had some beef\nwith the US at this point. It's kind of a long story.\nNot gonna go into it. But what's important\nto know is that the US was weirdly put in the\nmiddle between this, like, frenemy bromance gone wrong\nbetween France and England. So at first, America wasn't invited to the inner circle to\nbe introduced to metric, but as the world was adopting metric, France finally decided to send\na guy over to deliver this: a prototype of the almighty,\nultra-logical kilogram. Inviting the US to join\nthe rest of the world in this measurement revolution. There is hope for the USA to go metric. So this French ship is\nsailing across the Atlantic with the kilogram onboard and a storm hits it and\nblows it into the Caribbean, where it runs into a\ngroup of British pirates. The British pirates capture\nthe emissary from France, they imprison him, and they try to gain ransom\nfrom France for this guy. Well, they end up accidentally\nkilling the French guy, but they notice that he has a package, and the pirates are like, \"Oh,\nshit, this is addressed to \"the US Secretary of\nState Thomas Jefferson. \"Us Brits are cool with the US right now, \"so let's bring this over\nto New York and deliver it.\" Super curious pirates. I like these guys. But when they get to New York, Thomas Jefferson isn't the\nSecretary of State anymore. So they just hand it to the guy who is now the Secretary\nof State, Edmund Randolph. And Randolph is like, \"what the hell is this\nweird hunk of copper?\" So then he gives it to this\nother guy, who just keeps it. So, yeah, thanks to\ngeopolitics and pirates, the US didn't get the kilo in time to convince them to maybe adopt France's new super-logical\nsystem of measurement. Britain also refused for a long time, sticking with the system that was developed using some dude's foot, but eventually, they got on board, but not fully. They still dabble in\nsome old Imperial ways. But get this: they've changed\nsome of the Imperial things since the US became\nindependent, like their pint, which is like 25% bigger\nthan the pint here. They're both called the pint, but go get a pint of beer in the UK, and you're actually getting 4 ounces more than you would in the US. As if having one highly illogical, unreliable measuring system including feet and\nteaspoons isn't bad enough, there are now two of them floating around that have the same names! It gets real bad when\nyou look at the ounce, which is a word that is used to define several different units of\nmass, weight, or volume. Same word, bunch of different things. Okay, okay, but how hard can this be? This is my home turf. This\nis my measurement system. (Pencil sharpening) I got this. So an ounce in the UK is\none-twentieth an Imperial pint. That seems nice and easy. That's one 160th of an\nImperial gallon, approximately. There's approximately 28.41 milliliters. Kind of gross. Okay, that's the Imperial\nfluid ounce used in the UK. Okay, so then the US ounce is one-sixteenth of a US liquid pint, which is one 128th a liquid gallon, which is exactly\n29.5735295625 milliliters, making it about 4.08% larger than the Imperial fluid\nounce used in the UK. Okay, but wait. This is\njust the fluid ounce. What about the weight ounce? The one that came from, like, the seven thousand grains to be a pound. Okay, so seven thousand grains to a pound, and there's sixteen ounces to that pound, so that's 437.5 grains to an ounce. But if I want to convert the weight ounce to the fluid ounce, I just need to multiply the volume by 1.043176 times the density\nof the ingredient or material so that we can easily switch between the fluid ounce and the weight ounce, and the pound with the 7000\ngrains, and sixteenth... There's, one-sixteenth\nof a pound is the ounce. So grains are 437.5... Just convert it with\nGoogle, and you've got it. Just super easy. (sighs) Yeah, that's where we're\nat. It's a total mess. - [Interviewer] Do you know how many feet there are in a mile? - Three thousand something. - Every country on earth adopted the metric system eventually besides these three countries: the US, Myanmar, and Liberia. - The United States just\ngave the rest of the world a big finger and said,\n\"(beep) your metric system!\" - Over the years, the US has attempted really formally to go metric. Like, in the 70's and 80's,\nthere were all these debates and there were boards\ncreated by the government to find a way to migrate over to metric. But, of course, Ronald\nReagan shut it down, because of, you know, the whole\ngovernment spending thing. This was an actual public debate. Like, this documentary I\nkeep showing was from a PSA trying to convince people\nto get on board with metric. And then on the other side, in the 80's, there was this anti-metric group. Yes, anti-metric groups. That was a thing. They even hosted a gala,\nwhere they featured the Most Beautiful Foot contest. Don't you just love American culture? We just love to stick it to people. Just look at us, being\nindividuals in our own ways. But this stuff actually matters, okay? In 1999, NASA sent a satellite to Mars, and it went off-course and burned up in the planet's atmosphere all because of a misconversion\nbetween units of measure. One of the contractors\nwas using imperial units while NASA Ground was using metric, and it ended up costing\nNASA 125 million dollars. But what's interesting is\nthat the US has kind of secretly quietly got on board with metric, but it's just sort of behind the scenes in boring sectors that none\nof us really think about and that don't actually make it into all of our intuitions. It's like industry, or\nthe federal government. Or, like, nutrition labels. I don't look at nutrition\nlabels, but if I did, I would see grams and milligrams. And on liquid-based things,\nI would see milliliters, because nutrition labels are in metric. It doesn't matter that I don't really know what a gram or a kilogram\nor a milligram even is, but when I go to the pharmacy, the pharmacist gives me\nmy medicine in milligrams. Progress. (chews) So, yeah, it's pharmaceuticals, it's nutrition, it's film, it's tools, it's bicycles, it's running races. Oh, and for some reason, this\none highway sign in Arizona. For all of these efforts,\nnone of them have succeeded in getting metric into the brains of everyday people like me. And this is why I will\nnever use the metric system. I can't! I literally cannot. You don't realize how your\nintuition is calibrated in certain systems of measurements until you try to change it. I started traveling in my early 20's, really for the first time abroad. And I saw them using metric, and I saw how easy it was\nand how rational it was. And I made a commitment to myself. I'm like, I'm gonna change\nfrom my imperial intuition to adopting metric. And I even swore, I'm going to teach my future children\nmetric from an early age. And since then, over a\ndecade, I have been trying. I look at this distance, and to me, oh, that's ten meters\naway, not thirty feet. It feels like it's 20 degrees\nCelsius outside right now, I would say. Oh, yeah, it's like five\nkilometers down the road. Oh, I'm gonna pick up\ntwo kilos of short rib to make the soup tonight. But my dirty little secret is that I've totally been faking it. Ten meters doesn't mean anything to me. What it means is thirty\nfeet divided by three. What I've really been\ndoing this whole time is intuitively estimating things\nbased on the system I know, which is pegged to farming\nactivities and body parts, and then doing the rough math based on the numbers I know\nabout converting to metric. Without those conversion numbers, I honestly cannot estimate\nwhat fifty meters looks like. I can't grasp what running\nfive kilometers feels like. I don't know what\ntwenty-two centimeters is outside of the context\nof a one-foot-long ruler that I know is thirty centimeters. And so I'll never use the metric system. I don't know how, and\nI can't teach myself. I've tried. But then I had kids! There's hope. The next generation. I vowed to instill them\nwith metric intuition and found that it's\nbasically been impossible because everything they're exposed to at school, in math, on road\ntrips while we're driving, all of it is in feet and miles and cups and pints and teaspoons and tons. I mean, I try. I tell my kids measurements in meters, and my six-year-old will\nliterally respond with, \"Well, how far is that in feet?\" He is six. Like, this isn't happening. The ship has sailed on changing\nto metric here in the US for everyday people. It'll likely never happen. I'm trapped in a system that was developed using people's body parts\nand farming activities and King Henry's arm. - [Announcer] We interrupt this film to bring you a special\nbulletin from Metric News. (jaunty big band music) As America moves toward the metric system, the last holdouts have been\nseen finally switching over. Soon, it is predicted, the\nwhole world will be unified under this easier system of measurement."

There are over 8 million new young voters eligible for this\nmidterm that's coming up, and most of them will not vote\njust like based on the data. So please prove the data wrong. Make a plan to vote if you don't have one. Most states have like early voting. It's actually very doable, and it feels really good. Like it feels really good to vote and know that you're actually\nlike fighting for change. Climate Power isn't selling you anything. Literally, it is there\nto make it super easy to register to vote, to\nfind your polling places, to learn how to vote\nearly if you wanna do that so you don't have to\ngo to a polling place. In short, it makes it easier for you to have your voice heard as a young person who probably won't vote. There are a lot of candidates running who don't care about climate change, who don't think it's a real problem and that's why this is important. It is so important that Climate Power is\nsponsoring today's video and I am so on board with that. So thank you Climate Power for sponsoring this video\nand supporting my channel. But seriously, the passage of\nthe Inflation Reduction Act is the beginning. We have momentum, let's keep it up. So go to votefuture.org to\nquickly register to vote and to find out what you can do to really affect this election. And check the links in my description that bring you to Climate Power where you can learn more\nabout what you can do to actually have your voice heard. Okay, let's get back to another\nvery important global issue, the war in Ukraine. (jet engine roaring) (missile explosion) (people speaking in foreign language) - Okay, quick reminder that this invasion that happened in February\nwas really just an escalation of a war that's been going on over here in the eastern part of\nUkraine for eight years. - [Presenter] The Russian military now being directly involved in fighting Ukrainian government forces. - [Presenter] Russian troops spreading out throughout the strategic\nCrimean peninsula. (Putin speaking in foreign language) - It was back in 2014 that Putin invaded and occupied and then annexed, which basically just\nmeans stole this peninsula called Crimea. That sparked a war that has\nbeen going on in this region, the Donbass region for eight years, where Ukrainians who\nsympathized with Russia, rose up trying to fight to\nbecome a part of Russia. (Putin speaking Russian) - And then, as we all\nknow, earlier this year, I mean, you know what happened. (ominous music) Putin moved in from all sides, except for the West, of course. His big goal was to swiftly\ntake the capital of Kyiv. You gotta take the capital if\nyou want to win a war quickly. The scariest images at the beginning of the\nwar if you remember, were these 60 kilometer long convoys of Russian military\nvehicles in these huge lines moving towards the capital. 60 kilometers long. I mean, these images were so striking. I frankly thought Putin was\ngonna be victorious in this. I thought he was going\nto take the capital. But this plan very much did not work. - We are seeing Russians\nslowly getting closer to Kyiv. - [Presenter] Ukrainian forces are continuing to hold their\ncapital from the Russians. - This was Putin's first\nbig miscalculation. He way overestimated his troops' ability and way underestimated\nthe response of Ukrainians and the West who pumped loads\nof weapons into the country to help them fight. Not only did the Russian\narmy fail to take Kyiv, the Ukrainian army\nmounted a very effective counter offensive and pushed Russia out of all of this territory in the course of just a few weeks. After this giant defeat, Putin calls all of his\ntroops back to regroup and to focus on a more\nnarrow front of the war. Sticking to over here, the plan was now to continue to liberate the eastern regions of the country that already had a lot of\npro Russian separatists, who again, had been fighting\nhere for eight years. And as the summer approached, I think this is where a lot\nof us like started to tune out because the war turned into\na long protracted stalemate, with some occasional Russian gains and a few counter offensive\nfrom the Ukrainians. The term we need to use\nhere is war of attrition. Basically, who can wear\ndown the other first through destruction and endurance. This is a horrible way to fight a war. And while Putin's attempt\nto take over Kyiv failed, He didn't fail in taking over other major population centers. Like here in Kherson, which was the first major\ncity to fall to Russia after the invasion. - The battle for Kherson in\nparticular is intensifying. - Watching how they treat\ntheir first conquered city is a really good indicator of what Russia's real goal is here. They didn't just occupy the city, they got busy turning it into Russia. They took down the Ukrainian flag and replaced it with a Russian one. They put up these creepy\nbillboards with like young children about Russia being one people, and Russia is quote, \"here forever,\" like super on the nose on\nwhat they're trying to do. The brave people of Kherson\ngathered and protested like right next to Russian tanks, but they didn't stop\nthe Russians from doing what they clearly had been\nplanning this whole time. On May 1st, Russia\nannounced that these people would start using the Russian ruble, like the Russian currency. They seized control of the broadcasting and internet channels and stopped these people from being able to connect with the world. These events are a big deal because Putin said he was\ninvading to liberate these people, a special military operation,\nnot to conquer them. Putin was unable to oust the government and initiate a regime change to put in a government that would've been more\nfriendly to Russia. So now it looks like he's gonna\ntry to gobble up the country from the east piece by piece. And the keyword here is annex. (missile launching) - Russia has launched an\nintense ground campaign to capture a key Ukrainian city in the Eastern Donbass region. - Annex is a super benign\nlike technical word, but it means to conquer\nland to then occupy it, and then to just unilaterally declare that this land is a part\nof our sovereign territory. No treaties, no nothing, just a unilateral land grab. So let's rewind to the\nbeginning of the war. Watch how at the beginning it\nwas all about this invasion from all three sides, a\nvery aggressive invasion, again with the focus on the capital. But once Russia got kicked out of Kyiv, the war really starts to\nbecome focused on all of this. But Russia made progress. They took over all of\nthese population centers here in the Donbass region, and by the end of April, it was starting to become\nclear what the next move was. It came out in Russian\nmedia in this report that a senior Russian military official said that the next phase\nof the operation was quote, \"To establish full\ncontrol over the Donbass and Southern Ukraine regions. And then he says it point blank, he says that this will allow Russia to establish a land bridge\nfrom mainland Russia all the way to Crimea, this peninsula that\nRussia annexed in 2014. But why stop there? This Russian military\ncommander then infers that the next part of the plan is to create that land bridge even further all the way to Transnistria, this little sliver of a pretend country that basically no one recognizes and that should be a part of Moldova, but that is full of Russian soldiers and a bunch of people who\nwant Russia to annex them. Establishing this part of the land bridge would be pretty difficult, because it would mean a battle in Odesa, which is Ukraine's third largest city. There'd be a horrible fight, so let's just hope that part of the plan does not come to fruition. But Russia has been successful in deeply establishing this land bridge between their country and Crimea, but to do that, they had to\nfight a very bloody battle in the port city of Mariupol. - [Presenter] We begin tonight\nwith the battle for Mariupol. - [Presenter] The mayor of Mariupol is calling on residents to evacuate. - After an egregious few weeks, Russia finally took over the city. - [Presenter] Thousands of\ncivilians remain in Mariupol. - So yeah, that's the phase of the war that we are in right now. More and more evidence is mounting that Russia isn't just planning to occupy and liberate these people, but to actually annex them\nto be a part of Russia. US intelligence reports claim that Russia is installing\nRussian officials to lead these cities and regions. They're creating these fast\ntracks for Russian citizenship and making it so that all new\nbabies born in these regions are automatically Russian citizens. Any day now they're\ngonna hold fake elections to gauge if the people want to be Russian. And when you look at the results, you're gonna see that somehow a ridiculously giant\nnumber of people voted yes. This is their annexation playbook. They've done it before and it's worked, and it looks like they're doing it again. - Annexation by force\nwould be a gross violation of the UN charter and we will not allow it to\ngo unchallenged or unpunished. - But the Ukrainians are fighting back. They have not surrendered to this army that is way more powerful than they are. As we're making this video, there is a giant counter\noffensive happening up here, and the Ukrainian army is\ntaking back huge swaths of land. The New York Times pointed out that Ukraine captured\nmore territory in a week than Russia had captured in five months. If you watch the videos\nof the Ukrainian soldiers liberating these cities,\nit's pretty emotional. And if we're looking at the\nmap thinking strategically, it's an important reminder\nof what the spokesperson of the US National Security Council said. - And we would remind Mr. Putin that over time may prove\nunable to hold this territory. - And this gets to the last\npoint I want to make here. I'm here to argue that he's already lost. Back at the beginning of this\nwar I made this prediction thinking that Putin\nwas gonna be successful in taking the capital and\noverthrowing the government. All logic pointed that he\nwas capable of doing that, but he clearly did not. I was wrong. Instead, Putin has been able\nto control a few strips of land in the east and the south. He's got his landbridge to\nCrimea and he may keep going, but again, Putin's war,\nthe motive and the goal is based on some pretty giant delusions, chief among them that he\nis liberating these people who are ready to come\nback to the Russian flock. That is not what is happening and we have seven months\nworth of war to prove it. (upbeat music)"

    "captions": "- A legacy in Silicon Valley. - Palo Alto's kind of this mythical place. - Humans have always searched\nfor mythical, magical places. Atlantis, El Dorado, Shangri-La, but none of them have actually\nbeen found besides one. It started on a typical workday for me when I was sifting through maps which, yes, is something\nI routinely just do. Oh my God. Paper maps, digitized maps, animated maps. I just can't get enough. So I'm sitting there\nlooking through some maps and I stumble upon this. This is a super old British\nmap of North America with a giant island off the West Coast. The island is labeled California. Okay, so clearly some cartographer just got this totally wrong\nand made a mistake, right? But wait, here's another\nand another and another. (mid tempo rhythmic music) What is going on here? This one's from 1785 or from 1750. This one's from 1690 and from 1650. Like, these maps of\nCalifornia as an island are spanning over 200 years. Drawn by the Dutch and the Germans and the British and the Japanese, everyone is making a map\nshowing California as an island. Is this like a tectonic plates thing? Like, was California an island? Because as we dug, we found\nthousands of these maps. California as an island everywhere. I had to get to the bottom of this to figure out what was going on here. Luckily, I live in Washington DC so there's somewhere I need to\ngo visit to figure this out. (uptempo string music) - [Train Announcer] This is\nMetro Center transfer point. - Hey, in case anyone is in DC and is looking for a nuclear\nfallout shelter, I found one. The Library of Congress. (suspenseful string music) - [Library Worker] Hi there. - [Johnny] That's also my\nbackground as well, that map. - Really?\n- Yeah, yes. I love it, it's just so beautiful. Look at this puppy. Wow. Wow. Oh my God. So wait, this is really weird. I'm looking at these original maps, 1600s. California is an island. But then look at this one. This is a map from like\na few decades earlier and it shows California\naccurately mapped earlier, like, decades earlier in like the 1500s. They had it right and it looks pretty\naccurate to the California we know today. And then, suddenly, the whole world started mapping California as an island. What? This is super weird. (mid tempo techno music) I vow now to figure out what the hell\nis going on with California. (uplifting music) This first started as a nerdy\nhistory cartography question but soon we fell into a way deeper story than we signed up for. The story of a mythical\nplace called California, full of gold and magic and dreams, fueled by people who weren't\ntotally grounded in reality but rather in dreams of something bigger, something different, something that may or may not truly exist. This island teaches us something bigger than just how humans draw maps, it's actually more about how\nhumans want to see the world, about how fake ideas spread and why. So let me show you how,\nfor hundreds of years, California was an island\nand how it still kind of is. (upbeat music) Hey, wake up for a second. Do you mind if I chat\nwith you about something? - I guess. - I make YouTube videos and, in order to do that, I have a business that\nallows me to do that and the business is from sponsorships. And so I'm making a video today that's sponsored by a\ncompany called Storyblocks, which is a company I've used for like a decade, even before\nthey came to sponsor a video. Storyblocks is like a massive library of visual and audio assets that you can use to\nmake your videos better. So creators of all size,\nsmall, medium, large, giant creative teams, can subscribe to Storyblocks at whatever budget or\nprice point they need and can have an unlimited library of like 4K amazing stock footage that is diverse, that is ever-growing. There's like thousands\nand thousands of clips. I use this all the time for my videos. One of the big challenges for creators is that it's really hard\nto go out into the field and shoot stuff and so when you're making a video, you don't have have a lot of\nlike really good visual assets. With Storyblocks you\nliterally have a subscription to an unlimited amount of\namazing visuals and sound effects and animation templates. It's a really freaking good deal. In the video I'm making right now it's about maps of California and why California used to be an island. You're gonna see like tons\nof Storyblocks footage that you won't even know\nis Storyblocks footage but it is, because I use it all the time. So, anyway, thank you Storyblocks\nfor supporting this video. Thank you for listening. There's a link in my description. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel but it also sends you to Storyblocks so you can check out their pricing plan, find something that fits your budget. So now I'm headed back to the studio to figure out what the hell\nis going on with California being mapped as an island. One, two, three, four, five. Okay, this is California and this is Baja, California,\nwhich is a part of Mexico. And this is the Sea of Cortez. It's not a full-blown sea, it's actually a gulf,\nthe Gulf of California. But we call it the Sea of Cortez and you're about to find out why. I actually went here once when I was a 19 year-old Mormon missionary living in Baja, California for two years. Anyway, that is not important. Let's talk about how\nthis became an island. California originally was an idea, a myth. It was a fictional setting\nwritten into this novel from 1510 in Spain, like, 500 years ago. California was like Atlantis\nor the Garden of Eden. The author described it as an island populated by black women, without any men existing there. On the entire island there was no metal other than gold and it was ruled by Queen\nCalafia, hence California. Again, it was a fake place, this is not a real place. This is a guy writing a\nnovel about a fake place. But while the author doesn't\nsay exactly where this is, he basically says that it is, quote, \"at the right hand of the Indies.\" Reminder that the Indies is like over here in Southeast Asia. This novel was published in Spain about 50 years after the\ninvention of the printing press. So printed books were like a\nnew technology, a big thing, and this book was really popular. Oh, and by the way, the book also mentions that\nthe women in California these like women warriors, were, quote, \"of beautiful\nand robust bodies.\" So you have new technology, books, and beautifully robust women, basically clickbait for\nSpanish sailors in the 1500s. They were out there exploring the world and reading this book\nwhile they were out to sea. Oh, and remember, at this time, these Spanish sailors are\nout exploring the world that Columbus had run into when he was trying to find a\nquicker way to get to Asia. So it's like 10 years after Columbus and Spain is sending people\nto explore the new world and by explore we mean wink\nwink, extract resources and like destroy the\npopulation and make Spain rich. And one of those expeditions\nhad this guy on board, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. He came over as a young dude but he quickly became one of\nthe most shrewd, aggressive, like detail-oriented\ncolonizers that Spain had. He goes on a big expedition where he takes his 500 men and 16 horses to go look for gold. But Cort\u00e9s was secretly\nharboring another goal for this expedition, he was reading the romance novel that everyone else was reading and he kind of wanted to find California, the fictional place in the book. This would be like some\nguy being out in like Nepal on a hike or something and he's like, I secretly\nwanna find Middle Earth. This kind of reminds me of\nwhen I was in Wales in 2011 and I like secretly\nwanted to find Hogwarts. Like that kind of actually happened, I was young. And I was like, what if\nI stumble upon Hogwarts? Like, I get it Cort\u00e9s, I get it. You read it in the book and you're like this\nplace is probably real. Cort\u00e9s, a legitimate Spanish Explorer, is now looking for a fake place in a book. So Cort\u00e9s, after he stumbles\nupon a great civilization, allies with their\nenemies and destroys them with his guns and his smallpox, small side note that can be\ncovered in a different time. He eventually makes it over here. Oh, by the way, Cort\u00e9s was kind of going\nrogue this whole time, he didn't have permission to do this. And the Spanish leadership\nwere kind of freaking out. So much so that Cort\u00e9s had\nto write a bunch of letters justifying how good all\nof this conquest was. Anyway, Cort\u00e9s sends out a mission to go explore a little\nfurther off this coast, like around here. Holy shit, they found something! Cort\u00e9s is so giddy\nabout this new discovery that he writes a letter back to the king saying that his men\ntalked to some natives. (speaking in foreign language) who, quote, \"affirm\nthat there is an island (speaking in foreign language) inhabited only by women. And there are no men, that men come every once in a while for them to like conceive but they only keep the female children. (speaking in foreign language) It's only 10 days away (speaking in foreign language) and that this island is\nvery rich in pearls, perlas, and gold, y oro.\" What? Holy shit. No men, only women, rich in gold. (mid tempo music) And where does Cort\u00e9s\nthink he is right now? Well, back when the world looked like this in these people's minds, Cort\u00e9s is just to the right of the Indies, which is exactly the location\ndescribed in the book for California. Cort\u00e9s just discovered California. Oh man, this is amazing. I can feel the excitement of Cort\u00e9s who literally has spent years\nthinking about this island and now he thinks he's\nfound it, California. But this is not what the\nking of Spain signed up for. So the king of Spain's like, no, dude, no, we're not looking for\nlike mythical islands. So he cuts off all of the funding for any of these like expeditions. So Cort\u00e9s turns to his own personal wealth and starts funding these\nexpeditions on his own, to go map out and find\nCalifornia, the island. - Now I have to go to California. - He personally goes on a voyage and starts mapping and mapping, and, lo and behold, he's finding what looks like an island. And they set up a colony\nright here on this island and they name the island California, after the island of Queen\nCalafia from the book. (joyful music) Okay, okay, okay. Spoiler alert. Remember that Cort\u00e9s is like right here. He's looking up this massive gulf that he thinks is like a full-blown sea that you can like circumnavigate, but he's just like at the\nbottom of Baja, California, the peninsula. And, worst of all, he's\nburning his own cash to keep exploring this\nCalifornia island idea. He's got California fever. Maybe the first but definitely not the last to have it. - We're going to California. - So Cort\u00e9s keeps going and\nhe's feeling really excited. He's like, if this is an island then that means that this\nsea probably extends up and over the top of North America. And maybe there's a whole strait that goes all the way back to Spain, making it super easy for us\nto get between Spain and Asia. And so he keeps mapping\nand mapping and mapping and oh no, womp womp, Cort\u00e9s ruined the myth for everyone, and he like wasted away a bunch\nof his money in the process. But wait a minute, this is like still the\nbeginning of the story. Like, you see how much\nlonger is left in this video. Like, this isn't the story. What's crazy is what happens next. Because even though Cort\u00e9s found out that California wasn't an island, this was all before this happened. And this is where the\nstory gets very juicy. I am H-O. Because somehow, even after all of this, California still somehow managed\nto make the world believe that it was an island\nfor hundreds of years. Okay, so after the whole Cort\u00e9s California dreaming incident, Spain went on to ignore mapping California for a very long time. I mean, they were really busy conquering and destroying and pillaging a lot of other places in the region. That is until the late 1500s, where they catch wind of a British sailor who happens to be their\nliteral sworn enemy, who apparently just landed here in what was gonna become Oregon to claim all of this land for Britain. And Spain was like, oh shit, we gotta get back in the\ngame up there in that place, what was it called again? Cort\u00e9s called it like California after like from the novel or something. Anyway, let's get some guys back up there to like map it out. We can't be asleep at the wheel while the British are showing up on the West Coast of North America. So they send out this expedition of guys to go map the West Coast of California. Because, after all, if\nyou can map something you can conquer it. That's all they were thinking\nabout here was Britain. Okay, and this is where things get so good all because of another California dreamer. This guy, Fray Antonio de la Ascensi\u00f3n, a Spanish dude who wasn't\nreally a sailor or an explorer or a cartographer, he was kind of like a Catholic priest. Aboard this expedition\nthere were legit map makers and Fray Antonio was\nliterally the assistant. He had some knowledge of map-making but like he was literally the plan B in case the main map maker died. His job was really just to be religious. Boy, did he do a lot more than that. Fray Antonio, the peon assistant, is actually the most important person in this entire story, because he had an agenda. He really wanted Spain to\nsettle more aggressively in California. He felt the pull of California, this mythical cool place on the West Coast and it was his life's\nmission to sell the idea of Spain coming to California and setting up more permanent settlements. No one on board this expedition\nwas on the same page, they were there just simply\nmapping the West Coast, that's all they were doing. So they're going along this route, Fray Antonio is on the\nship probably really bored, 'cause he's literally not doing anything. He's looking overboard at this land sort of in the distance, and he starts to see\neverything through his lens of total bias. This bias that California was amazing and that Spain should settle it. So they're passing like right here on their way to the West Coast and Fray Antonio writes, quote, \"Here begins the entrance\nof the sea of California which continues all the way\nup north into this strait that actually goes above North America. And that, if you go, you can find passage and navigation to Spain.\" Wait, what? Antonio, you're sitting on\nthe side of a boat right here looking at basically this. And from that you've deduced\nthat California is an island and that there's a passage\nabove North America that goes back to Spain? I swear California does this to people. It makes them ignore reality\nin the name of a big dream. - Yet the thought of\ngiving up everything here and starting fresh in California, it's so tempting and exhilarating. - That is a theme here. It happened to Cort\u00e9s, it's\nhappening to Fray Antonio. The guys on the ship are\nlike, \"Dude, listen, Antonio we get it, you want Spain to settle in California but that's not what this mission is about. We're here to map the West\nCoast of North America, so just like chill out and do your job. Sit around and be religious.\" And Fray Antonio, like,\ncontinues to wax super nostalgic. He's like \"San Diego is a very fine bay, very fine anchorage, protected from all the\nwinds and undertow.\" Anyway, this expedition goes on to fulfill its original purpose, they mapped the West Coast of California and they create this decent looking map. But Fray Antonio walked\naway from this mission with a very different view. He was convinced that\nCalifornia was an island and that there was a\nmythical northern passage that existed all the way back to Spain. And he was so audacious to say, quote, \"I believe it will be\nnecessary and important to use\" what he's created, what he saw, \"for revising and correcting\nthe existing maps of the Earth\" since the existing maps\nbasically are very different than what they are, in fact. Translation, Spain, you\nneed to change your maps to what I saw when I\nwas sitting there bored looking over the boat, because California is an island. I mean, the confidence in\nthis guy is astounding. Fray Antonio, like, makes\na big ruckus about this. He tries to get Spain to change their maps to make California an island. It got to the point where the\nofficial map maker of Spain had to actually say, dude, you're wrong. He said, quote, \"Since no\nproof of the lake of gold or Strait of Ani\u00e1n\", which is that northern strait, \"exists, and since California has\nnot been circumnavigated, little credit should be\ngiven to these concepts.\" Like dude, Fray Antonio, you're fake news, you've been debunked, give it up. But Fray Antonio does not give it up. For the next two decades, he continues to pitch his\nfake version of California. Sending loads of reports and maps of his version of California, what he saw, all with the hope that\nSpain would catch on and come settle California. And he started to actually\ngain some followers. He was pitching this, he\nwas like on a campaign to like spread this idea\nthat California is an island, I saw it with my own eyes. And this is where it gets crazy because guess who enters\nthe story, but pirates. Early 1600s is like the\ngolden age for pirates. Thousands of pirates were sailing the seas and because Spain was like\nthe best at stealing stuff and conquering places, a Spanish ship was always\nlike jackpot for the pirates. One such Spanish ship was sailing back from\nthe new world to Spain and onboard this ship was\none of Fray Antonio's letters with a copy of his fake map that showed California as an island. And the ship was taken\nover by Dutch pirates. They took the ship, they\nsteal all the stuff, and they stumble upon this\nBS fake map from Fray Antonio like a deepfake of the\nmap of North America. And the pirates are\nlike, whoa, look at this. The Spanish have California as an island. Little context here, maps back then were kind\nof a national secret, they didn't share maps very much. So these Dutch guys are like holy shit, we just discovered a big Spanish secret that California is an island and that there's actually a strait that goes over the top of North America. And they've been keeping\nit from us the whole time. So this map from Fray Antonio\ngets back to the Netherlands which, at the time, were rising as like really\ngood map makers and sailors. And boom. A few years later, the fake\nnews just got retweeted. Here it is, this little map on the cover\npage of some Dutch Atlas. You see, for the first time, California not connected to the mainland. But wait, Cort\u00e9s already mapped this and showed that this wasn't\nan island like 100 years ago. No, what is happening? The answer is Fray Antonio and pirates. The myth was back. Shortly after that, another map pops up. The Dutch are slowly adopting the idea of California as an island and, in true fake news form, everyone else was like, well\nthe Dutch they're legit, they said that California is an island, so I guess it is. Word eventually spread to London, where a famous map maker made this map. Wait a minute, I know this map. This is the one that\noriginally got me interested in this whole entire topic. Whoa, hold on. And now I finally understand what it says in this lower left. \"California, sometimes supposed to be a part of the Western continent but since by a Spanish\nchart taken by Hollanders, it is found to be a goodly island.\" British cartographer, verified account, retweets Fray Antonio's delusion and suddenly this map with\nCalifornia as an island is legitimized and starts\nto spread like wildfire. \"Seems legit\" says a Dutch cartographer, boom, retweet. Then to Germany, then to\nFrance, then to Italy, then to Sweden and Turkey is now drawing\nCalifornia as an island and Austria is drawing\nCalifornia as an island. And now Japan is drawing\nCalifornia as an island. Retweet, retweet, retweet. Oof, man, where are the mods on this one? Who's gonna fact check this? The entire globe now thinks\nthat California is an island. And so, yeah, this is how it happened. Lots of wishful thinking, a few crazy coincidences with pirates. The whole world thinks\nCalifornia's an island for 200 years, 200 years, that's like several lifetimes. All because this one guy was\nobsessed with a fake vision and he wouldn't let it go. Now, of course, eventually explorers would\ngo and fact check this and debunk it, and maps, slowly but surely, start to phase out\nCalifornia as an island. But I wanna argue that this\nwasn't just Fray Antonio and his wishful thinking, I kind of think that\nCalifornia does this to people. Starting with Cort\u00e9s and\ncontinuing to this day, California has continued to\nhave a mythical pull on people, at least it has on European people coming to California looking\nfor something magical, looking for gold, eventually actually finding gold. Like, which is kind of insane to me that the prophecy from a\n1510 novel written in Spain kind of came true in 1849, when a bunch of people\nfound gold in California. As the local people who had been in California\nfor thousands of years were exterminated and replaced\nby industrious Europeans, California remained and\ncontinues to be a place where people go to dream big. - Palo Alto's kind of this mythical place where, you know, all\nthe startups come from. - [Johnny] Like Cort\u00e9s, who spent all of his money\ntrying to like figure out what California was or Fray Antonio, who spent\na good part of his life trying to convince people\nthat California was an island, something special and, ultimately, it worked. People go to California to chase dreams that usually aren't grounded in any sense of reality. - You've been on the cover of magazines, you could transform healthcare not only here in America,\nbut around the world. - They go and they push\nand they push and they push on some vision of something new, even when those dreams rest\non spreading disinformation to the whole world. Was that too on the nose? Am I stretching the analogy too much with disinformation and propaganda and Fray Antonio and Silicon Valley? Like, are you getting this? I'll stop. The point is that, to me, this\nis the beauty and the peril of California as a place. Yeah, it's attached to the continent, we all know that but California kind of is an island. Ecologically, it has thousands\nof totally unique species of flora and fauna that don't exist anywhere else. Economically, it's the fifth\nbiggest economy on Earth. And culturally, I mean,\nCalifornia is its own culture. And the result is that, today, people still do what those guys were doing in the 15/1600s, coming west to California to chase dreams, to chase gold, to chase something new. In that sense, California is an island, Fray Antonio was right the whole time. Okay, see ya. (uplifting techno music)"

    "title": "How SUBWAY is Taking Over Korea",
    "video_id": "EhlPFoL70lE",
    "captions": "(voice over loudspeaker) - Next to the product placement that Subway engages in overseas. Particularly in Korean dramas where every plot point\nseems to occur at a Subway. Here is two characters having a meeting at one. Here is a group of men\ncelebrating the fact their friend's just woke up from a coma. - I'm going to South Korea, let's look into this. - [John] Subway's done\na significant amount of product placement. I'm talking of course about\nKorean sandwich dramas. - Subway in South Korea. I did not come to Seoul, South Korea to talk about Subway sandwiches. I am here for a different story, one that really focuses on this city that is 40 kilometers from the border with North Korea. But I was in the Istanbul airport on a layover on my way to South Korea and I watched that John Oliver clip and started to go down a rabbit hole. (upbeat music) Subway shows up a lot in Korean dramas. Not just like one or two, but like five, 10, 15,\nalmost 20 different shows have product placement\nfrom Subway sandwiches. The American fast food chain that is apparently the largest fast food chain in the\nworld by store locations. What? What is going on here? Subway is not cool, it is not good, and yet K-dramas are full of Subway. We gotta get to the bottom of this. Is there something special\nabout Korean Subway? Like is it different? Am I missing something? Is there something better\nabout Korean Subway versus American Subway? Because if there is I\nwant to know about it. So first, let's settle that. I'll do mozzarella, hot chili, salt and pepper. Okay, after that very scientific study which by the way was a\nlittle bit scientific because I did choose the specialty items that only exist in Korea\nand not in America, and I chose something that had beef in it which is a thing that\nKorea does really well. So I tried to give South Korea the best chance of being differentiated, and the result is that it\nis kind of better, kind of. - Eat fresh. Eat fresh. - Eat fresh. - That's my man. - But not really. It's like still just microwaves and like mass produced\nindustrial ingredients prepared in front of you. They kind of taste old and stale, kind of delicious at the same time. I don't know. But the thing I noticed at this location and several others that I've visited in my short time here in Seoul is that these subways\nlook and feel different. Cleaner, more sleek, well lit. So yeah, I guess you could say that Subway sandwiches taste better when you're eating them here instead of here. Okay, this is not what\nthis video is about. It's not about whether or not Korean Subway is better\nthan American Subway, you can decide that. I'm interested in how Subway sandwiches has taken over Korean dramas. There is an explanation for this. I talked to an expert in this topic who's like the guy to explain it. He's a communications and media professor at one of the best universities in Korea, and he has thoughts on this. But first, I have to do the thing that allows me to make these videos which is tell you about the\nsponsor of today's video. So let's go back to Washington\nDC for a few moments and thank today's sponsor. Here we are back in Washington DC doing an ad read. But unlike Subway in K-dramas, I am actually putting a break between the video and this ad read. That's the difference, all\nmedia has to make money somehow, I just am doing it by putting a wall between\nthe story and the ad. So thank you NordVPN for\nsponsoring today's video. A VPN is a tool that I use pretty often, especially lately as I've been traveling. Being in Korea, my\ncomputer's been freaking out as I try to log into things. And so to solve that, I log onto NordVPN and I\nconnect to the internet via the United States. And this isn't some\nlike coding nerd thing, this is like press one button and you're now connected\nvia the United States, and now I can log onto Gmail, and Gmail is just fine with it and no one freaks out, and we're good. A VPN also allows you to watch stuff that like isn't maybe\navailable in your country, but you just connect via the UK and suddenly you're\nwatching like Netflix UK. It's pretty cool. NordVPN is also expanding to become a threat protection tool. It's a tool that allows you to block malicious trackers, malware, and when you're like sitting\non public wifi in a cafe, and you're not super secure, it totally gives you a buffer of security that to me gives me a\nlittle peace of mind. And right now they're having a 30 day money back guarantee if you sign up. So really, you have nothing to lose. You can try this out and see if it works. There is a link in my description, it's NordVPN.com/JohnnyHarris. When you click that link it\nhelps support this channel so go do us both a favor, click the link, and you also will get\nin on an exclusive deal. Four months of free NordVPN to try it out for four months. Thank you NordVPN for\nsupporting this channel, back to Korea to figure\nout what's going on with K-drama and Subway. You know, maybe I should have done that ad as a product placement. No, I wouldn't do that, you probably would be very angry if I did, like slipped it into this video. - Subway cannot stand for that, and frankly Rick, I'm surprised you did. - Instead, there was an ad break, there was a little commercial, and now we're back to the show. That is a very normal model for a lot of media around the world, but not in Korea. Turns out that South Korea has a very different culture\nsurrounding advertising and media. And by very different I mean they haven't ever allowed\nthere to be commercial breaks. No commercials. You're watching a TV\nshow on the television, which most of you don't do anymore, but like forever that's the way it's been and then there's a commercial break. Like that's a very normal thing, we're all very used to it. In South Korea that has not been allowed. It's been against the law, it's been completely regulated against. (speaking in Korean) In Korea they're obsessed with this idea of viewership rights. It's a very aggressive set of regulations that don't let advertisers\nput commercials in shows. Spoiler alert, that's slightly changing. But for years, that has\nalways been the case. (speaking in Korean) Okay, but then a few\nthings start to happen. These broadcasters, these TV channels really started to struggle because people were moving away from TV. And this really threatened\nthe shows that were being made because now they wouldn't have a budget. Korean dramas were\nstarting to see popularity and get viewers all over the world. The Korean government saw an opportunity to change their advertising rules to let advertisers put\nKorean goods and products into the shows. To advertise, but like\nas a part of the story, not like in a commercial that's like in the middle of the show, but like to bake in a product to the story which is called product placement. So in 2010, they started\nto ease these restrictions, and people go nuts. And it got really cringey really fast. (speaking in Korean) (yelling) Yeah, it was pretty bad. Every product placement is a gamble. If you make it too\nobvious, too on the nose then it can actually create a negative association with your brand, and there's backlash. But what it did was it put more money into these shows, bigger budgets, and the shows got better and better and the audiences around the world grew, and the product placement got\nmore and more sophisticated. - It's just an interesting\nsystem in Korea, where rather than drama companies approaching advertisers, it's advertisers who\napproach drama companies. - I mean there's a lot of money in this. (speaking in Korean) Do a couple of those, and you're making some pretty good cash to make your show better. At first it was Korean and Chinese brands, which got a lot of scrutiny, people kind of hated it. (speaking in Korean) And then a few years ago, Subway the sandwich maker decided that they wanted in on this. (speaking in Korean) (upbeat music) One thing I love about this city so far is that there are just\nlittle nooks and crannies. I'm in the middle of the city, and there's this little\npeaceful like garden space. Look at this, this is like right in front of Starbucks. Subway's strategy was very bold. They decided they wanted\nto own this space. They poured tons and tons of money into product placement into K-dramas, as well as increasing\ncelebrity endorsements which is another thing that has a lot of marketing power in South Korea. They started to go nuts. They're like it's time\nfor a brand refresh. Yeah we know we're getting a lot of flack for our tuna and our bread and all of this in other countries, but here in South Korea,\nit's a clean slate. We're gonna establish\na new brand perception through K-dramas and celebrities. And that is exactly what they did. (speaking in Korean) The thing about Subway\nthat makes sense here is that like Subway is a product, but it's also a place. And every show needs a set, it needs a place for things to happen. It could be a nameless cafe,\nor a random restaurant, or it could be a Subway sandwiches. And especially because\nthe regulation made it so that you couldn't have the actors overtly be like you should buy Subway. You can like show the space,\nyou can show the brand, you can show them like eating it, but you can't have them like overtly tell people to buy things which is just fine for Subway. Because now they can integrate their store and their food into these stories. - Excessive number of visits to locations like Subway\ncan be quite jarring. At a certain point they can ruin the mood or they can become comical because nobody actually wants\nto eat at Subway that often. - Sometimes it's just a matter of like people sitting around\nhaving a conversation while they have like beautifully\npackaged Subway sandwiches having the logo faced towards the camera. But with time it started to become more and more intertwined\nwith the actually storyline. Like this show about a ghost who can't eat anything\nbecause he's a ghost, but then this man hands\nhim a subway sandwich and suddenly he can eat, and he's really happy and excited because he was so hungry. I'm not sure how that makes sense in the context of the story, or like the rules of\nthis like ghost world, but it made sense for Subway's bottom line and the budget of this production. - And the Emmy goes to Subway. (applause) - Some of these are so on the nose where like the plot point itself is about how delicious the sandwich looks. Like look at her just like\nstaring at that sandwich and she's just like I want that and suddenly I'm looking at this and I'm like I want it too. Like maybe I need to go back to Subway and get another sandwich. Here's a man who's dying, they're trying to revive\nhim with a defibrillator, and he goes into a dream state. He's on the fringe of death and like his last memory is like remembering this date he went on to a Subway sandwiches. He feeds her the sandwich\nand the soft drink all with the logo perfectly\nplaced to face the camera, I mean it's so good. Oh and guess what, it's\nabsolutely working. One Subway executive here in Korea told the New York Times\nthat it is night and day the difference between\nthe before and the after of product placement. Oh and it's not just for swooning Koreans into loving Subway. Remember how K-dramas are becoming really popular in the United States? Showing these slick subway shops and delicious looking sandwiches to an American audience via Korean dramas, which are exploding in the states, is this bizarre round\ntrip of brand awareness, and to be honest, it's kind of brilliant. Like it's, I don't know, I've only been thinking about this for like 36 hours, but like it's kind of working on me too. Like I'm having some renewed interest in like wait, is Subway cool? - Subway I love you. - It's a very different thing than the association I have, and that's what branding is, it's this mental tug of war. (speaking in Korean) This is just like branding 101, and Subway is doing a damn good job at it through Korean dramas. Oh, and it's not just\nSubway that's classier, Dunkin Donuts is also\nsuper nice in South Korea. I've never seen a Dunkin Donuts that looks anything other\nthan a dingy, gross place, but the Dunkin Donuts\nhere looks really nice. I'm gonna go get a donut. (speaking in Korean) It's been really fascinating for me to see all of these American\nbrands here in South Korea who have been able to like start afresh in this new market. To basically build the brand that they wish they would have back in the United States. (speaking in Korean) So yeah it's working for Subway, but they've also pushed\nit a little bit too far. There are moments in\nsome of these K-dramas where a guy just like gives\nsomeone else a Subway sandwich. It has nothing to do with the story. It's like okay. - Product placement\nfor brand new products, especially high tech products that Koreans aren't using yet. Like characters who in the drama might not actually have the finances to invest in that kind of gadget. Those are particularly\nannoying to me personally. When you have these lines about how much a\ncharacter loves the coffee or wants the coffee, it's like this is instant coffee people, it's not that amazing. - Overall, Subway has come out on top. They've been able to walk the line kind of balancing between\novert product placement that gives them a lot of screen time while also trying to\nmake it somewhat natural, like not too forced and cringey and like off the plot. And they're getting\nbetter and better at this, at like integrating it into the story so that it's not so awkward. And perhaps most brilliantly they've done a good job at like kind of making fun of themselves for like this sort of trope\nof over product placement. In this little web series\nthey did on YouTube which is like a little drama, but it was produced by\nSubway all about Subway. Like the entire plot\ntakes place in a Subway about a Subway employee, and there's like a love\nstory with this girl, and it has to do with like\nthe plant based sandwich and like the steak and cheese sandwich. John Oliver kind of made this sound like this was a really serious thing, but this was totally\ntongue in cheek satire. Subway knows that this trope\nis like kind of ridiculous and they're poking fun at themselves. Showing some self-awareness that like definitely disarms any critics. But then also, people have told me that this show is actually\nlike kind of good. Like they can see themselves watching all of the episodes. It has millions of views. Like this is funny satire mixed with like real storytelling, and Subway is at the center of it, like come on. Who is doing this? Who is in charge of this? They're doing a great job. Congratulations marketing people who are in charge of this, it's working. (speaking in Korean) So product placement in K-dramas is only gonna get more sophisticated, more a part of the story,\nand more ubiquitous. (speaking in Korean) It's such a strange interesting cycle, but it's happening, there's no going back. I did not come to South Korea to talk about Subway sandwiches. Alas I am here for a different story that I have been reporting on while here up at the border with North Korea learning a lot about the realities of the situation here\nin the Korean Peninsula. Spoiler alert, it's quite a bit different than what we hear on the news in the west, so stay tuned for that. Watch yourself some K-dramas, get yourself some Subway and you will officially\nbe on the front lines of this weird disruptive strange time of globalized media and\nadvertising and food. What is happening? Life is weird, okay bye. (speaking in Korean) One of my favorite things\nabout the city so far is the little strips of light that are red when you can't walk, and green when you can. It's so cool."

    "title": "The Origins of European Imperialism",
    "video_id": "vLpSeMlfZ60",
    "captions": "(drawer opening) (explorative music) - The world you live in\ntoday was sketched on paper by European men. Men who looked like me. Men who at first were just\ncurious and adventurous but soon whose motives morphed\ninto an insatiable greed. A confidence that their way\nwas better than everyone elses. This confidence led to arguably\nthe most influential series of events in human history. At least the history\nthat affects you and me, a 500 year project of moving people and weapons and germs\nand language and violence to every corner of our earth\nand in the process, gathering and taking home stuff to\nmake them richer, metal, rubber, tea, sugar, and human bodies. This isn't a history lesson. You won't hear me talk a\nlot about dates and names. Instead, this is the first of three videos where I want to show\nyou how this happened. How Europe, a continent full\nof poor, miserable farmers took over the entire\nworld, and in the process, they shaped it, they\nshaped it to their way of thinking and speaking and doing things. So this is part one of how\nEurope stole the world. (dramatic music) (relaxing music) I am out here on a bit of\nan excursion near the sea, but I wanna pause this video\nbecause I need to tell you about the sponsor of today's video, which is Better Help, a company that is trying\nto help you improve your mental health. I am a giant fan of therapy. I've said it before, I\nwill continue to say it. I think therapy is way\nunderutilized in our society. We all have mental health issues, whether we like it or not,\nwhether they're diagnosed or not, and Better Help is trying to make therapy which is just working through the things in your mind, more accessible and I'm a giant supporter of that mission. I've been in therapy for several years, it has changed the way that I think, it has changed the way that\nI approach my relationships. It has changed me, I can say that unambiguously\nand very genuinely. What Better Help is, is a\nplatform to make therapy more accessible to people,\nanyone around the whole world. It's not bound by geography. So instead of looking for a therapist like in your local town, you go on\nto Better Help, you sign up. You take a very short quiz and they match you with\nsomebody in their huge network of like tens of thousands of therapists. Once you're matched, you\ncan start communicating with a therapist in as\nlittle as like 48 hours, which if you've ever looked\nfor a therapist before, that is very, very quick. That is very easy and that's what Better\nHelp's trying to do, is just use technology to\nmake therapy more accessible. I'm a big fan of that. You can choose how you do your therapy. You can do it over the phone. You can do it over video call. You could even do it over like messaging, if you don't want to talk. Better Help is not like\na self-help program. It's not a crisis line, it's legitimate therapy\nthat is done securely on the internet. This is why over three\nmillion people are on the Better Help platform, taking control of their mental health. So if you want to get in on\nthis, try Better Help out. There is a link in my description it is BetterHelp.com/JohnnyHarris. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gives you\n10% off your first month of Better Help, so you can try it out. Better Help is already really affordable. There's even financial\naid for those who need it. Thank you Better Help for\nsupporting my channel, for supporting this video and for making therapy more accessible. Okay, now back to this\nincredibly important story on how Europe stole the world. Yes, I'm gonna be looking at a lot of maps to understand this issue because drawing on the map\nis how they did things. (dramatic music) To understand how Europe stole the world, we need to rewind to\nback when the map looked a little different, hold on. Back in like 1450, the\nworld map looked like this. I mean, Europe was just a\nbunch of smaller kingdoms. The borders look so\ndifferent than they do today. They were all pretty small potatoes. Well actually there\nactually were no potatoes. Those wouldn't arrive to\nEurope for another 50 years but the fact is there wasn't an abundance of anything in Europe. Instead, Europeans were just\nfarmers barely scraping by, constantly in debt to\na few rich landlords. Life in Europe was scarce and miserable. Meanwhile, there was a\nbunch of other empires around the world that were thriving. There was this big empire\nover in the Middle East. They had silk and then over here in India, you had a big empire with spices and luxurious cotton fabrics. Then of course there was\nthe big dynasty in China that had by this time already\ninvented gun powder, porcelain and really sophisticated ships, that they could use to\nsail around the world. Oh, and all of these empires\nwere trading with one another, making all of them even richer. They all had better\neverything than Europe did and miserable Europeans\neventually wanted in on all the trade. (funky music) So that's kind of the context\nhere that sets the stage for Europe taking over the world. The first two countries that\nwanted in on all this trade and set out to explore were\nthe countries that today we know is Spain and Portugal. So they start looking for a\nland route to get them east. They start moving east and nope. Oh, look, it's the Ottoman Empire, a very powerful Middle Eastern empire that's run by Muslims. Meanwhile, Spain and\nPortugal are hella Catholic and they're not being super\nnice to Muslims or Jews. So the Ottomans are like,\n\"No, we're not gonna let you \"pass through our land to get\nin on the trade in the east. \"Oh and by the way, you\ncan't even afford our taxes. \"You're miserable Europeans\nwithout a lot of money, \"so go away.\" They're gonna need another way to go east. Portugal's work around was literally to go around the continent of Africa. Stopping along the coast to trade with the wealthy African\nempires along the way. This is a huge moment\nbecause it actually worked. It's near the end of the 1400s and the Portuguese are now going nuts. They're sending ships around this route that they figured out,\ntrading with the east and suddenly the Portuguese are dressing in luxurious fabrics. They're using cloves and\ncinnamon and black pepper to make their food actually taste good. Wait a minute, you're telling me they didn't have black pepper before this? Geez, miserable indeed. - You must have some peppers. - So the age of exploration has begun. Miserable Europe is doing\nsomething about their situation. Going out to get in on the\nthriving trade in the east. But remember, this isn't\nabout conquering land. It's about trading, for now. (dramatic music) Okay, so now Spain sees\nPortugal hitting the jackpot and they're kind of jelly,\nthey want in on this too. They need to establish their\nown trade route to Asia but they wanted to do things\na little bit differently. Instead of following Portugal's lead and going around Africa,\nthey listen to a pitch from this Italian sailor\nand this sailor wants them to fund his new startup\ncalled what if we sailed west to get to Asia instead of\neast, super promising name. Now remember at this point,\npeople in Europe thought that the world looked like\nthis, the logic was like, oh we can just hop over to\nAsia by going this other way. So Spain was like, yes, great\nidea, high risk, high return. Do it Columbus. Well, it turns out the world\ndoes not look like this and instead over here,\nthere are a couple of massive continents that Columbus ran into. But like many of us confident white dudes, Columbus was like, yeah,\nI know exactly where I am. We're like in the Indies right now. Like over those guys over\nthere, those are Indians. Yep, I can feel it. But instead he was like in Cuba, but despite the mansplaining, Columbus kind of found exactly\nwhat he was looking for and more. Great empires with rich culture and food and precious metal that weren't\navailable to him back home, he was right on target. So he's like, \"All right,\nguys, let's trade.\" But then he is like, \"Wait a minute. \"These people don't have armies or navies \"protecting their stuff.\" So this must be kind of a different place, different land with different rules and this is where the\nbiggest light bulb moment of the century goes\noff in this guy's head. \"Change of plans, boys.\" says Columbus, \"We're going to claim this land.\" And everyone was like, \"Wait, what?\" \"You heard me, we are claiming this land.\" and the boys are like, \"Wait, \"weren't we here to like\ntrade with great empires. \"Portugal's been doing this \"for like all these\nyears and getting rich.\" and he's like, \"No,\nthey don't have armies. \"They're just letting us show up \"and like be here without a fight. \"So obviously that means they don't mind \"if we just like claim the land.\" I mean, I'm taking some\ncreative Liberty here on like explaining what\nColumbus was thinking. But like, look at the\nletter that he wrote. Here's the letter that\nColumbus wrote back to the king and queen, reporting on what he saw. He writes back saying that\nhe discovered many islands, inhabited by numerous peoples and then I took possession of them for our most fortunate king,\nmaking public proclamation and unfurling his standard, his flag, with no one making any resistance, no one making any resistance. Spain and Portugal set out to trade. They sent out to like explore\nand understand and get in on the global economy. But Columbus's realization\nwas instead of trading, they could actually just\nclaim land for themselves and this changed everything. After all, no one was\nmaking any resistance. This moment is the foundation upon which all European imperialism grows. I'll show you. (dramatic music) It's the moment that would\ngive us the first big division in the minds of Europeans. The thing we wrote on paper, the old world versus the new world. This is really familiar language to us now but it was invented in this moment. The new world was now seen as\nland that could be claimed. It was fair game to go conquer\nbecause they didn't have big armies or a Christian King. \"Forget trade with the\neast,\" said, Columbus, \"There's a bunch of land that we can go \"take over in the west.\"\nand the race was on. (inspiring music) Spain and Portugal didn't\nwanna fight with each other over all this land, this conquest that they\nwere about to undertake. So they got together and\nthey drew some lines. No, literally they just\ndrew two straight lines. We have Africa, we have Europe and then we have this line. Everything left of this line is Spains, everything to the right is Portugal. This is literally one of the original maps where they actually drew\nthese straight lines and divided the world into two. But let's look at this on a\nnicer looking map, please. There we go, now we can see very clearly. Oh, look now we understand\nwhy they speak Portuguese in Brazil. So Spain and Portugal\nnow have their spheres of the world that they can go conquer. They didn't ask anyone. They didn't negotiate with the locals. They just drew these straight lines. The Pope actually helped them\nbroker the deal, classic. But again, this is a huge\nthing that I want to explain in this series, that\nthese were not just lines. They weren't just like lines on paper. They were actually a shift\nin the paradigm, a new way of thinking about the world,\nno one making any resistance. It was a story that Europeans\ncould now tell themselves. Old world versus new world, claimed versus unclaimed,\na new way of thinking. Think I'm being overly\nsimplistic about this? Let me show you something. (dramatic music) There's one, two, three, four. These were a juicy find. I found this amazing\nPortuguese nautical Atlas. It's a bunch of maps that the\nPortuguese Navy drafted up right after these two\nlines divided the world between Spain and Portugal and it is an amazing series\nof maps, but not only because it's visually stunning, but also because it lets us into the mind of how the Portuguese saw the world after they divided it with Spain. (relaxing music) This Atlas reads like a story book. It's like the Portuguese were so giddy about giving themselves permission\nto steal half the world, that they had to write a\nchildren's story about it. That's what it feels like,\nthat's not what it is, but just look at this thing,\nhere's the title page. You can see that at the\ncenter is the sphere that was given to Portuguese. Brazil, Africa, what\nis now the East Indies and here on every corner, you see these angels that are\nblowing wind into the sales of the Portuguese who are out\non their land grab mission. So this is just the title page. The subsequent pages of\nthis Atlas are closeups on different regions. This is the Caribbean over here. Look, this will become Cuba. This will become Haiti, Dominican\nRepublic, North America, South America, all of this\nunclaimed up for grabs. Here, our story depicts all these flags. Some of them are Spanish flags\non the islands on their side of the line, but then\nyou have Portuguese flags on the Portuguese side of the line. The status of this land, according to the fantasy\nof the Portuguese, changing from unclaimed\nto claimed by men on ships with Christian crosses on their sails, showing up and planting flags. This was like playing\na board game to them. (dramatic music) Here's another page. This one's a close up on Brazil, and look, we've got people over here. We've got dark skinned, naked people with primitive tools and no homes. It looks like down here in Brazil, they spend their days chopping\nwood naked and dancing, all while being gazed upon by\nfantastical birds and dragons? This was an official Naval\nAtlas drafted for the king and if its message wasn't clear enough on how these people should be depicted, the Atlas has a little info\nbox up here where they say that the Brazilians are quote,\n\"Savage and very brutal.\" This is one of the first atlases ever made and it wasn't really a navigation tool. It was much more a declaration of a new way of seeing the world. Unclaimed territory, sub-human people, all of it up for grabs by Christian boats. So yeah, this is how it all started. Under this new paradigm, both\nempires expanded very quickly forcing the Spanish and\nPortuguese languages across the ocean, mining, vast quantities of\nsilver, creating plantations for tobacco and sugar and in the process, massacring\nthe people who were living in this new world, both\nwith their weapons, but also with their European city germs that the people being conquered\ndidn't have immunity to. I mean, this whole thing\nstarted with curiosity, with a thirst to get in\non the trade in Asia. But soon as this fantasy of unclaimed land came into the picture, the goal shifted, the project pivoted and soon\nEurope was telling themselves a new story that they,\nenlightened Christians, were entitled to claim it and while the story starts\nwith Spain and Portugal, soon it spread. Other European countries\npoked their head up from their farm work and said, \"Hey, we're white Christians\nalso, we know how to sail. \"We want in on this\nstory of unclaimed land.\" And that's the next chapter of the story. One that I will tell you in\nthe next part of the series."

And thank you, BetterHelp,\nfor supporting this channel and the journalism that I do. Let's dive back into the video. Okay, so why bread? There's a million other\nthings I could talk about that are better in other\nparts of the world, but it turns out that\nbread is the most important prepared food that humans have ever made. And therefore, it is worth talking about. So let me explain, in under a minute, the overview of the tens of\nthousands of years of history of bread and its chemistry\nand why it's so important. Don't think I can do it in under a minute? Check this out. 12,000 years ago, humans realized that they could plant this grass instead of just foraging for it. This grass was called wheat, and when it was ground up with a stone, it made this powder that,\nif you put water with it, creates this stretchy,\ngoopy thing that has a bunch of sugar from the flour\nthat's been released. Oh, look.\n- Wow. - [Johnny] All the bacteria in the air loves this sugary goop. - Nice. - And they descend to feast on it, burping out gas as they eat.\n(burping) Whoa, the gas can't float up into the air, because it's getting trapped\nin this stretchy ball of goop like a balloon, like a pillow, like magic. - Magic. - All this feasting and\nburping is making it rise and turn into a pillowy thing that is way bigger than it was. Put this blob next to some fire, and all of the little bubbles that were just created turn hard. Wait, all of this can happen\nbecause of this one grass? Yes. \"Cool, let's plant a\nlot more of this grass \"and build all of human civilization \"off of it,\" said humans.\n\u266a Society \u266a So that is bread, like the\noldest and most important prepared food item that\nhumans have ever invented. Eventually, humans got really good at doing this bread,\nflour, water, yeast thing. And especially here in France,\nthey took it really seriously and have created a whole culture around making bread delicious and amazing. And you can see that they've\ncontinued that culture today just by the number of bakeries\nthat exist in this city. There are 30,000 independent\nbakeries in France. Compare that to the 3000 that\nare in the United States. And then remember that the US has like a much larger population. And if you do all the math, you see that France has 50\ntimes more bakeries per capita than the United States. 50 times. I mean, that is such a clear indication of how much they value good bread that is baked a certain way. Here with Mr. Local over here. - Yeah!\n- Local French food in France. - Yes. 94% of regions live less than five minutes away from a bakery. (tone chiming) And that shows you they care. They care. It's like, you hear stuff\nlike that, and you're like, \"aha, this is their priority.\" And the culture of eating is\njust as much important here as how like the ingredients are sourced and prepared and whatnot. People don't eat while rushing towards their next meeting or whatever. Like it's very much, no, you\nsit down, you make it a thing. It's just a part of the way of life here. People come into the boulangeries\nalmost on a daily basis, and they check in with each other. It's like a, \"hey, how you doing?\" \"I'm doing great.\" This\nis what's happening. - Why, why, why, why? That is the question. Why are these bread cultures so different? And the answer comes down to\nwhat America was founded on. I mean, a reminder that\nAmerica is a country founded by a bunch of people\nwho left their country to go make a new life,\nto do things differently, to do things more individualistically. And the way that expressed itself for a really long time was\nmechanization industrialization. And to be clear, in the history, Britain was as much to\nblame for all of this mechanizing of bread as America was. - That's insulting! - But anyway, we're talking\nabout the USA for a little bit. So by the 1920s, you had this\nmachine that was invented, an automatic bread slicer. Hello, convenience, innovation, America. (eagle calling)\n(patriotic music) No more serrated knife\nversus a tough crusty loaf. Now the machine will do it for you. This is the greatest\nthing since sliced br... (record scratching) Oh, so that's where we're at. \"This is the greatest\nthing,\" says America, and Europe was like, \"wait,\nyeah, we like machines too, \"but like, not for bread. \"Slice this bread, and you\nmake your bread spoil faster. \"We don't need a machine\nfor sliced bread.\" But the automatic slicer was\njust the beginning for America. - Now, I'm just getting warmed up. - Now that we have sliced\nbread that, yes, spoils faster, let's make it, I don't\nknow, not spoil as fast. One way to do this is to take the part of the wheat berry that has oils in it, the husk and the bran, and get rid of it. (objects clattering)\n(cat meowing) Focus on the big, carb-loaded\nberry in the middle. But there had to be a\nmore industrial solution to make the bread last longer,\nto be whiter, to be softer. And it's the 1950s, and Europe is like, \"whoa, dude, America. Chill out. \"Like, bread is just bread. \"We've been doing this \"for literally tens of thousands of years. \"Let's just like stick to the program.\" And America's like, \"no!\" So America starts adding all\nof this stuff to their bread, bleaches and dough conditioners. And suddenly they're putting their bread into controlled chambers\nso that it will be hot enough to rise faster. And they're putting preservatives in so that their bread can now sit on a shelf for not just one or two\ndays like it should, but four days, five days, six days, a whole week, and it's still soft. It is still white. It is\nstill spongy and delicious. But it now has 15\ningredients instead of three. And it's cheap and convenient and stable, and America is loving this. And Europe is like, \"whoa.\" - Whoa.\n\"You took this way too far. \"This is not bread anymore.\" And indeed, I would argue that\nthis is not bread anymore. This is a bread-like substance. It's a different product made\nfrom a different process, and yet we use the same word for it. If you want to know more about what's inside of this kind of bread, I was actually here, making this video, when I stumbled upon a video from one of my favorite\nYouTubers, Adam Ragusea, that's like a deep dive\ninto all of the ingredients in this kind of industrial bread. Definitely go check it out. Some bread in the US has taken it so far that they will put in\nadditives that keep it spongy and soft or that\nkeep it really white, even though these additives are known to like cause cancer and inflame asthma... (coughing)\nAnd... Do all of these terrible things. Many of these additives that are legal to be put in American\nbread are literally illegal in Europe and many other countries. Azodicarbonamide...\n(X-Files theme song) Is one of 'em. This is a whitening\nagent, but you know what? This product, ADA, also helps other things stay softer, like yoga mats. ADA is in yoga mats to make them... (toy squeaking)\nSpongy and soft. And it is banned in the EU\nand many other countries. Our obsession with convenience,\ncheapness, softness, shelf life has led us down\na really dangerous path, and yet we're totally\nokay with it somehow. This is why I think\nbread is a useful symbol for broader American culture. It shows us how far we are willing to go to prioritize things like\ncheapness and convenience over tried and true methods that have been baked into culture. (drumbeat)\n(cymbal clashing) Of course, industrialized\nbread exists here as well. It doesn't have some of the\ncarcinogenic ingredients that are not allowed in the EU, but it still has all of the\ndough conditioners, bleaches, still artificially risen, all of that. The difference is that it is rare. It is much more rare here. What is much more common is the ability to go to your local bakery and get bread that only has a few ingredients, and it's the ingredients\nthat humans have been using for tens of thousands of years\nto make this staple food. - The feeling that I generally have is that this is how it should be. And then when I go elsewhere and you have other kinds of bread that last kind of bizarre amounts of time, you're like, \"this is not\nreally how it should be.\" You get calibrated to kind\nof this new standard here, and it kinda ruins you. (laughing) - It turns out Paris is lowkey one of the most bikeable\ncities I've ever been in, but it used to not be like that. Like last time I was here,\nit was not this bikeable. I smell some urban design\npolicy changes afoot here. Someone tried to change this\nin the US a few years ago, a company called Panera. - [Announcer] What could be better than a visit to Panera Bread? - It tried to bring like\nEuropean bread culture to the United States. And they did. They had a high quality, delicious bread, but what happens next is potentially the best metaphor for America. - Hello, I like money. - They got a business\nloan so they could expand, and then they got investors, and they started to expand and scale. And then they were purchased\nin a massive merger, and now they're planning to go public on the public stock exchanges. Like, they just became\na massive corporation who does not focus on making\nquality artisan bread. Instead, they're now just\na machine pumping out bread that kind of looks and\nfeels like European bread, but is now done in a uniform, mass produced, industrialized process, all in the name of scale and profit. - (gasps) Wow, they have it. Canned bread. - So the question is,\nwhy does this matter? Like, am I just being a snob who's like, \"traditional bread is\nbetter, and therefore, \"everyone should have\nit, and I hate America\"? - That was snobby. You're a snob. - No, I'm not. - Kind of, yeah, but also, it\nactually makes a difference in how it goes into your body. The beauty of bread, always, was that you could put\nthis goop out in the air, and bacteria would come down\nand start to feast on it and kind of start the digestion process. That is what natural fermentation does, is it starts to break down the wheat and make it ready to go into your body. The way that we make bread in America doesn't really leave time for this. We use heat and chemicals\nto speed this process up, to make it rise faster,\nto make it rise bigger in an artificial, synthetic way. And so you're actually getting\na much inferior product to what original bread making looks like and what it produces. Yes, it lasts longer. Yes, it tastes like chewy,\npillowy, sugary heaven, but it's not bread the way\nthat humans have been eating it for tens of thousands of years. Convenience, scale, independence. That is what we love in America. We love shelf life. We love industrialized efficiency. And to me, yeah, all that\nstuff is super great, because it means we get\nto live these wonderful, prosperous, convenient lives, but I think we lose something really big when we focus on those as the priorities as opposed to quality and\ncommunity and culture. Last thing I'll say here is\nthat this is slowly changing. You have a movement in\nthe US of people making some of the best bread in the world, using the most traditional\nmethods and ingredients. In these big cities, you have\namazing bakeries doing bread that is on par with anything\nyou could get in Europe, and that kind of blows my mind. The problem is, and my critique, is that that is still\nso rare, and specialty, and really only available to people who live in big urban areas. And meanwhile, the rest of us, the most accessible bread to us is this industrial, mass produced garbage. - Belongs in the trash. - And that is enough to\nmake me pretty frustrated.

(laughing) - It turns out Paris is lowkey one of the most bikeable\ncities I've ever been in, but it used to not be like that. Like last time I was here,\nit was not this bikeable. I smell some urban design\npolicy changes afoot here. Someone tried to change this\nin the US a few years ago, a company called Panera. - [Announcer] What could be better than a visit to Panera Bread? - It tried to bring like\nEuropean bread culture to the United States. And they did. They had a high quality, delicious bread, but what happens next is potentially the best metaphor for America. - Hello, I like money. - They got a business\nloan so they could expand, and then they got investors, and they started to expand and scale. And then they were purchased\nin a massive merger, and now they're planning to go public on the public stock exchanges. Like, they just became\na massive corporation who does not focus on making\nquality artisan bread. Instead, they're now just\na machine pumping out bread that kind of looks and\nfeels like European bread, but is now done in a uniform, mass produced, industrialized process, all in the name of scale and profit. - (gasps) Wow, they have it. Canned bread. - So the question is,\nwhy does this matter? Like, am I just being a snob who's like, \"traditional bread is\nbetter, and therefore, \"everyone should have\nit, and I hate America\"? - That was snobby. You're a snob. - No, I'm not. - Kind of, yeah, but also, it\nactually makes a difference in how it goes into your body. The beauty of bread, always, was that you could put\nthis goop out in the air, and bacteria would come down\nand start to feast on it and kind of start the digestion process. That is what natural fermentation does, is it starts to break down the wheat and make it ready to go into your body. The way that we make bread in America doesn't really leave time for this. We use heat and chemicals\nto speed this process up, to make it rise faster,\nto make it rise bigger in an artificial, synthetic way. And so you're actually getting\na much inferior product to what original bread making looks like and what it produces. Yes, it lasts longer. Yes, it tastes like chewy,\npillowy, sugary heaven, but it's not bread the way\nthat humans have been eating it for tens of thousands of years. Convenience, scale, independence. That is what we love in America. We love shelf life. We love industrialized efficiency. And to me, yeah, all that\nstuff is super great, because it means we get\nto live these wonderful, prosperous, convenient lives, but I think we lose something really big when we focus on those as the priorities as opposed to quality and\ncommunity and culture. Last thing I'll say here is\nthat this is slowly changing. You have a movement in\nthe US of people making some of the best bread in the world, using the most traditional\nmethods and ingredients. In these big cities, you have\namazing bakeries doing bread that is on par with anything\nyou could get in Europe, and that kind of blows my mind. The problem is, and my critique, is that that is still\nso rare, and specialty, and really only available to people who live in big urban areas. And meanwhile, the rest of us, the most accessible bread to us is this industrial, mass produced garbage. - Belongs in the trash. - And that is enough to\nmake me pretty frustrated.

    "video_id": "zIbNJCSCEjk",
    "captions": "(electronic music) - No, no cool intro, no fancy music. I just want to explain\ninflation in six minutes. I have a degree in economics. I spent years trying to understand this. (ominous music) so let's see if I can boil it down. What is inflation? Why is it rising? Why are people worried? And what do interest\nrates have to do with it? - The Federal Reserve is\nraising the interest rate. - [Reporter] Fed is set\nto raise interest rate. - Highest inflation in 40 years. - Listen, I know that I make long videos. I'm into nuance, I'm into backstory. Well, this isn't that. This is quick. (\"quick\" echoing) No, really, this is quick. Let's go. (rapid electronic music) Wait, wait, wait, rewind. Hold on one second. Before we start the\ntimer, I need to tell you that I was going to do an ad read in the middle of the explanation. Like I was gonna stop the\nexplanation and do an ad read, but I realized I want this\nto be an uninterrupted six-minute explanation, so I'll even take out the YouTube ads that are on it so that it can be uninterrupted.

Okay, the ad is over, let's\nstart the clock up again and see if I can do this\nexplanation in six minutes. Here we go. - Okay, first up, the simplest definition. Inflation is when there is\nmore money in the economy than stuff to spend it on. But if you're like me, the\nsimplest definition never does it for you. So let's try this. Imagine a village that has\none market where people buy all of their stuff, their\nfood, their clothes, but one day the government shows up because they're worried about\nthe economy of this village. So they tell the people\nthat if they want to take out a loan, they're gonna make sure that the banks will not charge\nthem a high interest rate. They want to encourage the\npeople to take out loans and spend money. Oh, and they also drop\noff a giant pile of cash for everyone in the village. And everyone in the\nvillage is like, \"Sweet, I'm feeling pretty rich.\" Villagers now are going to\ntheir market and they're buying way more stuff. Many of them have been eyeing\nthe fancy electric bike in the market that before\nthey couldn't justify. But now they totally can because they have all this new money. The store owner's like, \"Sweet.\nthis is great for business.\" But he's running out of bikes. In fact, he's running out of everything because now all of these\npeople have extra money and they're buying way\nmore than they used to. The store owner is like, \"I can't keep up with all this demand,\nI should raise prices.\" And that is inflation. But the village is all\nof us and the market is the entire economy. When there's extra money floating around and people wanna spend it faster than businesses can make stuff,\nthen all of the businesses in all of the industries\nraise their prices. And that is inflation. It's a natural part of the economy. It's kind of a good thing in\nsmall doses because it means that the economy is growing. And it's why movie tickets\nused to be 25 cents and now they're like $15. And slowly over time, it's fine. Okay, let's go back to the\nvillage and see what happens if we keep going at this rate. The store owner has now\ndoubled his prices on bikes. The interest rate is super low so he takes out a loan to build a new\nfactory to make bikes. This is good, he's growing a business. But the government money\neventually runs out and his prices are still double. But now the store owner\nhas no one to come buy all of his new bikes. And now he has this\nfactory and more employees, but no customers. He has to shut down the\nfactory, lay off everyone, and slowly start lowering his prices. This is called recession. When COVID shut down the world,\ngovernments gave us money, free money. They're like don't panic\nand hoard all your money, instead spend and borrow\nand keep the economy going. Here in the U.S., they\nliterally sent us $3,200 checks. They gave 600 bucks a week\nto people who were unemployed for months and months and months. They gave subsidies to people with kids. They increased spending on food stamps. I mean, trillions and trillions of dollars of stimulus money. This was vital aid to people in need, but even people who didn't lose a job got a check in the mail. It was free money for\neveryone and we spent it. - I just picked up myself a new bike. - [Reporter] Demand is\nup across the country. - It's time to grind, Peloton. - We all just got these big\nchecks from the government during a pandemic. We're like YOLO, I'm buying a\nboat or a Peloton or whatever. - [Man] Pokemon cards. - [Man] There's Netflix. - [Woman] Fortnite. - [Man] A new Motor. - [Woman] Peloton. - [Woman] Good soak in a hot tub. - [Woman] Animal Crossing. - Push it out a little bit so it-- - No, don't you dare! - But pair all this new\nspending with the fact that the pandemic also made\nit harder for factories and ships and retailers\nto get us all this stuff. - Supply chain issue. - Global supply chain. - Supply chain. - Supply.\n- Chain. - So now you have an\neconomy where people have way more money than normal\nand they're ready to spend it, but the economy can't get\nthem stuff fast enough. So what do businesses do with\nall this insane new demand? They raise prices all at the same time and that is inflation. (exhaling) I feel like we're getting\nthis at this point. But what do interest rates\nhave to do with all this? - Raising the interest rate. - Interest rate. - Or the Fed? - Fed. - Federal Reserve. - The Federal Reserve. - Most countries have a\ncentral bank, the puppet master of the economy, the bank of\nall banks for that country. But it's not like a normal\nbank that stores our money and then lends it out and\ncollects interest to make profit. That's what a normal private bank does. The central bank, which\nwe call the Fed here in the U.S. is run by the government. So their job is to set\nthe rules or policies that all the other banks have to follow. And the central bank\nisn't motivated by profit, but rather their job is to\nbabysit the economy to keep it growing, to make sure people have jobs, to make sure that prices\ndon't fluctuate too much so that we can keep growing\nnicely, no slow down, no recession, that is\nwhat the Fed is there for. But seriously, the Fed\nis like a puppet master and we are the puppets\nand it's kind of creepy. They pull strings in the\neconomy to get us to spend our money in a certain\nway, which in turn affects how much businesses raise\nor drop their prices. And guess what? It totally works. One of the strings that they have to pull in the economy is called\nthe interest rate. Wanna borrow money to buy a car or a house or expand your business? You're gonna be way more likely to do that if you only have to pay\n2% interest on that loan as opposed to like 6%. Lower interest rates equal people and businesses wanna\nborrow and spend money. So during the pandemic,\nthe central bank was like we need everyone to spend money. So they lowered the interest\nrate and people borrowed and people spent, and it totally worked. We're like freaking puppets. So a lower interest rate\nhelped stimulate the economy. But once again, we're in this\nsame place where there's now too much money to borrow and\nspend and not enough goods and services to spend it on. So what do businesses\ndo all at the same time? They raise prices to\nmeet all this new demand all at the same time and now\nyour money is worth less. And that is inflation. - [Reporter] Home prices\nrising at their highest rate. - [Man] Astronomical bidding war. - Are going up.\n- By nearly 24%. - So that's what's happening right now. All the prices are rising\nkind of at the same time. What that means is that\nyour hundred dollar bill is now worth 8% less than it was last year. Like the same money is worth less because your purchasing\npower just got diluted. And imagine if that keeps happening? Like instead of 8% it's 50%? Now your hundred dollar bill\nis worth what $50 used to be. And that's when people start to freak out. And our economy that's built\non human psychology starts to falter and we fall into\na recession or a depression, even, if it gets real\nbad, which is exactly what the Fed is built to avoid. So they're back to pulling their strings and they've started raising rates. - The Federal Reserve is\nraising interest rates. - The Federal Reserve taking\naction to try and curb rising inflation. - They're gently raising the\ninterest rate to cool down all of this hardcore\nspending and borrowing, see if they can steer\nthe ship back on course. And let's hope it works. Okay, did we do it? Did we do, did we do it in the time period that I promised I would? - [Nick] I have no idea. - We'll find out. (jazz music) Okay, last thing I wanna say\nis a thing that didn't make it into my little inflation explainer, but a few years ago when I worked at Vox, I went to Venezuela and\nColumbia to do a borders series. I saw inflation up close and\npersonal because in Venezuela, inflation got so out of\ncontrol and they couldn't, the Fed, the puppet\nmaster couldn't figure out how to get it back in control that their money became worth nothing. The prices went up so high that their money became\nbasically worthless. You needed like a pile\nof cash to buy bread. So what they started doing\nis they started using the currency itself to make things. I visited this guy on\nthe street who was making purses and bags and sculptures out of cash because it was worth more as\na raw material than it was as money, as a currency, which is insane. That's a very extreme\nversion of inflation. It's happened in several\ncountries that have done this. We're not in that situation,\neven close to that situation, but it's an example of just how tenuous modern economies are. They're not pegged to gold or whatever. They're pegged to a\nbunch of humans believing that this stuff is worth something and it can quickly go off the rails. So I thought I'd share\nthat little, fun thing that is more documented\nin the Vox borders episode that you can go watch on\nthe Vox YouTube channel. So that's all I've got. Thank you all for being here and I think you should check\nout, if you want to color your videos or your photos,\nI have LUTs and presets that you can use to\ncolor correct your stuff. I also have a storytelling course on Bright Trip where I\ntalk about my methodology for visual storytelling\nwith Nathaniel Drew. I think that's sort of it,\nall the plugs I should do at the end of these videos,\nbut yeah, lots more to come. We're working on lots of amazing videos and I'm really excited to share them. So I'll see you in the next one. Bye, everyone. Okay."

    "captions": "a warning the content of this story may be disturbing for some of you last fall a frozen dead body was brought into this portland hotel then tickets were sold and the ticket holders were let into this room while they watched this dead body be cut into and taken apart examined for a pain audience some reporters from a local tv station from seattle caught wind of this and secretly filmed the whole thing at times the professor encourages attendees to poke and prod the body they found that this dead body had belonged to a man named david saunders a world war ii veteran from louisiana he had died last year and had chosen to donate his body to science but here he was a few months later on display at a public event in an oregon hotel where people paid hundreds of dollars to watch this live autopsy these weren't doctors or med students in attendance these were just everyday people who had bought tickets to the oddities and curiosities expo it is chris hard to believe that this kind of thing could actually be legal this is not what david saunders signed up for he donated his body to be used for training doctors and improving medicine not for a live public autopsy with 500 tickets how is this possible how can someone just purchase a dead body when it comes to bodies some critics have called the wild west out there that there really are no rules i got really curious about this industry and i wanted to dive in and understand what is going on here as usual it turned into kind of a deep dive suddenly i was digging through documents and suddenly i'm looking into the details of organ transplants and cadavers and funeral homes and what i learned through all of this is that once you're done with your body there is a thriving market of people who want to get their hands on it the owner is selling body parts the fbi says grizzly details before we dive fully into cadavers let's do a commercial break so i can thank today's sponsor which is better help i'm really

battery's not included [Applause] okay dead bodies never thought i'd be going into dead bodies but here we are let's just say one thing up front doctors like to learn how to be doctors using real human bodies like medical students can't really practice hip replacements on living people so they use the bodies of dead people which are called cadavers oh and this isn't a new thing studying dead bodies can be traced back like thousands of years to ancient egypt and greece but then it had a comeback in like the 16th and 1700s in europe working on dead bodies allowed physicians to actually see how bodies are organized the most important factor in the study of health and disease is man himself to understand how diseases spread which in turn benefits the living there was such a demand for dead bodies that the government in england actually passed this murder act that said any murderer who is hanged or executed could be given to a medical school and studied and then to keep filling the demand they actually like started hanging more criminals so that they could have bodies to study but demand was still too high higher than the supply of hanged criminals which led to the rise of grave robbing [Music] people were robbing graves in the name of science and it was seen as a big problem but then again there's this tension here which is like they're using these bodies to learn to like understand how to do medical procedures and that's better for humans eventually expanded the law to say anyone who was unclaimed didn't have family come claim them could be used as cadavers but even still during the 16th 17th and 1800s when all of this medical progress is happening the demand for cadavers totally outstripped the supply there was not enough dead bodies and then in the 1960s america is like wait a minute did someone say supply and demand i smell a free market why don't we just give people the option to donate their bodies so that we don't have to just wait for criminals and unclaimed people and some people were like yeah but now we have these synthetic models that are really good and they're just like bodies so we don't actually need real bodies and the doctors were like no there's nothing like it there's no replacement so thus begins the era of body donation wait a minute is this the same as being an organ donor the answer is no i'm an organ donor i mean this is my driver's license and when i got my driver's license when i was 16 i checked the box i want to be an organ donor if someone needs a heart transplant or a kidney and i suddenly die of an accident i'm totally down with giving my heart to somebody else so that they can live absolutely but it turns out that organ donation and giving your body over to science are two totally different things okay so we have two categories here one is the transplant category which is like the organ donation it means removing body parts that are going to be put back into another living person this is what i opted for by becoming an organ donor on my driver's license let me just play out the scenario of how this works using my friend sheila sheila is from texas she was in a bad accident and had a traumatic brain injury she's currently in the hospital on life support and has zero brain activity the hospital kind of knows where this is going and so they call a company called an organ procurement company an opo and they tell them that hey sheila's gonna die soon the opo company verifies that sheila is on the organ donor list they quickly connect with her family to tell them that they will be honoring her wishes by donating her organs once she passes and then the company asks sheila's family if they would also allow her tissues to be donated and the family inevitably responds with tissues what do you mean and they explain that in addition to her organs they could also use her skin her bones her eyes to help with all kinds of medical devices and treatments they tell sheila's family that one tissue donor can heal the lives of more than 75 people so the family agrees once sheila dies her heart lungs liver pancreas intestines kidneys are all removed put on ice and sent all around the country to hospitals where people are in desperate need of organs to stay alive they've been sitting on a waiting list for months or even years and today is their day thanks to sheila and her donation of her organs oh and this happens really fast like within hours because these organs can't stay alive outside of a body for long then they take out her tissues her heart valves are sent to a nearby hospital to help people with heart defects her skin is sent to iowa to help reconstruct a child's cleft palate her corneas are sent to an eye bank in louisiana to help restore eyesight and some of her body fat tissue is sent to california to be made into injectable lip fillers that does that's not saving lives but yeah that's a part of this too anyway back to sheila after all of her organs and tissues have been taken out of her and sent around the country she gets stitched up and returned to her family where they can then bring her to a funeral home and prepare her for her funeral honestly it's a modern miracle that we can even do this it saves tons of lives every year and i'm totally down with being an organ donor not really into my fat being used as lip injections but whatever i'm down with the system now i want to talk about the other category the non-transplant industry this is the one that i've been thinking a lot about lately and that i had no idea existed until i started diving into this video let me explain how it works on this side of things and i'll do so with my friend sean these are not real people like sheila is not a real person sean is not a real person these are invented characters in the name of explaining this process thank you for your concern sean lives in arizona he's at the end of his life and he's at a hospice care one day someone shows up to the hospice they are from a non-transplant anatomical donation organization or a nado or i'm just going to call it a body broker body broker person approaches sean and pitches this idea that sean could donate his body to science shawn responds with oh you mean like becoming an organ donor i'm already an organ donor says sean kind of says the body broker guy but kind of different they explain that sean can leave a lasting legacy with his anatomical gift that will train future doctors these are real marketing terms that body brokers use oh and best of all sean there's no cost in donating in fact the company will pay for a cremation so that he doesn't have to this is starting to sound really good to sean he likes the idea of donating his body to science and he's very aware that his family doesn't really have the money to pay for a proper funeral which can cost like six to ten thousand dollars all that can be covered by this body broker so he's into it sean signs the papers tells his family hey i'm not going to get buried i'm going to donate my body to science a few weeks later sean dies and the body broker that shawn signed with comes and picks up his body bring it to his facility where they properly embalm it and then they take it apart shawn is now a cadaver a former body that exists now in a dozen or so parts that sit in a freezer are shipped around the country and world for a variety of purposes his head is rented to a university in pennsylvania where medical students are studying neuroscience it is then returned and rented again to a university in ecuador for the same purpose shawn's foot is then rented to a medical device company that makes screws and plates for ankle surgery the company has a new product a metal plate that they want to show off to surgeons so they send shawn's foot to a medical conference in las vegas where they fly a surgeon out first class and pay him to demonstrate how this new device this plate works on sean's foot a real cadaver specimen they want the surgeons to buy the plate his arm is then sold to another medical device company in idaho where they are testing a product that helps with carpal tunnel it's not approved yet but they're doing all this r d and they use shawn's hand to run a few more tests so that it can be approved go on the market and make the money his upper torso is sold to another medical device company that is hosting an all-inclusive event at a convention center in san diego where they're showing off their new titanium sternum something they want surgeons to use so they fly out all these surgeons they give them food and drinks and accommodations all of this paid for by the medical device company their hope is that these surgeons will have a good time see the product being used on a real cadaver and leave wanting to use that product in the next surgery a new customer sean's remaining lower half is sold to the department of defense the u.s military and they use it in a u.s army blast experiment where the u.s army uses it to test the effects of a new bomb on human tissue on a real human body and after about a year and a half what remains of sean is cremated and those remains are sent back to the family here's my issue with this sean wanted to donate his body to science i'm not sure he was exactly signing up to be the test subject for a multi-million dollar medical device industry but he was helping science right medical devices are science and his body was used by students at a med school but did sean know that that's what science was defined as i mean that body on that table in portland being dissected at the oddities and curiosities expo that body was obtained through this market through this system was that science so this is why i feel a little uneasy about this i don't think this is a bad corrupt industry i just think it has some problems okay hold on i'm gonna bring you over to my very messy desk so that you can look at a couple of documents with me okay so let me just make one thing clear here i'm not trying to do some expose on cadavers in the cadaver industry like this stuff helps people we can go into an operating room and have a surgeon operate on us knowing that they've practiced on cadavers i am in total support of that my issue with this industry is much more with all of the incentives the monetary incentives that are baked into this market that lead to some abuses let me explain what i mean [Music] the first thing i'm most concerned about is the lack of regulation there's not a lot of regulation on what these body brokers have to divulge and explain to the person who is donating their body we've been documenting how these body brokers market the idea of giving up your body supporting medical research advancements medical advancements advances in medical and physician training improvements in the quality of life for generations to come no cost no cost anatomical gift a powerful gift no greater gift benefiting humanity and providing hope for future generations donate your body to science this stuff is framed as an altruistic donation to future generations and so while there's real truth in that what we don't see is the reality of what happens after your body is donated when you have a profit incentivized market and companies often what you see is these companies going to great lengths to get their profits higher and higher one thing we found in our reporting is these body brokers have started working with funeral homes so now they have an arrangement where the funeral home will get a kickback they'll get paid a commission if they can sell the grieving family on donating their loved one's body to this body broker reuters did some really good reporting around this in 2017 and found dozens of funeral homes that have this mutually beneficial business relationship like sales relationship with body brokers this is exactly my issue with all of this the funeral home now has an incentive to push body donation onto these families there's one guy who was the head of a body broker who said he wanted to build his business to be the mcdonald's of body parts i did it that's 200 for me now look we looked into a lot of these body brokers some of them are sketchy a lot of them are not we went through the consent agreements for a ton of these body burgers honestly a lot of these do a really good job of painting an accurate picture like this one from ohsu in portland it makes you sign that you understand that upon my death my body will be embalmed dissected disarticulated or plastinated for permanent preservation part of these procedures may take a small amount of anatomical material recoverable or destroyed in the process this is how it should work there should be total transparency but unfortunately that's not how it happens all the time again this is the wild west it is the free market there is so little regulation that anyone and i mean anyone can get into the donation business so let me explain to you the horror stories of what happens in an unregulated market where there's profit incentives viewer discretion advised the company violated everything they promised this is just wrong on so many levels chop shop for human body parts illegally sold body parts against donors wishes one company was cutting up bodies with a chainsaw and not really tracking where the bodies went the body parts were never reunited and the cremated remains that were given to the family members may not be the cremated remains the owner was eventually charged with fraud but the charges were dropped because there aren't any laws for this here's another one that that reuters investigation covered in 2015 there was a neighborhood in southern nevada and the neighbors were complaining about like some foul smells as well as like bloody boxes in the dumpsters so health inspectors showed up and they found a worker holding a garden hose thawing a frozen human torso outside in the afternoon sun there was like bits of tissue and blood that were like being washed into the neighborhood gutter like what a nightmare but again because there's no rules or laws here like nothing could be done the last one i'll tell you about and then i'll spare you the rest happened in 2014 when the fbi raided the biological resource center in arizona and found what an agent called various unsettling scenes [Music] i think we in the u.s love a good supply and demand story but we have built a market with the right incentives to create so much supply that we actually have an excess and we ship cadavers to other countries speaking of other countries i put a call out on instagram to all of you in the rest of the world that is not the united states asking how you deal with cadavers what's the culture around cadavers in your country and i got some really cool responses leon from croatia said that once the cadavers are done being used for research the remains are buried in this famous beautiful tomb sophie said that in austria there's a ceremony to honor donated bodies that their remains are buried in a mass grave fabia told me that in portugal there's a yearly ceremony in the medical community to pay tribute to the bodies that were used for learning the same thing happens in canada according to ellen and then there's taiwan yielding shay told me that students refer to the cadavers as their teachers and then there's a memorial organized to honor them before the first incision ever takes place students will sometimes even visit the families of the cadavers that they worked on to like learn about the people that they were thailand does something similar people who donate their bodies to science get a really honorable title and then medical students and monks will come together in a ceremony to pay tribute to these people who gave their bodies for science and learning when the body has fulfilled its use and it's no longer useful for learning they do a cremation and have a ceremony to thank these bodies even we'll memorialize all of the donors names in like a pamphlet to say like thank you thank you for teaching us so the question is this should you be scared to donate your body and the answer is absolutely not in the beginning of this video i talked about the situation of that world war ii veteran being dissected in front of a pain audience a horrible thing but again i hope i made it clear that sort of thing is not common in fact the body broker who rented this body for the event released a statement saying that they were deceived most body brokers in my view from what i've done in my reporting are ethical and transparent and are are respectful but it's the few that take advantage of the lack of regulation that i think calls for more attention from the government so that people can actually feel confident in donating their bodies and knowing that they're going to go to actually advancing scientific research and products i did it that's 200 it's operation the wacky doctors game where you're the wacky doctor so if i were thinking about donating my body to science what i would do is go to a university and say hey do you have a program where someone can submit their body to be used in your research and if they do you can be guaranteed that your body will be used to train medical students if you do decide to donate through a for-profit company look to see if that company has been certified by the american association of tissue banks which often means they've been vetted they're not just like some rogue prophet seeking person in fact if you want to go on to the website of this association you can find a body broker that is accredited also read the documents all these disclosures have a bunch of fine print on how your body will be used if you donate it oh and i just want to say one last thing about organ donation which is different than full body donation only two percent of registered organ donors like me end up successfully donating their organs because the only way that they can get my organs out and get them transplanted into somebody else is if i die in a hospital on a ventilator that is why only two percent of organ donors actually get their organs procured so it's really important that if you want to be an organ donor you make sure you are signed up there are a hundred thousand people right here in the u.s right now who are waiting for a transplant and the more donors there are the more likely they will find a match i'm gonna put links to resources where you can learn more about organ donation and whole body donation as well as really good reporting by reuters and the l.a times and others on this topic a human body represents a life and it deserves to be treated with respect no matter if it's donated cremated or buried my hope in making this video is that you'll better understand what this industry looks like why it exists why it needs to be regulated and maybe you'll consider participating in it because i do believe that donating your body to science can help improve our world and honestly once my body dies i'm kind of totally down with it having a renewed purpose i just want to know what that purpose is and how it will be used so thank you for watching so i want to welcome the hundreds of thousands of new subscribers who have come to this channel in the past few weeks welcome um yes i usually do international relations topics but really what i do on this channel is curiosity i'm a curious person and i dive into things and i learn about them and then i usually share them with you and so that's what this video is and there's a lot more to come just a reminder that i have a patreon for anyone who wants to support patreon i have uh presets and luts which is how i color my videos and photos i have a storytelling course on brighttrip which is a platform that i co-founded a few years ago where i tell you all about storytelling and my view on video storytelling with nathaniel drew who's also another video storyteller so those are a few things that are in the description if you want to check them out thank you all for being here and i mean look at you you're at the very end of this video like you are at the like last few seconds of a very long video and you're just still here that's amazing so thanks for being here until the very end see you"

    "title": "The case of Julian Assange, Explained",
    "video_id": "P6bVl47kdNk",
    "captions": "(emergency sirens) - [Johnny] On a spring day, 10 years ago, a 41 year old Australian man\nnamed Julian Assange dressed up as a motorcycle delivery man. He dyed his hair, put\ncolored contacts in his eyes, and even put a rock in his shoe so that he would walk\ndifferently than normal. He was sure he was being followed\nby dark government forces that were attempting to capture him and send him to the United\nStates to be locked up. He showed up here to\nthe Embassy of Ecuador in Central London. Once inside this embassy, he wouldn't be on British soil anymore. No one could barge in here and grab him. He'd be safe. It's called political asylum. Oh, and by the way, this isn't actual footage\nof Julian Assange in 2012. - [Director] Action. - [Crew] You look great. - This is an actor. We did a reenactment of this whole thing. Anyway. (suspenseful music) Assange did make it inside that day. And after entering the\nEcuadorian Embassy in London, he wouldn't leave it for seven years. Testing one, two, three, I've been looking at a lot of this. I've actually started hanging\nup the documents over here because they've been\ntaking up too much space. I want to tell you the\nstory of Julian Assange. - [Man] This guy's a traitor. - [Man] Saddle up WikiLeaks. - [Hillary] This is a blow to transparency and a blow to a free press. - What this story is,\nis like an expression of a new kind of power, the power of secrets, of information. - An anti-war online organization attacking US policy in Afghanistan. - And the reason I'm calling\nwhat Julian Assange does power is because the US is trying\nto lock him up for 175 years because of what he did. It's all here in this indictment. The most powerful country in\nthe world feels threatened by this man and what he's done. I want to take you through\nJulian Assange's story, and then to unpack why the United States is trying to lock him up\nfor the rest of his life. And I want to persuade you\nthat no matter what you think of Julian Assange and his\nconduct and his ethics and his mission, this case\nshould not be ignored. (upbeat music) - Illegally shoot the son of a (beep). - [Woman] Get Assange to\nSweden and hang on to him. - [Man] Crazy Horse 187, we\nhave 5 distinct individuals with AK-47s. - Never know what the outcome is, but the truth is always\nthe best place to start. (gunfire erupts) - Okay wait, before we\ndive into this video, I want to thank today's\nsponsor because the sponsors are the people who make\nthese videos possible. They allow me to do this as my job. Thank you. NordVPN for\nsponsoring today's video. If you don't know what a VPN is, it's kind of just like an\nall around protective tool that you don't actually see\nor interact with very much. It works in the background.

An example is entertainment. Like there are things\navailable in the UK on Netflix that are not available here\nin the US, but with a VPN, I can connect and get access\nto all of that content. Also, it works the other way. I'm traveling a lot more lately. And when I'm in a different country, my computer and all the things\nI'm logged into kind of freak out, 'cause I think I'm like\na hacker from somewhere else. So, I connect to a server\nin the United States and my internet thinks\nI'm in the United States and they don't kick me\nout of like my Gmail. It's not complicated to connect. You don't have to be like technical or like understand how it works. You just press a button\nand you're connected. Oh, and recently Nord VPN\nis not just a VPN anymore. They had this whole new\nthreat protection system. It blocks malware. It blocks trackers. It blocks malicious ads. It allows you to surf the\ninternet much more safely. This is a very affordable tool. And if you want to get in on it, do us both a favor and go\nto Nordvpn.com/JohnnyHarris, where you can get an exclusive deal to get a great deal on a VPN.

So go check it out, go see\nif it works for your life, makes your life better. Nordvpn.com/JohnnyHarris. Thank you, Nord VPN for\nsupporting the videos that I do. I really appreciate it. Now let's get back into the story. Okay, let's get up to speed really quickly on who this guy even is\nand how he ended up trapped in an embassy in London. Julian Assange is an Australian hacker who spent most of his life\nbreaking into computers and getting his hands on information that he wasn't supposed to see, but that he believed the world should see. When he was 35, he built a website where whistle blowers of all kinds could upload sensitive information\nthat he, Julian Assange, on his new website would publish. And the upside of all of this\nwas that these whistle blowers would remain totally anonymous. He claimed that even he wouldn't\nknow who his sources were. So that was 2006. Julian Assange builds WikiLeaks. And soon after, he starts\nreceiving submissions, like people start giving him\ndocuments that are supposed to be secret. And he starts publishing them. Everything from drone strikes in Yemen to oil scandals in Peru to\ncorruption in the Arab world, Tibetan uprisings in China. Leaks like this sort of\nseem common to us now, but this was like 2007. WikiLeaks was a totally new thing. It was this open source\nintelligence website acting in the name of no\ngovernment with no location. But with this very idealistic vision of making the world's\ninformation, totally transparent, exposing corruption,\nexposing government secrets. - Understand how far\nyou can push government into doing something that is\njust by exposing injustice. - But WikiLeaks wasn't\nreally noticed until 2010, when something happened that\nwould change everything. (suspenseful music) In Iraq, there was a 22 year old American Intelligence Analyst\nnamed Chelsea Manning. Horrified by what she\nwas seeing, she decided to download hundreds of\nthousands of classified documents from military computers and upload them directly to WikiLeaks. (suspenseful music continues) - Of course our top story\nthis morning, the White House blasting the release of over\n90,000 US military records. - It was the biggest leak in history. And this is the stuff\nwe've been looking through over the past few weeks. Hundreds of thousands of\nclassified documents containing never before seen details on\nhow the US conducts its war, its diplomacy, its intelligence. I mean, let me show\nyou some of this stuff. Now let me just do a\nquick disclaimer here, going through these leaks, there is a lot of like\nhorrific stuff like, stuff I just don't even\nwant to talk about here. I'll go over it kind of in vague terms and let you go read the rest. But war is horrible. And what these documents reveal is like a detailed version of that. - My fellow citizens, at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages\nof military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger. - In these leaks, we\nlearn about secret raids. We read about scenes\nof US military people, executing Iraqi families. We also get a lot of data. The US military claimed that it wasn't keeping\ntrack of deaths in Iraq, but these leaks showed\nthat they actually were. And that the number of casualties,\nincluding civilian deaths was actually way higher\nthan anyone thought before. The leaks also revealed\nthis classified footage that again, I'm not\ngonna show all of it here or even the worst parts. - [Soldier] There's more\nthat keep walking by and one of them has a weapon. - [Dispatch] Relevant, copy that one six. - [Soldier] That's a weapon. - [Johnny] It shows a US helicopter firing on a group of Iraqis, who\nthey thought were insurgents, but was really just a family, including children walking\nwith two Reuters journalists. - [Soldier] (beep) prick. - [Crazy Horse 1-8] Hotel two six, this is Crazy Horse one eight. - [Johnny] They were\ncarrying cameras, not guns. - [Soldier] Request permission to engage. - [Soldier] C'mon let us shoot. - [Johnny] And yet in this video, you see them open fire on these people. - [Dispatch] So, uh, you\nare free to engage, over. - [Man] Let me know when you got 'em. - [Soldier] Let's shoot. - [Man] Light 'em all up. - [Soldier] Come on, fire. (rapid gunfire erupts) - [Soldier] Oh yeah, look\nat those dead bastards. - [Soldier] Nice. - [Soldier] Well it's their\nfault for bringing their kids to a battle. - [Soldier] That's right. - You read about this scene\nwhere an Apache helicopter is flying over some insurgents in a house who are surrendering, they're\ncoming out of their house with their hands up. And yet the Apache\nhelicopter gets the clearance to fire on them. And their justification is\naccording to this leaked log, you're not allowed to\nsurrender to aircraft. They're still valid targets. I mean, it's horrendous. As a journalist, I'm\nskeptical, I'm like, okay, these are like two or three bad apples is this what we're staring at? But no, through these leaks,\nyou see that 15,000 civilians were killed in previously\nunknown incidents. 15,000! These documents reveal a\nculture and a system of abuse and torture in Iraq, mostly\nby the Iraqi military and army that the US military knew about, but did nothing to solve. And the only reason why\nwe know about it now is because Chelsea Manning gave WikiLeaks all of these documents. There's one Department of\nState leak from the Embassy in Belgium that shows that the\nUS tried to pressure Belgium into taking some of the\nprisoners from Guantanamo Bay in order to curry favor with the US. you see the US being like, hey Belgium, take some of these Guantanamo prisoners. It's a low cost way for\nBelgium to attain prominence in Europe, like it's backroom deals exchanging Guantanamo\nprisoners for political favors. We would've not known any of this had these leaks not come out. All of this turned out\nto be a very grim insight into how the US is conducting its wars and unsurprisingly, after these\ngiant leaks came out in 2010 and 2011 on WikiLeaks,\nthe Pentagon was furious. - This was dumped on us. Like it was dumped on\nyou all Sunday night. - It is the role of good journalism to take on powerful abuses. And when powerful abuses are taken on, there is always a back reaction. - Julian Assange's website had gone from being a small hacker\nwebsite with some leaks to something that now\nhad worldwide attention. - This isn't a WikiLeak. This is a Wiki torrent. - [Reporter] These\ndocuments have generated a mix of reactions from\nhorrified to appalled. - [Johnny] And Assange,\nhimself, became the public face for this and he became really polarizing. He was either praised as\na courageous journalist. - The role that Julian Assange has played in exposing uncomfortable\ntruths is something that he should be very proud of. - WikiLeaks is no different\nfrom the New York Times. - He just believes in\njustice, believes in honesty, believes in exposing governments. - Or he was reproached\nand condemned as a villain who was set on damaging\nthe US security interest and putting people in\ndanger in the process. - I hope he rots in\nhell, starting with that. - This guy's a traitor, a treasonist and he has broken every\nlaw of the United States. Illegally shoot the son of a (beep). - But regardless of what the\npublic thought about him, the reality is the US government\nnow felt like they were at war with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. - The United States strongly\ncondemns the illegal disclosure of classified information. There have been examples in history in which official conduct\nhas been made public in the name of exposing\nwrongdoings or misdeeds. This is not one of those cases. - And the next chapter of his\nlife would be spent trying to avoid being sent to\nthe US to face them. And this is why Julian Assange went to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Okay, so after this huge\nleak, it's now like 2012. Assange is living in London and he's actually facing the possibility of being sent to Sweden\nto face an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations. And even though this Sweden\ninvestigation legally has nothing to do with\nthe big leaking thing that he had done, Assange\nwas convinced that the UK and Sweden were working with the US to try to get Assange back onto\nUS soil to face trial. So instead of go and participate\nin the investigation, he fled to seek political\nasylum inside the walls of this embassy, (upbeat music) An embassy is kind of\nlike a little enclave within a country. Like, this is a little slice\nof Ecuador within London. So the UK couldn't do anything. They couldn't go storm into an embassy. So instead they just\npositioned a ton of police outside of the embassy. And this is the moment, this\nspectacle of all these police sitting outside of the embassy, where you realize that\nthis is a huge deal. On paper, this was actually\na really small deal. The US wanted to arrest\nAssange to send him to Sweden, to face this sexual\nmisconduct investigation. But all of this shows us that this is not about a\nsmall investigation in Sweden. The US wanted Assange to\npunish him for what he did and the UK, it was looking\nlike was ready to help them. So while Assange is in\nthe walls of this embassy, he's protected and the US\nwould have to wait him out, building their case, but\nwait a minute, hold on. What exactly are we\ncharging Assange with here? He published a bunch of leaked documents. So what's the crime here. And honestly that is\nthe heart of this story. What crime did he commit? I'm gonna get there. I want to just finish the\nstory of what happens next. Julian Assange is in an embassy in London, the weeks turn into months and\nthe months turn into years. And Julian Assange is living\nin an embassy, not leaving. He occasionally comes\nout onto this balcony to deliver a speech to his\nincreasingly large support base. (crowd cheering) - Can you hear me? - [Crowd] Yeah! - But like this guy is\nconfined to the embassy. - Right, I joked it's a\nlittle bit like living in a space station because\nthere's no natural light and there's, you've gotta\nmake all your own stuff and you can't go out to shops and so on. - From the embassy, Assange\ncontinues to run WikiLeaks. He publishes troves of secret documents. It is from the embassy that he declares his\nhate for Hillary Clinton. - The American liberal press\nin falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton,\nare erecting a demon that is going to put nooses\naround everyone's necks. - And it is here that\nhe orchestrates a plan to damage her campaign by\nstrategically publishing emails that were stolen from the Democratic Party and from Clinton's Campaign\nChair, John Podesta, WikiLeaks posted these\nemails in daily batches throughout October 2016 a\nmonth before the election. Soon, mounting evidence\nshowed that WikiLeaks got these emails, potentially unknowingly, from a Russian government\nagent who, like Assange, was trying to damage the Clinton Campaign. The leaked emails helped\nthe Trump Campaign and quickly made Assange an\nenemy of American progressives who had tended to support\nAssange and WikiLeaks because they were keeping the government and the military accountable,\nbut now they hated them. - WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. - So now it's 2017 and Trump is President. - This WikiLeaks is unbelievable. - Assange is still in the embassy and from the embassy,\nAssange and WikiLeaks drop another huge leak. This time of CIA documents. It revealed the playbook of the CIA's cyber warfare strategy. Releasing all of these\ndocuments had one major result, making all of the CIA's\ntools completely worthless. Trump who had praised WikiLeaks for like helping him get\nelected now hated WikiLeaks. - I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing. - WikiLeaks walks like a\nhostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile\nintelligence service. - So by 2019, Julian Assange\nis still in the embassy and now he's pissed off everyone\nfor one reason or another. It's at this time that the\nTrump administration starts to really get serious about\nhow do we get this guy and how do we punish him\nseverely for what he's done. They start upping the ante on their case against Julian Assange. But Assange starts to get\nreally restless in the embassy. I mean, can you blame him? It's been like seven years. He starts to mistrust his host. And in turn, his host,\nthe Ecuadorian diplomats are getting kind of tired of him. His poor hygiene, his\nhabit of playing football in the hallways. Meanwhile, Ecuador's new\npresident is like less sympathetic to WikiLeaks because he\nwas actually the subject of some embarrassing leaks himself. He actually called\nAssange a miserable hacker whose only goal is to\ndestabilize governments. And so they kicked him out. - The British Police\nwere seemingly invited into this very small embassy. - [Johnny] Seven years after he had walked into this building, Assange finally left. - [Assange] We must resist. - He was immediately arrested. Again on paper, the UK\ngovernment wanted him because of this sexual\ninvestigation in Sweden from 2012. That investigation had been dropped. And yet the UK kept him\nin jail because the US had formally requested\nAssange to be extradited, which basically means one\ncountry asked another country to detain and send a criminal\nback to their country to face charges. The UK would hear and\nassess the US's request and in the meantime, Assange would sit in the Belmarsh Prison, 45\nminutes from Central London. And that's where he is\ntoday when I'm filming this and he's not doing great. He's been examined by doctors and by the UN representative for torture. And they've basically\nconcluded that Assange has experienced severe\npsychological trauma because of his isolation in\nthe embassy and now in jail, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety, intense psychological trauma. The British government, of\ncourse, disagreed with this. But the UN has said\nthat he has been subject to psychological torture\nand other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of punishment. They also claim that he's\nbeen medically neglected. Many are calling this\nretaliation, punishing Assange, not legally, but through\nthese really inhumane ways of not giving him medical treatment, isolating him in ways\nthat aren't warranted. And now is the moment where\nwe need to remind ourselves why this man is in jail. Not because he's been\ncharged with a crime, but because he published\nhundreds of thousands of classified documents\nthat an Army Intel Analyst, Chelsea Manning gave to him\nand the US wants to punish him. So, he's rotting in a jail\nwaiting for the legal process on whether or not he's gonna\nget sent back to the US to face these charges. And to me, this gets to\nthe most important part of this story, because what happens next affects not just Julian\nAssange and his story, but it could set a\nprecedent for all of us. Those of us who do journalism and those of us who rely\non journalism to teach us about the world. What I want to do next is I\nwanna dive into this stuff. I want to walk you through\nthese two documents, which are basically the US's\ncase against Julian Assange as laid out by the Trump\nadministration in 2018. It's daunting. It's a lot of stuff. It's a lot of legal jargon,\nbut I've been through it all. And I want to explain why this matters. Okay, let's do this. Oh shit. Here we go. Okay. Okay. So, stick with me as I\nexplain the legal case against Julian Assange and\nwhat that means for journalism. (inquisitive music) The thing that the Department\nof Justice focuses on is the events of 2010 when Assange received tons of\nclassified cables and war logs from Intel Analyst, Chelsea Manning, who was previously Bradley Manning, has transitioned to Chelsea Manning. Manning had a security clearance, violated that security clearance and ended up serving seven years in prison for leaking all of this\nstuff to WikiLeaks. It would've been 35 years if Obama hadn't lessened her sentence. So the US focuses on\nthis super giant leak. They start out by reminding us just how many documents were leaked. If you add this up, it's like over 700,000\nclassified documents were leaked to the world. And then they go into the actual crimes. What they see as the\ncrimes, there's 18 counts, basically 18 instances where\nthey allege he broke the law. In total, this would be a\nsentence of 175 years in prison. Luckily we don't have to\ngo through all 18 counts to understand them because\nthey fit pretty nicely into three main buckets,\nhacking, aiding, and publishing. First, let's go into\nhacking, the first bucket. - [Hillary] It's about\nassisting the hacking. - This first allegation is the least scary for Julian Assange. It basically says that\nAssange worked with Manning to crack a password on\na government computer so that Manning could grab\ndocuments without being detected. Incidentally, it didn't work. They didn't crack the password, but the indictment alleges\nthat he tried and therefore, it is considered a conspiracy\nto commit computer fraud, which is a violation of this\nlike eighties era law called the Computer Fraud Abuse Act. It has a max sentence of five years, which for Julian Assange\nis not that big of a deal, given that he spent seven\nyears in the Ecuadorian Embassy evading the charges. Okay, so that's the first\none, the least severe. The other 17 counts\nallege that Julian Assange violated the Espionage Act. - [Hillary] He has to\nanswer for what he has done. - Wait, what? The Espionage Ace, hold on. You know I printed it off and read through the Espionage Act. I mean, look at that cool font. The Espionage Act is really intense. It was passed in 1917 when\nwe were fighting World War I. I'm gonna read some of it here. Whoever, for the purpose of\nobtaining information respective to states or to the advantage\nof any foreign nation or otherwise obtains\ninformation, concealing defense, (overlapping voices) Navy yard submarine base fueling\nstation, torpedo station, dockyard, canal, railroad,\narsenal, factory, mine. Holy smokes, I could keep going. This law was meant to punish people who were government employees\nor members of the military who had government secrets\nand went and gave them to another nation that then\nhurt the United States, basically spies, espionage. That's what it's about, espionage. Chelsea Manning violated this because she was a member of the military. She had a security clearance. She violated that security clearance by using her privileged information and therefore broke this law. But Julian Assange is not that. He has never worked for the US Government. He's never had a security clearance. He's an Australian hacker and activist. It is very, very rare\nthat the Espionage Act is used against somebody who\nis not a government employee who does not have a security clearance. So what is going on here? How is the US trying to\nuse the Espionage Act against an Australian who\ndidn't leak any information. He published information\nthat was leaked to him. (upbeat music) So bucket two, I'm\ncalling aiding or helping. The US case here uses the\nEspionage Act to say that, indeed, it was Chelsea Manning who\nbroke the law directly. As an Army Intel Analyst. It was her who had access to\nthe secrets she leaked to them. But in US federal law, we\nhave this thing that says that if you aid someone\nin committing a crime, you are punishable, kind of as if you've\nbroken the law yourself. Yep got it right here. Title 18 folks, Crimes\nand Criminal Procedure, Whoever commits an offense\nagainst the United States or aids, abets, counsel's,\ncommands, induces, or procures its commission\nis punishable as a principal. If you helped out, you did it too. So, they used this law\nto say, yeah, Julian, you didn't do the hacking and leaking, but like you helped you aided,\nabetted, counseled, induced, or procured and willingly caused Manning to do this because you\npromised that you were going to publish all this stuff. So, that was sort of like\nincentivizing Chelsea Manning to do this. And that is why you are being punished under the Espionage Act. Wait, this is a giant deal. This is a big deal. This logical chain that was just created. Assange is being charged\nwith aiding Manning, a convicted spy because\nhe published the things that the spy gave to him, okay? File that away for a second. Let's get onto the third bucket in here. The third bucket I'm calling publishing. Counts 15 through 17, and let's just read directly straight here from the indictment. The government says that\nAssange having unauthorized possession of all of these\nreports from Afghanistan and Iraq and the State Department,\net cetera, which again, he had sort of induced\nManning to give to him. They then specifically\nallege that the crime here is that having all of these documents, he then communicated those\ndocuments to the world by publishing them on the internet. Whoa, the crime is publishing. That's the crime counts 15 through 17 are that he published something. (suspenseful music) Okay, we're done with the legal talk here. Let's talk about what this means. Back to our three buckets here. The first one is the least scary to me. Did Assange try to help\nManning hack a password so that he could remain anonymous? Maybe, the facts aren't super\nrobust here, but whatever, if there is evidence for\nthat and he gets convicted, that's five years in prison, okay. It's these other two buckets\nthat used the Espionage Act. Let's that Assange was aiding\nManning because he promised to publish the documents. And then he went further and\ncommitted three more crimes by actually publishing\nthem to all the world on the internet. Let me explain something\nabout journalism really quick, New York Times article about\nIran, doesn't matter, whatever. When you read the international section or the politics section\nof any big newspaper, you will see quotes from\nofficials inside the government or diplomats or whatever, who request to remain anonymous, quote, because of the\nsensitivity of the subject. What this means is some\ngovernment official talked to the reporter at the New York Times and said, \"Hey, I kind\nof wanna remain anonymous \"because I'm not really\nsupposed to be talking \"to you about this but\nI think the information \"that I'm giving you is\nfor the public interest \"and so I'm gonna do it anyway. \"Please don't reveal my name.\" And the New York Times\nis like, okay, cool. And they publish it. That happens every single\nday all of the time. That is one of the most\nimportant aspects of journalism is that a journalist can have\na source who feels protected because they can remain anonymous even if they talk about sensitive\nor classified information. Why? Because in our society, we value the flow of important information for the public even if the government has\ndeemed it to be classified. So according to the indictment from the Department of Justice, any New York Times article that is quoting a government\nofficial who's talking about classified information, if the New York Times\npublishes that, espionage. I mean, that's what they're saying here. In fact tons of the leaks\nthat WikiLeaks published in 2010 and 2011 were also\npublished by Der Spiegel or the New York Times or the Guardian. Oh wait, but Julian\nAssange isn't a journalist. He's not like the New York Times reporter. Those are like technically\nlegitimate journalist. No. Journalist is not a\nlegally defined status. Journalists don't enjoy\nsome upgraded version of free speech. All journalism takes place\nwithin the free speech laws that all of us enjoy. Oh, and I don't really need to say this, but those laws, those protections are really, really important. Free speech is what keeps\nour society transparent. It keeps our government accountable. It is important and it is rare. It's a new thing. Like being able to hold\ngovernments accountable is like kind of a brand new\nthing in human civilization. It's not natural. It's not guaranteed. It can easily go away. So, that is why I'm\nconcerned about this case. Yeah, go ahead. Charge Julian Assange with the conspiracy to hack into a government computer. But as soon as you\nintroduce the Espionage Act into what he did, you\nstart to play with fire. You're setting a precedent\nthat could easily be applied to the journalism that\nwe rely on every day to keep us informed and to keep governments\nand businesses accountable. Oh, and I'm not the only\none who's concerned by this. The Obama Administration also\nworried that pursuing Assange would be dangerous for\nfree speech and journalism. So they didn't do it. It was the Trump Administration\nthat really doubled down and tried to get Assange and charge him. And I mean, are we surprised? So the Biden Administration\nis sort of at a crossroads, like what are they gonna do? Are they gonna push this? Are they gonna try to charge\nJulian Assange with espionage? Well, it turns out they\nare moving ahead trying to get him extradited to the US. Okay, wait, wait, wait. There's been news. We were making this video. We were editing it just\nbecause we're interested in Julian Assange and\nthen news broke that. - A UK judge will rule tonight\non whether WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, should be\nextradited to the United States - Where a judge basically\nsaid that it's totally legal that Assange be sent to\nthe US to face trial. - Where a Judge approved the\nextradition earlier today, - Meaning he's one step\ncloser to being extradited. Now, he will probably appeal this. It'll probably go to the\nhigh court in the UK, but like he's one step closer. - How long could this drag out? - Some time, maybe not so much time. - My whole purpose in making\nthis video was not to defend Julian Assange as a\nperson or even WikiLeaks as an organization. That's not the point. You can make up your mind on that. The thing that I hope\nI've persuaded you though, is that Julian Assange's\nlegal case has ramifications for all of us. If he's sent to the US and he's convicted under the Espionage Act, that\nwill have major ramifications on the future of journalism. I hope that is clear now. So over the coming weeks and months, this case will play out and you know that I will be paying attention to it. And my hope is that you will be too. All right, that's it. That's all I've got for today. This was a really deep dive. We spent a lot of time on\nthis and I hope it was helpful in some way. So thank you all for\nwatching, for being here. Lots more to come. Hopefully videos in the\nfuture that are not as heavy and depressing as this one,\nbut this one's important. So, glad you watched it. Thanks for being here\nand have a wonderful day."

    "captions": "(Skype ringing) - Hey.\n- Hey. - Is that one of those fancy\ncoffee cups that stays warm? - It heats it from the bottom. - [Johnny] That's my friend Cleo who is a newly independent journalist making stuff on YouTube. - An I'm gonna call it \"Huge, if true.\" - There aren't a lot of\njournalists/YouTubers out there, and now that there's another one, I'm gonna ask for her help. Okay, so I wanna show you a map. Do you see this map?\n- Yes. - [Johnny] This is the Congo. It's this giant country in Central Africa that used to be called Zaire. And what's crazy about this\nthat I've never seen before is if you map all of the mines in Congo, it looks like this.\n- Wow. - [Johnny] And all of\nthese are the cobalt mines. - Cobalt?\n- [Johnny] Cobalt. Yes, cobalt, it's a thing that used to not be important at all but it's now very important and that's what I'm sort\nof fixating on right here. These are cobalt mines and 15 of them are run by China. - I know where this is going. - But wait, this isn't another just China moves into Africa story. I've made a video on that. This story feels bigger, like we're going through some shift in how we make and use energy. - We are going to transition\nthis country into the future. - Which means reusing new materials, new materials like cobalt. So the question is, who's gonna control these\nnew valuable minerals in the future and how will they use that control? - Oh, because cobalt is\nin electric car batteries and a bunch of other stuff? - Yes, bingo, electric car batteries, the thing that everyone\nis racing to figure out and make more of. - I mean, look at this chart of the demand for EVs over time, like it's just exploding. So the reason I'm showing you all of this is because you're a technology person, you think about this stuff, and you tend to have a more\nsort of optimistic view than I do on a lot of the future, and I kind of want that perspective here. Because what I see here\nis just another instance of a big superpower, China, racing into an underdeveloped\ncountry to steal its resources so that it can control the supply chain. And, to be honest, I thought the clean energy\nrevolution would look, I don't know, different,\ndifferent than this. (baby crying)\nI wasn't expecting this. - I really do think that it can. I think that there's a world in which there's a green energy revolution that doesn't look like the same old story of all the other fossil fuels and minerals that we've mined before. I don't think it's gonna be easy but I think there are ways to pull it off. - I like her optimism. - Well, let's get into it. I wanna show you what I've\nlearned here on cobalt 'cause I've sort of\nbeen down a rabbit hole on the cobalt China situation. And then I want to have a discussion about what this means\nfor the future of energy. - Let's do it. - [Reporter] The children\nwere mining cobalt in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo, or DRC. - [Reporter] Cobalt is one of the world's most coveted resources. Its value has nearly\ntripled over the past year. - [Reporter] This most\nprecious of minerals is often extracted and sorted by tiny- - [Reporter] The Chinese traders\nhere bought all the cobalt and sold it mainly to one Chinese company. - Okay, hold on one second, I need to thank today's\nsponsor who is NordVPN. A VPN is a tool that allows\nyou to connect to the internet but not through the place that you're at, you can do it through a different country. Why would you want to do this? Well, I use NordVPN when I'm traveling, when I'm in different countries and I want my internet connection to route through the United States so that my email and all my logins don't think I'm someone\nfrom a different country trying to log in to my stuff. But I also use it when\nI'm in the United States and wanna log in via other countries so I can access way more content, way more stuff that I don't\nhave access to in the US but I do if I connect through Britain. NordVPN is a very easy, smooth, quick way of doing all of this. Nord also has a major focus\non security and encryption so that your internet\nconnection is always secure. Oh, and it doesn't cost very much money. There's a link in my description, it's NordVPN.com/JohnnyHarris. Clicking that link supports this channel but it also gets you an exclusive deal. Oh, and if you decide that\nit's not useful to you for any reason, within 30 days you can get\nall of your money back. So go try it out, go see if this can expand\nyour entertainment options, help you connect to the internet\nmore securely, et cetera. Thank you, NordVPN, for\nsponsoring this video. Let's get back to it. So, first let's understand what cobalt is. It's this blue mineral that's\nbecome really important in the past few years. I mean, just look at the\nprice of cobalt since 2010. It's like popped off\nin these last few years because of one thing. - [Reporter] Electric cars\nare expected to double the world's demand for\ncobalt by the year 2025. - I wanna continue to\nexplain cobalt and China and all of that, but first we have to understand the DRC, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This massive country\nin the middle of Africa that honestly should be one of the richest countries on Earth because it is sitting on top\nof so many valuable resources. Unfortunately, this is a place that for centuries has not been able to actually take advantage of this wealth because it has been pillaged by outsiders. Whether that's the people\nbeing literally stolen and shipped across the\nAtlantic as forced labor, or this brutal Belgian king who came in and forced the Congolese people to work, to harvest rubber, or more recently the blood diamond rush. I mean, this place has\nbeen pillaged for years because of its resources. So, here we are in 2022. The new hot commodity is not rubber or diamonds, it's cobalt, this blue mineral that used to be just for making ceramics turn blue, that's what it was used before, but now it has a really useful purpose in the growing world of electric vehicles. - [Reporter] Electric vehicles. - A lot of people love Tesla. - [Reporter] This is\nthe EV sales forecast. - Electric vehicles are the future. - So, I know something about how electric car batteries are made. I kind of know the\nthings that go into them. How did a substance\nthat made ceramics blue end up being so important\nto electric car batteries? - [Johnny] Well, at first,\nlithium is the main ingredient and that was the most important. But as more and more car companies are trying to make their cars go longer and further without exploding, cobalt is this amazing material that helps regulate the heat\nand volatility of an EV. - So cobalt is super important for electric cars to be\nable to go long distances without needing to recharge or exploding? - Absolutely, we're in this phase where every car company is competing on these sort of nuanced\nmarginal improvements, like my car can go 400\nkilometers, mine can go 410, and so cobalt is becoming\nmore and more important for these long range features\nthat are becoming important in this cut-throat competition. It turns out that the Congo has 70% of the world's cobalt. I'm not kidding when I say this\nplace is like resource rich. - You're rich.\n- So this is becoming a bigger and bigger issue, but guess who read the tea\nleaves like 20 years ago and started investing in\ncobalt mines in the Congo? - China.\n- China. Yes, obviously. China. - [Reporter] The Democratic\nRepublic of Congo struck a big deal with Beijing. - [Reporter] Chinese traders\nhere bought all the cobalt and sold it mainly to one Chinese company. - This is where I start to get pessimistic about the whole green energy revolution, and let me tell you why. I made this video a while back about how China has\nbeen rushing into Africa to build up a bunch of infrastructure and to win the hearts of African nations, but also to kind of assert\ncontrol and leverage over them. But as a part of all of this\nChinese investment in Africa, China has been pouring\nloads of money into mines, specifically focusing on the DRC where all these minerals are. And again, this is like the early 2000s. They set up all of these mines and started mining and processing cobalt. - If you look at a chart of EV demand, it goes way up in the 2000s. How did they know, like, why would China show\nup and start mining cobalt if it wasn't particularly valuable yet? - Yeah, and that's a\nreally important question, and the answer just sort of blew my mind. The first one is easy, which is that cobalt became\nuseful for other things, like cellphone batteries\nand things like that, so there already was\nsome decent demand there. But it's also because of\nhow China's economy works. Because China is a communist country where the state and the\neconomy are intertwined, they have different incentives\nthan the capitalist West. Like, in our economy, we have independent corporations who focus on delivering short-term\nprofits to shareholders. In China, they can take longterm bets. They can say, like, in 20 years we think that this is\ngonna be really valuable so we're gonna pour\ntons of money into this because we don't need to\ndeliver profits next quarter, we can deliver profits in 20 years. So it gives them this unique\nability to make big bets that could potentially be huge, and in this case it was\nthe absolute best bet they could have made. - We hit the jackpot here! - So all of this explains\nwhy China controls 15 out of the 19 cobalt mines in the DRC. - Okay, so you got electric\nvehicles demand going up, cobalt is necessary for electric vehicles, and then you've got China\nwith their foresight buying up all of these mines in the Congo to control the supply of cobalt which we're gonna need for EVs. - Yes, that is exactly right. And this gets into the strategy and the geopolitics of all of this. There's this one quote from an expert that Politico interviewed. He says that \"China is not\nprocessing all of that cobalt \"to export it to the United States \"to support your electric\nvehicle revolution. \"They're gonna make cheap cars themselves \"and the best that you can hope for \"is that they'll export\nthose cheap cars to you.\" Like, it's just so clear\nthat they're doing this to control what they see as\na massive burgeoning market that they wanna have a corner\non, and they're doing it. And here we go with why\nI feel so disappointed as I learn about all of this. Here you have China racing to\ncontrol this valuable mineral so that they can have leverage and power as the world transitions\nto cleaner energy. Oh, and not to mention\nthat as China shows up and does all of this cobalt mining, you'll see no regard for worker safety, you'll see super dangerous mines, you'll see children\ndoing back-breaking work, you have people routinely\ndying on the job. And perhaps the biggest\ncontradiction of all is that this is a finite\nresource once again. Oh, and the process of mining\nand refining this stuff is the same old story of\ndeforestation, polluted rivers, and just general exploitation. I mean, I thought the\nsustainable green revolution was going to be like\nclean and just for people. I thought electric cars\nwould actually mean a cleaner way of doing business, like a cleaner future. But instead we're seeing the\nsame old Earth destroying great power resource race that got us here in the first place. - You good?\n- Yeah, my rant is over, I'm sorry, this has\ngotten me really worked up and I'm ready to chill out now. - You need to chill. - When I used to imagine\na clean energy future, I had this image in my head, right, of that moment in every\nsci-fi where they go, like, \"Once we lived in harmony.\" \u266a People lived in harmony \u266a - And there's Wakanda and\nthere's that one Chobani ad where everyone is using technology and living in a beautiful farm. Record scratch, freeze frame, here we are in the real world where right now it totally is the same old story of exploitation and harm to the environment\nin different ways and harm to people. I think one thing that's\nimportant to realize is that when we talk\nabout a cleaner future we're specifically talking about less CO2, and so though it conjures up all of these images of\nclean in other ways, it's on us to do that also. There's nothing about the technology that inherently will bring that about. - Oh dear, what can we do? - We have a few things that we can do. The first is we can change\nthe kinds of batteries that we're using. There's a lot of development\nin new kinds of batteries, one of them is a lithium-iron battery, not a lithium-ion battery,\nthere's an extra R in there. And that battery uses\ndifferent kinds of minerals, it doesn't use any cobalt. That might help this specific example but the reality is that\nmost of these minerals have their own stories of exploitation, so it's not...\n- It's not great. - So here's where I start\nto feel pretty optimistic. There's a big difference between\nfossil fuels and minerals. You're right that the difference\nbetween electric vehicles and gas combustion vehicles is that one uses fossil fuels and the other we're swapping\nup fossil fuels for minerals, but there's a big difference between fossil fuels and minerals, namely fossil fuels are being incinerated every time that we drive. If we're using more\nminerals to power our cars, we also have the opportunity to get a lot better at recycling. This shows how much we already recycle. This is end-of-life recycling\nrates for select metals in electric car batteries. - [Johnny] Hm, oh, so\nwe're already recycling a lot of these materials,\nincluding cobalt, like it's almost 40%. - Yes, and the other thing\nto keep in mind here is you don't need to recycle\nthese minerals and metals in cars themselves. You can have a clean energy future where we're recycling metals and minerals from batteries that store\nwind and solar energy into electric cars that are then re-recycled back out into other forms of storage and batteries. - Interesting, okay, wow, yeah, that is like an optimistic\nview of batteries 'cause it just feels so finite but if the lifespan is\ndramatically higher, that becomes a much more useful and less resource-intensive proposition. - There's also one more possibility, and I think the people will call me a little bit high in the sky here but I'm okay with that. I think it's possible\nthat it may not just be about fixing the problem with cars, but also about fixing the problem of cars. There's a high-tech version of this where self-driving cars, there's some research and speculation that they might reduce the amount of cars that we're using in total. There's also a lower-tech version of this where we just invest\nmore in public transport. That might sound unsexy but\nit really does seem to me like the most promising option. I think also if you zoom out for a second and think about why we\ncare about climate change, yes, we care about animals and we care about the planet itself, but we also care a lot\nabout human suffering. One of the reasons why so many people care about climate change is because it will cause human suffering, it already is. And so if you take this story and you look at the human\nsuffering caused by mining and you then say, oh, we're not gonna try\nand solve this problem, we're just, what, gonna let\nmore climate change happen? We have to solve these\nthings at the same time because both will hurt\nmore people, basically. - Yeah, that's a really good point. I think if there's two major takeaways that I take from your research into this is like, number one, a greener future is not inherently a cleaner, more idealistic, happy future, it's just a less CO2 future, which is like, again, obvious, it's so obvious when you say it like that and make that differentiation, but I had those so deeply bound together. But I think the more important idea is like even though I\nhave a pessimistic view of great power rivalry, there's not an option here. Like, there's no scenario in\nwhich throwing up my hands and being like the world is effed is gonna do anything. And in fact it's the easier\nway out in a lot of ways. And so it's good to know that\nthere is real work being done to try to solve this and that it's not just bound\nto go down the same route. - In my mind, this story\nisn't a cleaner future is just as bad. It's a cleaner future is a cleaner future, with problems that we still have to solve. (gentle music)"

    "captions": "(suspenseful instrumental music) (ground explosions) - There is a war raging, and the world is taking sides but they don't want to get involved with troops and guns. So they're turning to a new weapon, an invisible one, a weapon that is only possible because of our deeply\nconnected world economy. - Sanctions. (speaking foreign languages) - Sanctions. - Sanctions are this thing that just get thrown around like we should all just\nunderstand what they mean but sanctions are a kind of wonky, bureaucratic tool for economic war, and they're not super easy to understand unless you crack them open, and look at the mechanics\nof how they work. and that's what I want to do to today. I wanna explain what\nsanctions actually are what their goal is, and whether or not they actually work. So let's go. - The largest and most severe package. - Of economic sanctions. - That Russia has ever seen. (speaking foreign language) (ominous instrumental music) - Before we dive into this video, I quickly want to pause\nfor a commercial break, and thank today's sponsor who made this video possible.

Thank you BetterHelp for\nsupporting my channel and supporting this video. Let's dive into sanctions. (upbeat instrumental music) In the most literal sense, sanctions are this. A piece of paper. A bunch of lists that governments make. That is what sanctions are. Bureaucratic lists, but this is a weapon of war.\nIt looks a little bit different than the kinds of weapons we're used to seeing in war, but this is a weapon. I am looking at a list of hundreds and hundreds of names. People's names and their addresses as well as their aliases, their birthdays, their tax ID numbers, and anyone else that is also on the list that they might be linked to. Here in the US, this list comes from an office that is focused on thinking about things that come in\nand out of our country. Sanctions are also this. This comes from the white house, and instead of people's names, it has industries and\nproducts like crude oil, and liquified natural gas and coal, and alcoholic beverages, and diamonds and luxury goods. And that is the point here. What sanctions are, is\na giant list of people, and things that are not allowed to come into our country or whatever country is\nwriting the sanction. Oh, and the list includes, the sale of US bank notes like cash. Like you're not allowed to\nsend like a pallet of cash to the Russian government, according to Joe Biden. Okay. But here's where it gets interesting. I want to tell you how all these boring lists of paper that were drafted up in the past few weeks actually translate into economic war. What is happening right now in the global economy. It's totally invisible. It's not like tanks and guns. You can't see it, but\nit's having a huge effect. And I wanna show you what that looks like. (suspenseful instrumental music) The best way to do this\nis to look at Russia before all of these sanctions. You can see that Russia is connected to the world in a lot of different ways. I've color coded them for you. Blue is everything that Russia exports to other countries like oil, gold, coal. Orange is everything\nflowing the other way. Stuff that Russia imports like iPhones from the US or cars from Germany. That's orange. Green is all of the money that needs to flow in and out of Russia to keep things running. That's money that businesses borrow from foreign banks or it's money that the Russian government has put into US dollars or Euros so that they have reserves\nin case they need it. We'll call this the financial stuff. But then there's personal wealth, which we'll put in purple. One of the best parts about being a Russian billionaire is that you can spend\nmillions and millions of dollars on a flat in London or Paris. Or you can buy a yacht that you station in the port in the South of France. Russian billionaires have money and assets all around the world that they use as their global playground. And then of course, there's just regular Russians. People who fly around the world for tourism and business on airlines that are from many different countries. Those airlines fly over Russia in Russian airspace to get to a variety of destinations. So yeah. Russia is connected like we all are to the global economy. We trade, we move around\nand everyone thrives. It's great. But then Russia invades\nUkraine a few weeks ago. - We are coming on the air because the war in Ukraine has begun. (ominous instrumental music) (ground explosion) - \"This is totally unacceptable.\" Says the whole world. We want to retaliate and show Putin that we can't do that. We have to set a precedent that you're not allowed to invade your neighbor, but we can't send troops like we used to in the old days because now we all have these big weapons that could destroy our species. So we can't like start fighting with each other directly. So what do we do? \"I know.\" Says all the angry Western leaders. \"Let's start to mess with all of this. That'll teach 'em.\" Welcome to economic war, which again like I said, starts like this. A bunch of bureaucrats making lists of people and things and vessels that are now not allowed in their country. But the hope is that it\ncreates a domino effect that changes the course of this war. And let me show you how that might look. (suspenseful instrumental music) Okay, so this is Russia happily connected to the global economy. These sanctions target every one of these connections. Like let's just look at imports. One of the first things the EU did was ban their countries from selling luxury goods to Russia. So the EU like, \"Yeah. Like we're pro Ukraine. Like we're drafting up these sanctions to hurt Russian billionaires.\" And then out of nowhere, Italy crops up and is like, \"Yeah, can we get an exemption? Like, can we sell our goods? Because we have like Gucci and Armani, and come on.\" And they actually got an exemption. And then people were like, \"Wait, no. We're not giving you an exemption. Just because you have all\nthese fancy designers. Like come on Italy, get with it.\" And Italy was like, \"Ugh, fine.\" But it wasn't just the EU who started cutting off these connections. Singapore banned their people from selling electronics and computers, and Taiwan where all\nthe microchips are made, banned their companies from selling those microchips to Russia, which is a giant deal because microchips are in everything. (upbeat instrumental music) Hundreds of international companies that were in Russia started to read the tea leaves, and they're like, \"We're out of here.\" Like imagine if McDonald's and Ikea, and Apple all left your city, and then Netflix announced that it no longer is streaming in your country all in the same week. Like this is real punishment. This is what economic war looks like. (upbeat instrumental music) Okay, so that's imports. The same thing starts\nhappening the other way. Russia is a giant exporter of oil and gas, and all sorts of fossil fuels. And so the west trying to inflict punishment on Russia. Bans their countries from importing Russian oil and gas. That is a huge blow to Russia. Like the second biggest exporter of refined and unrefined\npetroleum on earth. The economic war is heating up, and in the middle of all of this, Vladimir Putin gets up and announces that he sees this as an act of war, and that he is putting his nuclear weapons on high alert as a response. (speaking in foreign language) - Like this is real war tactics we're talking about here with real consequences. All right. Let's get to the fun sanctions like watching rich people squirm. (wine splurging) - Oh. - Back to this list\nthat the government made of Russians who they really don't like. (suspenseful instrumental music) Those people now cannot\ntravel to our country, and any country whose list they are on, and any money that they\nhad in our country. Like if they had it in an American bank, it's now frozen. They can't touch it. Like it's totally inaccessible to them. Their yachts and their private jets, if they're in our\njurisdiction can be seized. Everyone on this list is now a target, and there are hundreds of them. In fact, I've been deep in the OFAC sanction list. There are 712 Russians on this list in case you wanted to know. It's all there on the OFAC website. So going through this list, you kind of get curious. You're like, \"Who are these people?\" I now know their birthday\nand their address, and all of their aliases, but like who are they? Are these war criminals? Are they like military\ngenerals or something? Well, no. There's actually\na few categories here. The biggest one is\nprobably Russian lawmakers. There are not 300 of them\nthat are now sanctioned but then you have a bunch of rich Russians who are the heads of defense, energy, and media companies. I see. Make the most powerful\nRussians uncomfortable, and hopefully the will turn against Putin, and get him to stop the war. That's the logic. And then you have this 26-year old Instagram star who's also on the sanctions list. Wait what? Yes. Polina. The daughter of the very rich Foreign Minister of Russia who lives a very fancy life in London. And the UK sees this\nand they're like, \"No. You've got blood on your hands too. Put her on the list.\" And she's on the list. And now she can't travel to London where she has a bunch of money, and she has a big fancy flat, and she's stuck in Russia. She's on the list. This is happening to hundreds of rich Russian people. And like we don't know if all of them are\nconnected to Vladimir Putin. We're just like, \"You're super rich and influential. So we're gonna make your life hard.\" Please change this. Speaking of travel, tons of countries have written sanctions that ban Russian airlines from entering their airspace, and tons of airlines have cut their routes to Russia. So now the flow of people, just human beings, tourists, and business travelers has come to a screeching halt. Okay. Finally, the last category is big money. This is actually like\nthe hardest one to see, and understand, but maybe the biggest and most important. You have to understand that the Russian government holds on to tons of\nreserves in other currencies like Dollars and Euros and British Pounds. They do this because if their currency, the Rubles, falls, they can take their\nDollars and buy a bunch of Rubles and raise the price back up, and stabilize it. But now all of their foreign reserves, their Euros and Dollars are frozen in like American and like British banks. \u266a You wanna build a snowman \u266a The Russian government\ncan't get their hands on their money in other countries. Okay, but the finance thing gets crazier. Russian banks were then kicked out of the system where banks can send giant amounts of money to each other. It's called SWIFT. They were kicked out. Now, they have to route\nall their big payments through like China, which is like their one\nfriend in all of this. And one more on the finance piece, regular Russians can't use their credit cards anymore or their debit cards\nbecause Visa, MasterCard, American Express all pulled out of Russia. Like that would suck. So all of this is to say, that Russia went from looking like this to looking like this. Totally isolated. And that was the goal. To isolate Russia from the global economy, and make them feel pressure on all levels. The people, the oligarchs, the government, the military, the hope here is that the rich Russian billionaires who have a lot of influence in politics as well as the people\nwho are now suffering because they can't get\nin on the global economy, they will all look to\nPutin and be like, \"Dude. Enough, we're done.\" So the question is, will it work? Well, it depends on what your definition of work is. In terms of creating economic pain. Yes, it's already working. I mean look at how hard the Ruble crashed after the war started. Because remember, the government can't get\nits hands on all of its foreign reserves to help stabilize their currency. The Moscow Stock Exchange\nclosed down for weeks. The economy is shrinking. There is scarcity in Russia. But for me, the definition of will this work, is will this change Vladimir Putin's mind to get him to stop\nfighting this stupid war? And that's a question I do not know the answer to because sanctions are\nnot like normal weapons. We've had guns and missiles and bombs for a long time. We know how they work. We know how they deter people. We know who they hurt but sanctions are not that old, they're as old as our fairly new Global Economic Order. We make these lists and put on these bans for travel and industries\nand financial systems. And we just sort of hope that the ripple effect makes it to Vladimir Putin's brain. But I'm just not sure Putin is a rational actor anymore. And that is the\ncontradiction of sanctions. Is usually we put sanctions on countries like North Korea. These pariah states where the leader is not a rational actor anymore. They're bent on some\nweird ideological vision. They're surrounded by a bunch of yes men. And so sanctions turn into just another narrative that they can use to say, \"We are the victims. We are embattled.\" The rest of the world is at war with us. Plus frankly, Russia still has a way out of some of these sanctions. China is still their ally in this, and China is deeply connected to the world economy. Oh and also, do we really think that Russian billionaires\nare gonna be stopped by a list from a bunch of bureaucrats? These people are well-resourced. They're gonna find ways to get around the sanctions whether it's shell companies or middleman or whatever. It's just gonna be a\nlittle less convenient for them. So in the end, it's the Russian people\nwho are gonna suffer the most here. Well, that is after the real victims of this whole thing, the Ukrainian people who have had country senselessly stolen from them. (soft instrumental music)"

    "video_id": "mqxgP8WlxJQ",
    "captions": "- I've been deep in these documents, each of which is a piece of evidence that helps me piece together a very important question,\nwhich is who got rich off this 20 year bore that\nwe fought in Afghanistan? (bombs exploding) (guns hosts) (people screaming) But first, let me tell you what happened on August 15th, 2021. The Taliban had entered Kabul after taking over the entire country of Afghanistan. The war ended as it had begun with the Taliban in power once again. You probably remember the scenes from the Kabul airport, total chaos as Afghans\ntried to flee their country. But there's one guy who\nsaw a business opportunity in all of this. This guy, Eric Prince, generously offered to help charter a plane to\nevacuate people from Kabul, the price tag, $6,500 per person. That was the market price\nthat Eric Prince decided. But this wasn't the first\ntime Eric Prince used the war in Afghanistan to get rich. In fact, this was one of\nthe last of many instances where this guy profited off the Afghan war and some of the ways he did\nit were kind of messed up. So after digging through\nthe numbers, the reports, the Senate hearings, all of it, we've established a list\nof some of the top people who got crazy stupid rich\noff of the war in Afghanistan - On my orders, the United\nStates military has begun strikes against Al-Qaeda\nterrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. (disconcerting music) - Before we get into our list I want to talk about\nan important term here which is government contractor. - $300 hundred million\nin government contracts. - U.S. defense contractor. - Our broken system of\ngovernment contractor. - [Narrator] At U.S. Federal\nContractor Registration, we know that a government\ncontract is worth more than the dollars awarded. - Here in the United States we love the free market. (eerie music) - I'm talking about this. - So instead of having the\nclunky old federal government take care of all things war, we hire a lot of private\ncompanies to do it for us. This is companies that make our weapons, feed our soldiers, build\nour bases, fuel our tanks and literally fight our wars. (bomb explosion) (gun shots) Yes, we have private armies that we call security companies that basically are soldiers for hire. What this allows the government to do is post a job out there. Like we need someone to\nbuild a road in Afghanistan. And in theory, what happens is a bunch of private companies come\ntogether and they all bid on how much it would\ncost to build this road. And whatever company gives the best price is chosen to go build that road. It's supposed to help the\ngovernment get the best price. Okay, so where am I going with this? What I want you to\nunderstand is that there is this bidding process\nfor private companies to go do things that the government needs, but in war time a lot of\nthose processes of bidding go out the window because\nwe're in war time. So it's like an emergency. So instead you get a lot of situations where there\nis no bidding on contracts. The government needs something done in Afghanistan really quickly. This company could do it. Name your price. We'll give you whatever you need. - [Narrator] As a client, the U.S. government is guaranteed to have the funds to pay you\nand will always pay you. And it's that very process that allowed people to take advantage of a system to let billions\nand billions of unaccounted for dollars be poured\ninto private companies. All of this contributed to what a former Secretary of Defense call a culture of endless money inside the Pentagon. Okay, wait, before we go on,\nI need to thank the sponsor of today's video, which is better help. I've said this a bunch. I'm gonna keep saying it which is that I'm a giant\nsupporter of therapy. I think therapy is something\nthat is stigmatized. And specifically for me, maybe it's 'cause I\nwas a guy or something. I don't know, but I never got messaging that I was supposed to go to therapy, but I've been going to therapy\nfor two and a half years now. And it has truly changed my life. Better help is a service\nthat tries to make therapy more accessible by connecting you, if you want therapy, to a network of over 10,000 professionals and this isn't like a crisis\nline or a self help program. This is real licensed\ntherapist giving you therapy done securely over the internet. If you've ever looked for a therapist, you know that it's really hard. And the thing I respect\nmost about better help. And the reason why I\nsupport what they're doing is because they're trying to make that an easier thing to\nconnect with a therapist. If you don't like the therapist you find, you can easily switch to a new\none, very easily, for free. And Better Help allows you to\nconnect with your therapists in between your sessions\nto get a timely response for whatever you're going through. So I'm a giant fan of Better Help. I appreciate them sponsoring this video. They're giving you 10%\noff your first month, if you want to try it out. There's a link in my description. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel and gets you started on what\ncould be a life changing thing. I really, really, really support therapy. So check it out. Thank you better help for\nsupporting this video, for supporting my channel. Let's dive back into the video. Okay, now that we understand\ngovernment contractors, let's get to this list\nof people who got rich. (eerie music) First up is Robert Stevens, the former CEO of a company\ncalled Lockheed Martin. It's a company that manufactures like this helicopter, the Black Hawk, they manufacture missiles,\nfighter jets, bombs. They manufacture a lot of\nstuff that we use in war. This company gets a lot of\nbusiness from the Pentagon. Like in 2020 alone, this company got $75 billion worth of Pentagon contracts. I know that like when we get into billions it's really hard to like,\nknow what that actually means, but just to put it in perspective the entire budget of our foreign ministry the State Department totaled $44 billion for the entire state department,\nall of our diplomacy, $44 billion and Lockheed\nMartin alone, this one company, got almost double that\nto make our weapons. 90% of Lockheed's revenue comes from the federal government. Their core business, the thing that keeps them\nafloat is war and security. So Robert Stevens became the CEO in 2004. This was three years into\nthe war in Afghanistan. And as the war intensified,\nso did Robert's wallet. And I know this because this\nis a public company and all of the compensation for\nexecutives is public knowledge to all of us. You may have to dig through\nsome boring documents like the Lockheed Martin\nproxy statements from the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders\non April 27th, 2000, but you can find it. So let's see how Robert\nand his war business did in the two thousands. So before the war in the late nineties, the CEO of Lockheed Martin was making around $2 million a year, if you include his salary and bonus. $2 million bucks, it's a\npretty good compensation. Okay, but then the war started. Lockheed started to\nget a ton of contracts, started making more weapons\nand look what happens to the CEO's compensation. His salary stays about the\nsame, just over a million bucks but his bonus now jumps\nup to $3.2 million. Bringing his total compensation\nto around $5 million. This guy's making $5 million bucks. War's doing pretty good for him. Not bad. Let's jump one year later, it's now 2006. (bombs exploding) (gun shots) And Robert Stevens, the\nCEO of Lockheed Martin brought in $18 million. Wait what? From $2 million to $5\nmillion to $18 million. Whoa. Robert Stevens is doing pretty darn good. Okay, but let's keep going. The year after that Robert Stevens brings in $30 million in his compensation. $30 million, sorry, $31 million. $31 million, non equity\nincentive plan compensation, $8 million. Holy smokes. What? $30 million in compensation. I mean, if we were to like graph that, the war starts here, we're looking at something\nlike this, this and this. The war was a life changing\nevent for Robert Stevens, the CEO of Lockheed Martin. Okay, so that's our first\nguy who got super rich. Let's move on to the next one. (mysterious music) A guy named Stephen Orenstein. This guy's company called\nSupreme Group was chosen in 2005 to feed U.S.\ntroops in Afghanistan. To provide all the food. I mean, when this guy got the contract, I'm sure the only thing that happened is that his eyes started\nflashing with money. Since he got the contract, Supreme Foods business increased 50 fold. Over the course of six years the Defense Department\npaid Supreme $5.5 billion to deliver food to the\ntroops, $5.5 billion. And it became 90% of his business. 90% of his company was providing food to troops in Afghanistan. I mean talk about winning the lottery. But remember what I said about emergency funding and contractors? Orenstein realized that he\ncould charge absurd amounts of money for the meals that\nhe was providing to troops. And he knew that no one would notice because they were just\nthrowing money at this war. The government contracts just kept coming, no matter how pricey his meals were. (upbeat joyful music) - There's our beef ravioli. (cash register) - Orenstein was like, dude,\nthere's no adults in the room. Like I'm a child in a\ncandy shop right now. Let's see how far I can take this. (upbeat disco music) Not only was he charging\ninsane prices for meals, but then he started to create\nfake subcontracting companies and started to win contracts\nthat were for nothing. And the Pentagon would just pay him a ton of money for doing no work. And what did he do? He just pocketed the cash. He got super, super rich off of this to the point where he\nbecame a billionaire. He got put on the\nbillionaire list or whatever, but eventually he took it way too far and he got caught and yes, we are now reading a\nSenate hearing from 2013 called contracting to feed\nU.S. troops in Afghanistan. How did the U.S. Defense Department end up in a multi-billion\ndollar billing dispute? I don't recommend you watch\nthis hearing, it's very boring. - DLA had paid Supreme about $3 billion including 1.6 billion for food and water. And 1.4 billion for\ntransportation storage costs. - The numbers being thrown around in this hearing are insane. The Pentagon overpaid nearly a hundred million just\nin like transportation costs which as one congressperson said that is an astounding amount of money. And then to put it in perspective she says that that amount would pay for nearly a hundred thousand children to have access to a head start program which is an early education\nprogram in the U.S. But instead this taxpayer money went into Orenstein's pocket. Nice one, Steven, think of the children. Come on. So what does it look like when someone gets punished for this? Well, here we are in\nthis Senate hearing where the people who gave all of this money without checking where it was\ngoing, are being questioned. And when they asked what happened they say things like this. - The contract management\nefforts that we applied to this did not keep pace with the changes that we were\nseeing in our requirements. - Let me translate that for you. What he was really saying\nis we weren't really paying attention because you know, war. According to this court document, Steven eventually did have\nto pay up $389 million. But let's be honest. He got a little slap on the\nwrist, but the guy got rich off the Afghan war, which\nis why he's on this list. Next up is this guy, Eric Prince. This is the guy we talked\nabout at the beginning, who was like charging $6,000 bucks to fly people out of Afghanistan. - I don't think any human\nbeing who has a heart and soul would support efforts to profit off of people's agony and pain, as they're trying to depart a country and fearing for their lives. - He's an ex Navy seal who\ninherited a bunch of money and decided to start\nhis own private security company called Blackwater. Remember what I said? Private security company\nreally means soldiers for hire. This guy, trained military\nand police forces. In fact, he describes his\nmission for Blackwater as \"trying to do for the\nnational security apparatus what FedEx did for the postal service.\" Privatize, make more efficient, get rid of red tape, etcetera, etcetera. Kind of a scary thought, but okay. He got his first contract in 2000. It was a small contract, $204,000 to help train the Navy\nfor terrorist attacks. Then 9/11 happened. An absolute tragedy for\nthe American people, but an incredible business opportunity for Eric Prince and\nhis FedEx for the army. The U.S. was desperate\nto mobilize their troops for this new kind of warfare. So they turn to Blackwater to help them. The U.S. hired Blackwater to come protect their CIA compounds or to escort VIP diplomats. But wait, let's just get something clear. What are these guys? Are they troops or like military? Technically, no, they're not, but they sure look like troops. I mean, look at these guys but really these guys are just\nlike fancy security guards that the government hires and\ngives them security clearances and sends them to war zones\nso that they can operate like soldiers under the\njurisdiction of a private company. Hmm, but they're just security guards. So they're not like\nmercenaries or anything, right? By 2007, the government\nhad given Blackwater over a billion dollars\nin federal contracts. Let me repeat, this little\ncompany that provides a private security force,\nwent from meager contracts of $200,000 to help train\ntroops, to sending troops abroad to actually be in the war zone and getting a billion dollars worth of taxpayer money within just a few years. As you can imagine, giving\nguns and security clearances to a private army might lead\nto some thorny abuses of power. And in fact, in 2007, the guards\nof Blackwater were in Iraq in addition to Afghanistan, and they opened fire on unarmed civilians. - [Narrator] Indiscriminate shootings by Blackwater guards, leading\nto the deaths of civilians. - In a crowded public square, after a car bomb had exploded a mile away, they killed 17 Iraqis and injured 20 more. Blackwater lost their contracts. It was a huge scandal. It was another instance where\nthere was some accountability. And yet Eric Prince sold the\ncompany and came out on top. Another guy who got really\nrich off the Afghan war. Oh, and those security\nguards who opened fire on innocent civilians\nwere tried and convicted, but then wait for it. They were completely\npardoned by Donald Trump. Do we have any faith in humanity? Next up we've got these two guys. They're nicknamed The War Dogs. There's a movie about\nthem that I haven't seen but I want to. - Sorry, excuse me. - Kind of an emergency. - Sorry, don't worry. I have to go first, I'm American - But really the best thing out there is this Rolling Stone article. (upbeat dance music) These guys were ages 25 and 21 when they started an ammunition company. (gun shot) They bid the pentagon and won $300 million worth of tax payer money in contracts. And they were gonna supply\nthe Afghan National Army with guns in ammunition. I mean, this is insane. These were like early 20 year old kids. One of these guys, David was\njust a few months earlier a massage therapist and then was like, hm, I'm gonna have a\nlittle change of career. I'm gonna go sell $300 million worth of guns and ammunition\nto the federal government so they can fight a war in Afghanistan. These guys got super rich off of this. And soon we're living a fancy\nlife with really nice cars and expensive apartments in like Miami. But what they were doing\nhere was buying ammo from China and then selling\nthat to the U.S. government, which is like a giant\nno-no in arms like trading. They eventually got\ncaught, pleaded guilty. And one of the him was sentenced\nto jail for four years. So this is a rare case\nof like guys got rich and then they got caught and\nthey actually got punished which didn't happen to\nSupreme Food or Eric Prince. The difference is like when\nyou're like a 24 year old kid you don't have a lot\nof money and influence. So you can't like weasel your\nway out of accountability. But what this story shows you\nis just how easy it was to get in on this culture of endless\nmoney within the Pentagon. The massage therapist\nwho had never owned a gun before started an\nammunition and gun company and got $300 million for\nit, just like a gold rush. Okay, so those are the War Dogs. Next up we have this guy, Fahim Hashimy, one of the several Afghan\nnationals who got super rich, part of this group called\nthe 9/11 millionaires. In the early days of the Afghan war there was huge need for\nlocal fixers and translators. The people who got in early, helping out U.S. forces got really savvy to how the U.S. was operating. And they quickly realized that they could provide a\nbunch more local services and make a to ton of money. So Fahim started a business\nthat eventually turned into like a media corporation with like TV stations and\na construction company and even an airline. His company started racking in like $200 million a year\nin government contracts. There were a bunch of\nAfghans who got super rich riding on the coattails of\nall of this money being poured into the country, which\nit's like good for them. Their country's been torn apart by outside superpowers for decades. Let them at least get something\nout of it for heaven's sake. Next up, we have our very own Congress. \u266a Oh say can you see \u266a \u266a By the dawn's early light \u266a Nancy Pelosi and Ted Cruz aren't like arms dealers, but they can still get rich off of war. (bomb exploding) (cash register machine) - [Man] Everything is gone. - [Man] Oh my God. - Because if you're a member of Congress you can buy stocks in defense companies like Lockheed Martin, and a lot of them do. At least 47 members of Congress and their spouses hold\nbetween $2.67 million worth of stocks in top defense companies. Oh, and it's not partisan. Of the 30 house members who hold stock and military contracts 20 are Republican and 16 are Democrats. It's almost split in half. I mean, let's get into the details here. Like which of the congressmen\nhave the most money invested in defense companies? Good question. The winner for this year of who's getting rich\noff war is Kevin Hern, a Republican from Oklahoma who owns over a million dollars in stock from defense contractors. $880,000 alone in Honeywell, which is an aerospace\ncontractor that Congress really seems to love and notice how\nwell their stock has done. Especially since 2009,\nwhen Obama sent a bunch of new troops to Afghanistan. I mean this is a lawmaker who has to give approval when we go to war and he stands to gain if we do, but wait the conflict\nof interest gets worse, when you look at somebody\nlike Senator Gary Peters a democratic Senator from Michigan who is a member of the\nArms Services Committee, which is the committee that authorizes the Pentagon's budget. Here's his financial disclosure. Hmm, he's invested in a lot of things including Raytheon Technology Corporation. Raytheon is a major government contractor for war time things. This guy gives money to the Pentagon to do war\nthings with private contractors and he has invested in\nthe private contractors. In July, this guy's committee voted to increase defense spending by $24 billion, which is more than president\nBiden even proposed. So in very direct terms this guy is voting to put\nmore money in his pocket. That is how our system works. Here's another financial\ndisclosure of a senator who's on a committee that deals with cyber security and protection. She holds stock in six defense companies with most of her money being\ninvested in IT contractor. Do you get it? IT contractor that she is invested in. Cyber security committee that she uses to vote to give money to the thing she's invested in. It's like, come on, ugh. (eerie music) Okay, so that's our list. And let me be clear that this\nis not the exhaustive list of everyone who got rich. There are so many more\npeople who got rich. There are so many more\npeople who abused the system. We will never know their names. We will never hear about them because they didn't get caught. In the end, the Pentagon spent $14\ntrillion, $14 trillion between 30% and 50% of that\nwent to private companies, military contractors, companies\nthat give huge payout, huge compensation to the top leaders. That's like $5 trillion worth of taxpayer money going\nto fatten the pockets of these corporations and for what? What did we get? We now know that it didn't do much for this country and its people. 20 years later the country is falling back to where it started. But what it did do is it made these people really, really, really rich. Good for them. Okay, I'm gonna go try to not be depressed about how our democracy works. See ya. (eerie music)"

    "video_id": "FQ4hvLqNfqo",
    "captions": "[Music] [Applause] foreign why are you doing this why are you fighting this needless war this war of conquest that will topple so many lives he sent his forces his missiles in the middle of the night these are the troops hundreds of thousands of them that had been camped out on the border for months troops that putin had insisted were there for a routine military exercise and that the u.s and uk intel swore were actually preparing to invade many around the world including in ukraine thought that this was just the west being dramatic stoking the tensions but the intel was exactly right most of those troops crossed the border last week and are now inside the country russian military vehicles including tanks entering ukraine the invasion the attack that russia promised would never happen has now started the country is being attacked from all directions hours after this invasion started in the middle of the night on thursday morning ukraine's president zielinski appeared on tv not just to talk to his people but to speak directly to russians themselves we share a border of over 2 000 kilometers and along this border your troops are stationed almost 200 000 soldiers your leaders just approved them to make a step towards us into the territory of another country this step is likely the beginning of a massive war on the european continent russia again warned its nuclear forces were on high alert several cities were hit in residential areas resulting in dozens of civilian deaths this is a war unlike any war the world has ever seen it looks like a war from like 1830 but it's happening in 2022 putin's army is much stronger than ukraine's at least in terms of numbers if he really wants to he probably is going to be able to take over the country's major population centers and oust the ukrainian government the u.s and nato can't send troops for fear of starting a clash between two nuclear nations something we simply do not do it's a red line that no one crosses i want to tell you exactly why vladimir putin and his army are here the story behind this invasion is the story of this one man's worldview but it's also a story of a bet that he took a bet that ukrainians would give up lay down their arms and see the world the way he does but if there's anything i have learned in the past week it's that even if putin conquers a big portion of this country something he has the military hardware to do even if he does that he still won't win this war in fact i'm here to argue that he's already lost there are big explosions taking place in kiev right now people here are going to be waking up to a very different country than the one they went to sleep we are getting this non-stop reports of attacks and russian strikes from all across the country [Music] vladimir putin has already lost this war and to understand what i'm talking about you have to look at two things number one what putin said right before the invasion and number two what actually happened once he invaded i want to show you both [Music] so a few days before the invasion putin gets on tv and addresses the nation [Music] it's this unsurprising hour-long history lecture where putin lays out his grand intricate argument as to why ukraine in fact isn't a real country [Music] instead ukraine was created by the authors of the russian communist revolution 100 years ago and now ukraine this invented country that's just an extension of russia itself has been hijacked by the u.s and europe who have installed neo-nazi thugs to run the show seriously he said all of this you can go watch the hour-long lecture if you want according to his story the west did this to eventually force ukraine into their military alliance called nato which they will use to defeat russia just like and seriously he says this just like hitler did 80 years ago but this time putin will make sure that russia is ready for the invasion oh gosh there is a lot to unpack here the neo-nazi thug thing i will get to that in a second but the message was clear putin was basically like ukraine if you're gonna disavow communist russia and all of the things that it gave to you you don't deserve the land that you got from communist russia and in fact all of this land still belongs to russia and we're going to take it back [Music] but this warped historical framing of who rightfully owns this land isn't quite enough to justify an invasion maybe in like 1860 or something but not today so putin needs to really emphasize the villains in his story so he makes a big part of his story this idea that ukraine this fake country is being run by american-backed anti-russian neo-nazis who are holding the ukrainian people hostages okay okay it's easy to poke fun at like the delusion of vladimir putin but let's talk about the facts here and what putin is actually basing this off of because it really matters for understanding why he went in and why he's gonna lose first let's just clear up the fact that ukraine wasn't invented by russia kiev the capital of ukraine was a thriving city long before moscow was even on the map ukraine has a very old culture but what putin has done is twisted modern history to make a claim that ukraine actually isn't a legitimate country and he does this because it's a very key part of his story one that supports the second major argument which is that ukraine is run by neo-nazis who want to exterminate the russian-speaking population so let's get the facts here within ukraine there is indeed a faction of far-right neo-nazis who have a political party and a militia force and this militia force has actually joined the ukrainian army in the past eight years to fight russia back from annexing any more territory in the east of the country you may have remembered that russia took over a big part of ukraine called crimea eight years ago ukrainian forces have set up a perimeter but it's clear that we are completely surrounded by russian forces yeah these neo-nazi fighters sort of nationalist guys came up as a resistance to that and yeah putin's got one thing right these are not good people these are literal neo-nazi white supremacist soldiers that commit all sorts of atrocities and train children in their ideology and fighting tactics [Music] so yeah putin i get it these are bad people neo-nazis we don't like them but putin is claiming that these are the people running the country running ukraine when in fact if you look at the data from the 2019 election in ukraine you'll see that the country's ultra-nationalist far-right coalition gained barely over two percent of the vote and zero seats in the parliament they are a small group of extremely fringe far right fighters that putin has latched on to oh and there's a more obvious bit of data here which is that the ukrainian president is jewish and has family who died in the holocaust ukraine is not run by neo-nazis listen to balance my view on this because i'm in the west and i'm getting all western media i have actually been watching russian state tv to like see what the narrative is on their side and i can tell you that they actually believe that the country is run by nazis it is reminiscent of the practices and methods of nazi germany and we're seeing a full revival of nazism and fascism in ukraine i've tried to dig into this to try to understand like is there more like meat on the bone here no there's not a fringe group of militiamen in the far east are what putin is basing this off of over here in reality land ukraine is a nation of 44 million people with its own culture that is thousands of years old it is a country where fewer and fewer people like russia in fact it's a country that ousted the pro-russian leader in 2014 [Music] the people don't want russia and putin anymore they've moved on but all of these facts are explained away very conveniently by putin's bigger conspiracy which is that it's actually outside forces that are pulling the strings and that the people of ukraine have been brainwashed by the west and yet there is one thing that putin is absolutely right about [Music] these two countries are deeply connected through culture and language and history and exchange a war against ukrainians would not sit well with the russian people and this explains why putin needs to frame the war in a very certain way not an invasion to take over a sovereign nation of russia's brothers and sisters but rather a rescue effort to save the ukrainian people from these aggressive villains who are really controlling the country okay i'm about to jump into the maps and look at how the war is actually playing out and help us understand it but i really really want us to keep in mind putin's story because it really will make everything click so let's just go over it really quickly putin's story is really four things number one ukraine really belongs to russia number two it has been hijacked by the us and europe i.e the west number three the west is controlling ukraine with its neo-nazi puppets also that the west military alliance called nato can use ukraine as a bridge to get to russia who they want to defeat and all of this leads to putin must invade to free ukrainians and protect russia from the west that is it that is the justification that vladimir putin has been building minutes after this second address last week where he laid out all of his justifications in the middle of the night the rockets start flying and the tanks start rolling [Music] and this is how it started what is becoming the most consequential war in europe since world war ii a pretend rescue effort framed as an operation to denotify the country russia comes in from all sides quickly taking over mostly rural areas but slowly moving towards the major cities the country is being attacked from all directions some of those russian troops are heading here to the capital in addition to tanks and troops taking over land russia also starts firing missiles that hit targets all throughout the country this has come out of nowhere who resist oh i tell you what i just heard a big bang right here the invasion the attack that russia promised would never happen has now started people who live in kiev are sleeping in underground subway stations it's the only place they feel safe ukrainians fled to basements to bomb shelters some people are adjusting to this new reality of living in a country now a war hundreds of thousands fled to the borders west of the country looking for safety others are taking trains to the west to get out of the country they are fleeing into neighboring countries like moldova romania and poland at the city's central train station a frantic dash as all of these people tried but wait remember putin's story according to this story after this initial invasion ukrainians were going to wake up from their slumber and welcome him with open arms the neo-nazi president was gonna flee and ukraine would be returned to russia putin becoming the savior of the russian motherland but that is exactly what didn't happen outgunned and outnumbered ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike are mounting a stiff resistance i used to teach maths and physics but two days ago the russian army took control of my town so i signed up to fight every day ukrainians are taking to the streets to fight for their homeland those russian shits come here she says we are ready to greet them we are ready to fight and like fights like hell this is my city this is my land i have to protect it you do not feel they're going to succeed in taking out your administration and your government no way as they will never take the response of ukrainians both military and civilian is where putin's story starts to crumble the entire world is witnessing the determined and brave resistance by the ukrainian army and population i have never seen ukraine said united and as for the president of ukraine the alleged neo-nazi drug addict thug puppet of the west well the u.s actually offered to airlift him out of the country for his own safety instead of taking the offer his response was quote the fight is here i need ammunition not a ride which by the way that quote has been turned into a t-shirt that you can buy on amazon ukrainians are fighting for love of country russians are fighting out of a fear of a dictator in the event of russia opting for escalation ukraine will defend itself he then sent a video around to the country of him in central kiev making it known that he is staying he is fighting so despite being totally outmatched militarily ukrainians are fighting back showing that the outcome of a war is as much determined by the courage and patriotism of the population as it is by the number of missiles and troops that you have [Music] i've been talking to people inside ukraine and seeing this devotion firsthand how is morale right now among you and among the people you're talking to honestly extremely exciting ukrainians aren't letting this conquest happen and in doing so they are turning putin's argument his story on its head and foiling what appears to be his initial strategy for wrangling ukraine back into his sphere of influence one ukrainian i talked to said that there's a waiting list for the ukrainian army our original defense won't accept any more people because it's packed the queues are growing you cannot you even get in right now men volunteering to fight molotov cocktails for those who want to fight but don't have a gun it's a tweet from the ukrainian defense ministry to prepare molotov cocktails to throw at the occupiers well i'm here in order to protect my family my country there is an incredible sense of unity here the morale is very high okay this sounds all positive and it is but this is still war and putin can still conquer a lot of land he can take over major cities install a puppet government and be the new ruler of ukraine he has the military to do it and he seems to have the tolerance for bloodshed he seems to believe in his fantasy story so much that he's gonna keep up this crusade but i'm here to tell you that putin has already lost this war i mean let's play this out so i can show you what i mean let's say putin keeps going he keeps sending troops in and missiles despite all of this resistance he could eventually take over the major population centers including the capital kiev all of this with the same goal that he's had the whole time which is getting the ukrainians to give up and realize that russia is actually the country they want to align with he's also kind of hoping that maybe the ukrainian military will come to their senses and take over the government and negotiate with putin but let's say they never do they probably won't instead they keep doing what they've been doing for the last week resisting defending condemning and broadcasting all of it to the world on the internet so putin has no choice but to drive the government out and install a pro-russian regime in order to do this he's going to need a massive military presence to keep control of these cities and their people it's now costing him tens of billions of dollars and crippling his economy which by the way is only like the size of texas i mean one of the biggest knocks on putin's plan is the sheer size of ukraine let's zoom out and realize that ukraine is huge it's the biggest country in europe if you don't count russia the giant country that extends into asia occupying this entire land mass would be basically impossible for russia so you have a map that maybe looks something like this which gives plenty of space for ukrainians to gather and mount their resistance giving russia hell for an indefinite period of time meanwhile back home in russia they've now seen the imagery from the ground they now see that putin's story justifying this invasion is total bs there's no nazis there's no brainwashing of the people instead in this scenario russians are thinking of deaths of our ukrainian brothers and sisters while also destroying the russian economy almost every russian has someone from ukraine either a friend or a relative or a colleague this is a war between brother nations protesters in the streets demonstrating against vladimir putin's invasion of ukraine on top of all of that the rich russian business guys who keep putin in power the oligarchs they aren't happy because the entire world has cut russia off russian billionaires moving their yachts scrambling their jets and shifting their assets to prepare for a possible crackdown they can't access their financial reserves their ability to move money is made much more difficult people aren't letting their trade vessels into ports new efforts by u.s law enforcement to make russian oligarchs feel the pain of putin's war i mean this is effectively what sanctions do so the oligarchs are now like dude putin wtf and they put pressure on him to stop this madness but even still putin has enough power that he could still dig in his heels and keep trying to get ukrainians to come under his rule but by this point ukrainians are done with putin they see his true colors anyone who was on the fence before has now witnessed civilians being killed in putin's war of choice they won't come on his side now the upshot here is that there's not really a scenario where putin keeps going and gets what he wants and that's because the story that he based this invasion off of is proving to be totally wrong all of these assumptions that he predicated his war on turned out to be the delusions of a pseudo-history buff stuck in the logic of the cold war not the realities on the ground today at another point to the against putin camp meanwhile putin's war has united the west and nato like never before nato has a new sense of purpose a new thing to rally around something they've been looking for since the end of the cold war and ukraine who is currently getting tons of support and weapons and money and aid and refugee support from nato countries is now way more likely to sympathize with the west because now they've seen the realities of what putin has to offer which is falsehoods and unprovoked conflict all in the name of some ill-defined vision of former imperial glory nope it's my city it's my hometown it's my homeland it's my country and i'm not the one who should live the russians are the ones who should live russia is a great nation full of beautiful culture geography history and people the vast majority of those people don't want imperial style expansion and war they want to live their lives to prosper to connect and yet the warped delusional world view of one greedy man has cut off their ability to do that how is that possible the russian people have no say in the behavior of their government under the putin dictatorship these incredibly brave people often young people in russia who are out on the streets protesting against what their president is doing this is not the war by the people of russia it says yet another military adventure by the unaccountable unelected increasingly deranged dictator in a kremlin by the name of vladimir this situation is developing and certainly will take paths that no one can predict by the time you're watching this i'm sure some key development has happened that i haven't covered here but i feel pretty certain when i say that putin really doesn't have a path to the victory that he set out to achieve last week when he sent people and weapons across his border to attack his neighbors ukrainians with their bold courage have proved him wrong i know that sounds very poetic and maybe even cliche but in this case it's true if someone told me a week ago i would own an assault rifle i would not believe so now the world will stand by and support as they continue to wage this battle for the future of their land land that belongs to them not to a russian dictator [Music] for everyone to know it's our land it's our home we will defend it 13 ukrainian border guards defiantly telling and invading russian warship to go f yourself when asked to surrender and we will win russian ship go [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourself before you go i want to tell you about two things that are important number one i want to give money to the relief effort in ukraine there's a lot of need right now i'm running a fundraiser where i'm going to match donations up to ten thousand dollars information in the description number two i need to thank today's sponsor who made this video

    "title": "What happens if China invades Taiwan?",
    "video_id": "VNZ0so0LCoM",
    "captions": "[Music] in the summer of 1995 china sent a bunch of its troops to the province of fujian they then started testing missiles and putting it on tv they then started running highly publicized combat exercises very similar to what it would look like to cross this 130 kilometer wide strait to invade the island of taiwan a place that china doesn't think is a real country but rather a part of china itself a rebellious island province in an unfinished civil war another round of chinese war games near taiwan has the u.s and other nations concerned china did all this saber-rattling because taiwan's president had asked for a visa to visit the united states and the u.s congress voted to give it to him to find beijing and undermining china's claim to taiwan oh and taiwan was holding their first democratic election these are the first free elections of a chinese leader in 5 000 china announced friday that it would start the new military exercises less than a week before taiwan's presidential election china hated that all of this was happening on this island that they think is theirs hence all of the military flexing but look who shows up next diplomatic trouble may be brewing again between china and the united states it's the us military and they're sending their biggest show of military force in asia since the vietnam war right here in china's neighborhood president bill clinton sent in all of the us's best stuff aircraft carriers guided missile cruisers destroyers powerful weapon systems from the most powerful military on earth so all of this concentrated u.s military power comes into the region and enters right here through the strait of taiwan it was a response to china and all of its efforts to intimidate taiwan the message was very clear china we are way more powerful than you so back off and let taiwan do its thing and guess what it totally worked china backed down and the u.s reasserted itself as the global powerhouse a power that no one can mess with okay so now let's fast forward to last fall a lot has changed in this 20 or so years and china is at it again flexing on taiwan their favorite way of doing this lately is flying military aircraft into this air border taiwan's air defense identification zone or ades an adaz is airspace that if you enter you should identify yourself or else the nearby country will assume that you're coming to attack them china has started flying military aircraft over this airspace without asking permission without identifying themselves not just like once or twice but like dozens of times per day hundreds of times a month these are the actual recorded flight paths of chinese aircraft flying over taiwan's ada's and then back to china it's a giant fu to taiwan or rather remember who's boss here luckily there's some really amazing data on every single one of these chinese flyovers they're all documented taiwan's air force scrambled again today this is research from the foreign policy research institute and it's incredibly useful to see china's activity in taiwan's ages you can see this massive surge late last year in flyovers this is a graph that shows every single time a chinese jet has flown over taiwan's ages in 2021 you can see that it comes to a peak in the first week of october this was the week that china was celebrating its founding and they were sending a very clear message to taiwan you will be ours that week this chinese state-owned publication comes out with this headline time to warn taiwan secessionists and their fomenters war is real this is not fair play so guess who shows up to the region to calm things down a u.s warship has sailed through the taiwan street [Music] so right after this huge bulk of flyovers of taiwan's ages the u.s sends in guided missile destroyers through the taiwanese strait and they're accompanied by a canadian ship worn off 25 chinese aircraft that entered its defense zone oh but this time it didn't work here's when the u.s sailed through the strait and here's what china does after tons more flyovers of taiwan's adas looking at the raw data you can see that these flyovers start happening almost every day it's not the 90s anymore things have changed bill clinton can't just send a bunch of naval ships to the taiwan strait and expect china to back down we're living in a different era the biggest difference is that china's military has become way more powerful in the last 20 years add to that that their zeal for taking over taiwan to reunite it with mainland china has grown immensely every year since the reason i'm telling you this story and showing you the difference between how china reacted in the 90s and how it reacted last fall is because that difference is really important if we want to think about what war looks like in this region i've been talking to military experts i've been diving deep into military reports and writings from the chinese military itself to try to understand what war with taiwan would look like it's something that is becoming more likely year by year so what's to follow is my best attempt at understanding what war in the taiwan strait looks like a war that drags in the united states and its allies war is impossible to predict and so we don't know for sure but what i hope we can do here is look at a scenario and learn how conflict works and what calculations all the countries involved would have to make in what might become the next world war i just want to make china understand that we are not going to step back china's aggression against taiwan is accelerating and it's blaming the u.s raising has been getting increasingly tough on taiwan so are you saying that the united states would come to taiwan's defense yes and yes hey before we dive into this i want to say thank you to the sponsor of today's video who made this video possible thank you nordvpn for supporting this video a vpn is a very useful tool that allows you to connect to the internet but to do so via a different country so when i'm traveling i often want to get into my email and my email doesn't like that i'm in a different country they think i'm a hacker trying to get into my email and it's like no it's me this is one reason i love nordvpn i can connect to nordvpn and tell it to route my connection through the united states so now my email's like oh he's still in the united states he's fine that's one reason i use nordvpn the other is because it allows me to access tons more content there's a lot of stuff whether gaming or like netflix that is not available in my country but if i route it through a different country i get access to a ton more entertainment options which is pretty cool nordvpn also focuses on security and encryption it doesn't throttle your speed so it doesn't like slow your internet down it's a very solid tool for security for entertainment and for travel at least that's how i use it oh and it's super cheap there is a link in my description it's nordvpn.com johnny harris if you go there you can get a two-year plan at a big discount plus a bonus gift which will set you up with a very very good deal and if you discover that this is not useful to you or you don't like it for some reason you have 30 days to get all of your money back so there's no reason why you shouldn't go try it go click this link it supports this channel when you do so and thank you nordvpn for sponsoring this video and now let's dive into this scenario about potential war between taiwan and china [Music] okay i'm going to dive into a very specific scenario of how conflict could escalate in the taiwan strait but first i have to say something i have to get this off my chest which is i felt a little bit conflicted making this video i feel very against the sort of machismo fascination with conflict like it's some sort of cool good thing when at the end of the day what we're talking about are people's lives we were talking about valuable taxpayer money we are talking about the future of entire societies being ripped apart by a power struggle this is not sexy and cool this is a nightmare secondly let us all just acknowledge right now how easy it is to dehumanize china and its leaders and its military but let me just remind you that china doesn't want war they don't want bloodshed they will probably try much less violent ways to try to force taiwan to the negotiating table before resorting to all-out invasion but the reason i want to make a video about the nightmare scenario because even if a military has a goal for a less violent intervention that's not how war works conflict is very messy and one miscalculation can lead to an escalation in the conflict and now you have a wildfire that is out of control on both sides it's incredibly easy for the momentum of conflict to bring us into that kind of situation and that's why i want to suss out what it could look like okay those are my disclaimers let's dive into this [Music] i'm gonna start rolling here i'm just two okay i'm gonna clap here comes okay i need to bring you over to my desk to show you some documents i've been staring at any invasion of taiwan starts with this document this is a chinese law meant to stop any parts of china from seceding from china itself and it mentions taiwan it basically says that if taiwan tries to assert its independence from china or and this is the most important part or if the possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted that china shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect china's sovereignty and territorial integrity translation if they run out of diplomatic solutions china is required by law to invade taiwan and force it to reunite with china and no i don't read or speak mandarin but google translate come on listen we're like 70 years into peaceful solutions being tried and not working meanwhile on the island of taiwan support for any sort of reunification is at an all-time low like it's not looking like peaceful reunification is gonna happen which is making the interpretation of this law more and more on the side of china should do this forcibly okay so that's the legal justification from a chinese perspective pair that with the fact that unlike in the 90s china now has a massive military there's new concern at the pentagon about china's military buildup with all sorts of new missiles china could soon be able to deploy a nuclear-tipped missile that u.s defenses would find much harder to detect tanks helicopters submarines ships i mean this isn't from me this is the us government they recently came out with a report that said that the chinese navy now is bigger than the us's navy at least by numbers they have 360 versus our 297 ships now caveat to that data our ships are much bigger but still china's recent military buildup is nuts and this is why the u.s military is kind of freaking out my opinion is this problem is much closer to us than most think we have to take this on with urgency china is upping the ante on taiwan and there are fresh fears of a chinese invasion of taiwan taking over taiwan remains china's number one strategic priority okay so this is the moment that a lot of you probably came to this video for which is what does the war actually look like let's say that china feels confident that the only way that taiwan is going to join china which is again a legal imperative is if they forcibly invade blockade isn't working negotiation isn't working the first strike on taiwan would likely look like just another chinese provocative aedes flyover china's done this hundreds of times so at this point taiwan thinks that they're just doing another one of their routine flex our military might exercises but this time the fighter jet turns towards the island and begins firing at the same time china fires guided missiles from the mainland and deploys tons more jets and they all start firing in a fast highly coordinated attack the target here is anything that taiwan can use to defend itself like weapons that can shoot down planes or boats that are coming onto the island i mean this could be anything radar communication nodes military command centers navy bases bridges communication networks power stations even government buildings they would have a wide variety of targets to effectively deny taiwan the ability to respond effectively i mean unfortunately for taiwan a lot of these targets are left out in the open they're easy to see a runway is really easy to see and really hard to hide this first attack would happen very quickly one military expert ian easton put it very succinctly when he said assuming the intent is invasion these attacks could be expected to be concentrated in a short time frame as a prelude to invasion with no pauses other than those required for moving reloading and repairing equipment sounds horrible so taiwan's leaders are caught off guard and they immediately retreat underground to a command bunker where they can plan their response luckily china will not be able to take out all of their military targets some of their aircraft hangars are deep in mountains and some of their missile sites are really well camouflaged they would escape the bombardment so taiwan would have the ability to respond they would likely be able to get some air power into the air and fire some missiles towards mainland china to hit air bases radar and military batteries on the mainland at this point taiwan also sends troops to their western beaches to start laying mines and preparing for an oncoming barrage of chinese troops who are probably now on their way across the strait this has all happened within just a few hours and the u.s is just barely hearing about this china has likely jammed much of the communication channels that would allow the us to have a clear picture of what's going on this will slow their response time the thing is china has gotten really good at sending little robots up to satellites in space their civilian satellites to like help repair them they could use the same technology to latch on to an american spy satellite and block its ability to view what's happening on the ground yes we're now talking about conflict in space as a feasible part of the scenario so the u.s is trying to get up to speed the u.s president and military leaders now have to decide how they're going to respond are they going to risk american lives to protect this far away island it's something that the american public broadly would not be into but they have to do something they have to make a plan meanwhile back over in the strait taiwan's military assets are severely damaged and china is now sending hundreds of thousands of troops and loads of supplies across this 130 kilometer stretch of water they're using boats of all kind military boats merchant boats that don't need to defend themselves because taiwan can't respond adequately and each of these vessels is carrying tons of supplies and troops but again on taiwan's western beaches there are probably taiwanese troops who have been planting mines ready for this invasion so there's now a battle on the beaches as chinese amphibious attackers try to hit the beaches and push back the taiwanese defense we're going to continue assuming taiwan doesn't give up and capitulate and surrender to china at this point if that's the case the u.s is now just starting to respond likely from their bases in the region japan and guam they deploy aircraft carriers with jets and bombers stealth fighters as well as fast attack submarines that will focus on one thing hitting all of these ships the ones that are bringing stuff and people across the strait japan and australia likely come in as allies to help out on this defense and now the us and its allies are in direct combat with china two nuclear nations fighting each other this is exactly what we try to avoid because we don't know where it goes from here we don't know where the ceiling is war always escalates and when there's nuclear weapons involved that's a very scary momentum there's even a scenario where china actually strikes first hitting us bases in japan and guam at the same time that they hit their initial targets in taiwan this would be a much more provocative move and would certainly bring the us full force into a war with china so now you have chinese troops who have pushed back the taiwanese defense on the western beaches and they are now moving in towards major city centers the us is fighting on the water and in the air and from here it becomes impossible to predict what could happen next there are so many different directions depending on the us's tolerance for bloodshed there could be american troops on the ground trying to push back chinese advancements inland but if you look at chinese military writings on this you'll see that as a part of this scenario when they're thinking about it they're not just thinking about the us and its allies in taiwan they also predict that india will take advantage of this moment of chaos and invade the himalayan borders to the south they even foresee tibetan freedom fighters way out here in the west who have long been hostile towards chinese rule rising up and taking advantage of the instability to gain back control of their region i mean you can see how this starts to unfold before you know it the entire region is devolving into a war that threatens to engulf many more countries hundreds of thousands of lives and this is where i want to stop because from here it just becomes so speculative as to be completely useless but i tell you this scenario of a potential invasion of taiwan not because it's the most likely it's actually not the more likely situation is china will pressure taiwan through blockades or through other painful pressures that will get them to come to the negotiating table i tell you this because this scenario is still absolutely a possibility what's scary to me about all of this and i've said this a bunch but i'm just gonna keep saying it once something like this starts it's really hard to reverse it to put the cat back in the bag no one's in control that's a concept that's really hard to get your head around if you didn't live through a global war we live in an international system that feels like it has rules we have the un we have treaties and conventions we have global trade it feels like there's some sort of order but let me remind you that that's because we live in the most peaceful time in human history this long piece where few people alive today witnessed what it looks like when two powerful countries clash in all-out war it usually happens when some powerful leader feels strongly that he deserves land that the rest of the world says isn't his so he uses his big powerful army to go take it and in the process he sparks a horrible tragedy and while i hope more than anything that doesn't happen in this case we have to remember how commonplace it is and that the peace between these big powers is actually the outlier here i really hope that we are past needing to resort to this version of conflict to settle our disputes at this time in our history but i'm not totally convinced that we are yet and i think china and taiwan this specific case is the best thing to look at to test whether or not we we can we can talk about it we can find creative ways to solve this instead of resorting to the thing humans have done forever which is just fight each other and see who wins [Music] okay so i appreciate you watching this video and would love to hear your thoughts um i left a bunch of sources down in the description where you can read a lot more about this from the really good research and reporting that has been done on this topic i've got a bunch more videos coming out in the next month so stay tuned and subscribe if you're not already i also have luts and presets which are in the link in my description they are how i color my videos and photo if you are interested in that um i also have a storytelling course where i go into my thoughts on storytelling that is all in the description you can check it out and um that's it thanks for watching i'll see you in the next one"

Russia is setting up field\nhospitals on this border. Like this is what preparation\nfor war looks like. A legitimate war. - Ukrainian troops are\nwatching and waiting, saying they are preparing for a fight. - The U.S. has ordered the\nfamilies of embassy staff to leave Ukraine. Britain has sent all of their\nnon-essential staff home. And now the U.S. is sending\ntons of weapons and munitions to Ukraine's army. And we're even considering deploying our own troops to the region. I mean, this thing is heating up. Meanwhile, Russia and the\nWest have been in Geneva and Brussels trying to talk it out, and sort of getting nowhere. - The message is very clear. Should Russia take\nfurther aggressive actions against Ukraine the costs will be severe and the consequences serious. - It's a scary, grim momentum\nthat is unpredictable. And the chances of miscalculation and escalation are growing. I want to explain what's going on here, but I want to show you\nthat this isn't just typical geopolitical behavior. Stuff that can just be\nexplained on the map. Instead, to understand why\n100,000 troops are camped out on Ukraine's Eastern\nborder, ready for war, you have to understand Russia and how it's been cut down over the ages from the Slavic empire that\ndominated this whole region to then the Soviet Union, which was defeated in the nineties. And what you really\nhave to understand here is how that history is transposed onto the brain of one man. This guy, Vladimir Putin. This is a story about regional domination and struggles between big powers, but really it's the story about what Vladimir Putin really wants. - [Reporter] Russian troops moving swiftly to take control of\nmilitary bases in Crimea. - [Reporter] Russia has amassed\nmore than 100,000 troops and a lot of military hardware at the border with Ukraine.

And BetterHelp is trying to change that, which I really believe in and support. With BetterHelp you can quickly sign up and you take a little quiz and it connects you to a network of thousands and\nthousands of professionals who you can start talking with today. There are a variety of experts in different fields of therapy within BetterHelp's network. So you can find somebody\nwho is right for you. And for me, I didn't have\nany particular specific issue that I was going to therapy for. I just started therapy, and\nI realized that it was just incredibly helpful to\nhave someone to talk to and to learn how to express my feelings and to learn how to talk about what was happening inside of my brain. BetterHelp is not a crisis\nline. It's not self-help. It is licensed, legitimate,\nprofessional therapists who you connect with over\nthe internet, securely. Which is great because\ntherapy is usually really hard to figure out where's the right therapist. How do I get in, how do I book it? All of that is usually very difficult, at least in my experience. And so BetterHelp is making it easier. So if you want to try this out, you can get 10% off your\nfirst month of BetterHelp by going to the link in my description. Thank you, BetterHelp for\nsupporting my channel, for supporting this work. Let's dive back in. Okay. Let's get up to speed\non what's happening here. And I'm just going to quickly\ngive you the highlight version of like the news that's happening, because I want to get into the juicy part, which is like why, the\nroots of all of this. So let's go. A few months ago, Russia started sending more and more troops to this border. It's this massive border\nbetween Ukraine and Russia. They said they were doing\na military exercise, but the rest of the world was like, \"Yeah, we totally believe\nyou Russia. Pshaw.\" This was right before this big meeting where North American\nand European countries were coming together to talk about a lot of different things, like\nthese countries often do in these diplomatic summits. But soon, because of\nRussia's aggressive behavior coming in and setting up 100,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, the entire summit turned\ninto a whole, \"W-T-F Russia, what are you doing on the\nborder of Ukraine,\" meeting. Before the meeting Putin\ncomes out and says, \"Listen, I have some\ndemands for the West.\" And everyone's like, \"Okay,\nRussia, what are your demands? You know, we have like,\nCOVID-19 right now. And like, that's like surging. So like, we don't need your like, bluster about what your demands are.\" And Putin's like, \"No,\nhere's my list of demands.\" Putin's demands for the summit were this: number one, that NATO, which\nis this big military alliance between U.S., Canada, and\nEurope stop expanding, meaning they don't let\nany new members in, okay. So, Russia is like, \"No more\nnew members to your, like, cool military club that I don't like. You can't have any more members.\" Number two, that NATO\nwithdraw all of their troops from anywhere in Eastern Europe. Basically Putin is saying, \"I can veto any military cooperation or troops going between countries that have to do with Eastern Europe, the place that used to\nbe the Soviet Union.\" Okay, and number three, Putin\ndemands that America vow not to protect its\nallies in Eastern Europe with nuclear weapons. \"L-O-L,\" said all of the other countries, \"You're literally nuts, Vladimir Putin. Like these are the most\nridiculous demands, ever.\" But there he is, Putin,\nwith these demands. These very, very aggressive demands. And he sort of is implying\nthat if his demands aren't met, he's going to invade Ukraine. I mean, it doesn't work like this. This is not how\ninternational relations work. You don't just show up and say like, \"I'm not gonna allow other\ncountries to join your alliance because it makes me feel uncomfortable.\" But what I love about this list of demands from Vladimir Putin for this summit is that it gives us a clue on what Vladimir Putin really wants. What he's after here. You read them closely and\nyou can grasp his intentions. But to grasp those intentions you have to understand what NATO is. and what Russia and Ukraine used to be. (dramatic music) Okay, so a while back I made this video about why Russia is so damn big, where I explain how modern day\nRussia started here in Kiev, which is actually modern day Ukraine. In other words, modern\nday Russia, as we know it, has its original roots in Ukraine. These places grew up together and they eventually became a part of the same mega empire\ncalled the Soviet Union. They were deeply intertwined, not just in their history\nand their culture, but also in their economy\nand their politics. So it's after World War II, it's like the '50s, '60s,\n'70s, and NATO was formed, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This was a military alliance\nbetween all of these countries, that was meant to sort\nof deter the Soviet Union from expanding and taking over the world. But as we all know, the Soviet Union, which was Russia and all\nof these other countries, collapsed in 1991. And all of these Soviet republics, including Ukraine, became independent, meaning they were not now a part of one big block of countries anymore. But just because the\nborder's all split up, it doesn't mean that these\ncultural ties actually broke. Like for example, the\nSoviet leader at the time of the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion, this guy, Gorbachev, he was the son of a Ukrainian\nmother and a Russian father. Like he grew up with\nhis mother singing him Ukrainian folk songs. In his mind, Ukraine and\nRussia were like one thing. So there was a major\nreluctance to accept Ukraine as a separate thing from Russia. In so many ways, they are one. There was another Russian at the time who did not accept this new division. This young intelligence\nofficer, Vladimir Putin, who was starting to rise up in the ranks of post-Soviet Russia. There's this amazing quote from 2005 where Putin is giving this\nstate-of-the-union-like address, where Putin declares the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, quote, \"The greatest\ncatastrophe of the 20th century. And as for the Russian people,\nit became a genuine tragedy. Tens of millions of fellow\ncitizens and countrymen found themselves beyond the\nfringes of Russian territory.\" Do you see how he frames this? The Soviet Union were all\none people in his mind. And after it collapsed,\nall of these people who are a part of the\nmotherland were now outside of the fringes or the\nboundaries of Russian territory. First off, fact check. Greatest catastrophe of the 20th century? Like, do you remember what else happened in the 20th century, Vladimir? (ominous music) Putin's worry about the\ncollapse of this one people starts to get way worse\nwhen the West, his enemy, starts showing up to his neighborhood to all these ex-Soviet countries\nthat are now independent. The West starts selling their ideology of democracy and capitalism\nand inviting them to join their military\nalliance called NATO. And guess what? These countries are totally buying it. All these ex-Soviet countries\nare now joining NATO. And some of them, the EU. And Putin is hating this. He's like not only did\nthe Soviet Union divide and all of these people are now outside of the Russia motherland, but now they're being\npersuaded by the West to join their military alliance. This is terrible news. Over the years, this continues to happen, while Putin himself starts to chip away at Russian institutions,\nmaking them weaker and weaker. He's silencing his rivals and he's consolidating power in himself. (triumphant music) And in the past few years, he's effectively silenced\nanyone who can challenge him; any institution, any court, or any political rival\nhave all been silenced. It's been decades since\nthe Soviet Union fell, but as Putin gains more power, he still sees the region through the lens of the old Cold War,\nSoviet, Slavic empire view. He sees this region as one big block that has been torn\napart by outside forces. \"The greatest catastrophe\nof the 20th century.\" And the worst situation of all of these, according to Putin, is Ukraine, which was like the gem\nof the Soviet Union. There was tons of cultural heritage. Again, Russia sort of started in Ukraine, not to mention it was a very populous and industrious, resource-rich place. And over the years Ukraine\nhas been drifting west. It hasn't joined NATO\nyet, but more and more, it's been electing pro-Western presidents. It's been flirting with\nmembership in NATO. It's becoming less and less attached to the Russian heritage\nthat Putin so adores. And more than half of Ukrainians say that they'd be down to join the EU. 64% of them say that it\nwould be cool joining NATO. But Putin can't handle\nthis. He is in total denial. Like an ex-boyfriend who\nhandle his ex-girlfriend starting to date someone else, Putin can't let Ukraine go. He won't let go. So for the past decade, he's been trying to keep the West out and bring Ukraine back into\nthe motherland of Russia. This usually takes the\nform of Putin sending secret soldiers from Russia into Ukraine to help the people in Ukraine\nwho want to like separate from Ukraine and join Russia. It also takes the form of, oh yeah, stealing entire parts\nof Ukraine for Russia. - Russian troops moving\nswiftly to take control of military bases in Crimea. - Like in 2014, Putin just did this. - To what America is officially calling a Russian invasion of Ukraine. - He went down and just\nsnatched this bit of Ukraine and folded it into Russia. So you're starting to\nsee what's going on here. Putin's life's work is\nto salvage what he calls the greatest catastrophe\nof the 20th century, the division and the separation of the Soviet republics from Russia. So let's get to present day. It's 2022. Putin is at it again. And honestly, if you\nreally want to understand the mind of Vladimir Putin\nand his whole view on this, you have to read this. \"On the History of Unity of\nRussians and Ukrainians,\" by Vladimir Putin. A blog post that kind of sounds like a ninth grade history essay. In this essay, Vladimir Putin argues that Russia and Ukraine are one people. He calls them essentially\nthe same historical and spiritual space. Kind of beautiful writing, honestly. Anyway, he argues that the division between the two countries is due to quote, \"a deliberate effort by those forces that have always sought\nto undermine our unity.\" And that the formula they\nuse, these outside forces, is a classic one: divide and rule. And then he launches\ninto this super in-depth, like 10-page argument, as to\nevery single historical beat of Ukraine and Russia's history to make this argument that like, this is one people and the\ndivision is totally because of outside powers, i.e. the West. Okay, but listen, there's this moment at the end of the post, that actually kind of hit me in a big way. He says this, \"Just have a\nlook at Austria and Germany, or the U.S. and Canada, how\nthey live next to each other. Close in ethnic composition, culture, and in fact, sharing one language, they remain sovereign states\nwith their own interests, with their own foreign policy. But this does not prevent them from the closest integration\nor allied relations. They have very conditional,\ntransparent borders. And when crossing them\ncitizens feel at home. They create families,\nstudy, work, do business. Incidentally, so do millions\nof those born in Ukraine who now live in Russia. We see them as our own close people.\" I mean, listen, like, I'm not in support of what Putin is doing, but like that, it's like a\npretty solid like analogy. If China suddenly showed\nup and started like coaxing Canada into being\na part of its alliance, I would be a little bit\nlike, \"What's going on here?\" That's what Putin feels. And so I kind of get what he means there. There's a deep heritage and\nconnection between these people. And he's seen that falter and dissolve and he doesn't like it. He clearly genuinely feels a brotherhood and this deep heritage connection with the people of Ukraine. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Putin, I get it. Your essay is compelling there at the end. You're clearly very smart and well-read. But this does not justify\nwhat you've been up to. Okay? It doesn't justify sending\n100,000 troops to the border or sending cyber soldiers to sabotage the Ukrainian government,\nor annexing territory, fueling a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of\npeople in Eastern Ukraine. No. Okay. No matter how much affection\nyou feel for Ukrainian heritage and its connection to\nRussia, this is not okay. Again, it's like the boyfriend who genuinely loves his girlfriend. They had a great relationship, but they broke up and she's\nfree to see whomever she wants. But Putin is not ready to let go. - [Man In Blue Shirt] What\nthe hell's wrong with you? I love you, Jessica. What the hell is wrong with you? Dude, don't fucking touch me. I love you.\n- Worldstar! - What is wrong with you?\n- Just stop! - Putin has constructed\nhis own reality here. One in which Ukraine is\nactually being controlled by shadowy Western forces who are holding the\npeople of Ukraine hostage. And if that he invades,\nit will be a swift victory because Ukrainians will\naccept him with open arms. The great liberator. (triumphant music) Like, this guy's a total romantic. He's a history buff and a romantic. And he has a hill to die on here. And it is liberating the people who have been taken from\nthe Russian motherland. Kind of like the abusive\nboyfriend, who's like, \"She actually really loves me, but it's her annoying friends who were planting all\nthese ideas in her head. That's why she broke up with me.\" And it's like, \"No, dude, she's over you.\" - [Man In Blue Shirt] What\nthe hell is wrong with you? I love you, Jessica. - I mean, maybe this\nvideo should be called Putin is just like your\nabusive ex-boyfriend. - [Man In Blue Shirt] What\nthe hell is wrong with you? I love you, Jessica! - Worldstar!\n- What's wrong with you? - Okay. So where does this leave us? It's 2022, Putin is showing\nup to these meetings in Europe to tell them where he stands. He says, \"NATO, you cannot\nexpand anymore. No new members. And you need to withdraw all your troops from Eastern Europe, my neighborhood.\" He knows these demands\nwill never be accepted because they're ludicrous. But what he's doing is\nshowing a false effort to say, \"Well, we tried to\nnegotiate with the West, but they didn't want to.\" Hence giving a little\nbit more justification to a Russian invasion. So will Russia invade?\nIs there war coming? Maybe; it's impossible to know because it's all inside\nof the head of this guy. But, if I were to make the best argument that war is not coming tomorrow, I would look at a few things. Number one, war in Ukraine\nwould be incredibly costly for Vladimir Putin. Russia has a far superior\narmy to Ukraine's, but still, Ukraine has a very good army that is supported by the West and would give Putin a\npretty bad bloody nose in any invasion. Controlling territory in\nUkraine would be very hard. Ukraine is a giant country. They would fight back\nand it would be very hard to actually conquer and\ntake over territory. Another major point here is\nthat if Russia invades Ukraine, this gives NATO new purpose. If you remember, NATO was\ncreated because of the Cold War, because the Soviet Union\nwas big and nuclear powered. Once the Soviet Union fell, NATO sort of has been\nlooking for a new purpose over the past couple of decades. If Russia invades Ukraine, NATO suddenly has a brand\nnew purpose to unite and to invest in becoming\nmore powerful than ever. Putin knows that. And it would be very bad news\nfor him if that happened. But most importantly,\nperhaps the easiest clue for me to believe that\nwar isn't coming tomorrow is the Russian propaganda machine is not preparing the Russian\npeople for an invasion. In 2014, when Russia was about to invade and take over Crimea,\nthis part of Ukraine, there was a barrage of state propaganda that prepared the Russian people that this was a justified attack. So when it happened, it wasn't a surprise and it felt very normal. That isn't happening right now in Russia. At least for now. It may\nstart happening tomorrow. But for now, I think Putin\nis showing up to the border, flexing his muscles and showing\nthe West that he is earnest. I'm not sure that he's\ngoing to invade tomorrow, but he very well could. I mean, read the guy's blog post and you'll realize that he\nis a romantic about this. He is incredibly idealistic\nabout the glory days of the Slavic empires, and\nhe wants to get it back. So there is dangerous\nmomentum towards war. And the way war works is even\na small little, like, fight, can turn into the other guy doing something bigger and crazier. And then the other person has to respond with something a little bit bigger. That's called escalation. And there's not really a ceiling to how much that momentum\ncan spin out of control. That is why it's so scary\nwhen two nuclear countries go to war with each other, because there's kind of no ceiling. So yeah, it's dangerous. This is scary. I'm not sure what happens next here, but the best we can do\nis keep an eye on this. At least for now, we better understand what Putin really wants\nout of all of this. Thanks for watching. (dramatic music) I appreciate everyone for being here. I'm excited for another year of a lot of bigger, more\nambitious videos on this channel. I've been diving really deep. I've been printing a lot of things out and reading them in hard copy, which I really like and\nhighlighting them for these videos, which is really helpful for me and hopefully helpful for you. If you want to support this work, I have a Patreon which\nyou can go check out. There's a link in my description. And then I also am\nselling presets and LUTs for video and photo. It's what I use to color,\nthis screen right now is being colored by a LUT,\nwhich is a color profile that you can put on your\nvideo to make it look pretty. This is what it looks\nlike without the LUT. Hi. And this is what it\nlooks like with the LUT. It's a lot better. And I have quite a few of them\nthat we've been working on for probably over a year and a half with a professional colorist. It's now out and for sale. I also have them for photos as well. Thank you all for being here and I'll see you in the next video."

    "title": "The 3 Strangest Borders on Earth",
    "video_id": "Fp2PcrRNlGo",
    "captions": "- I want to show you three\nborders that are very peculiar. Here they are. (dramatic music) One, two and three. And not just because\nthey look weird on a map, but because of how they look in real life. (dramatic music) Us map nerds love looking at things that look weird on a map. Like this town that is\ncut up by a bunch of Dutch and Belgian enclaves. Looks really weird on\na map, but in reality, the people living here\naren't deeply affected right now by these strange borders. I'm interested in borders\nthat look interesting on a map and that are connected to real\nworld things, real people. There are a lot of these\nout there, trust me, but there are three in particular that I want to talk about today. Three borders that blow my mind and that help us learn about\nhow far countries will go to control land and\nwater, so let's do this. - [Announcer] ISIS continues\nto lose ground in Syria. - [Reporter] Artificial\nislands under construction could become military bases. - [Australian Reporter]\nDeal reached makes the US the only Western country to\nrecognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. (dramatic music) - [Johnny] The first border\nis the Moroccan Berm Wall. Morocco is this country in Northern Africa that claims all of this land, but if you look at Google Maps, you'll see this dashed line and that there's another\ncountry underneath it that isn't Morocco, it's Western Sahara. This dash line is not the\nborder I want to talk about, but let me explain. The line is dashed because Morocco doesn't want all of this to be a country, doesn't want these people\nto have independence. Morocco thinks it's theirs, so since 1975 when Spain left this land, Morocco has been fighting\nto keep the people down here from controlling the land. They took this pretty far. In the 1980s, when they\ngot out the bulldozers and started building a wall, and after a decade of digging, they created the border\nthat I want to talk about. This is what it looks like on a map. - [Reporter] You know Morocco's-- - [Annoucer] Build a wall-- - [Reporter] To 1700 mile Berm\nin occupied Western Sahara. - [Johnny] It is a nearly\n3000 kilometer wall of sand and dirt. I mean, that's a huge, huge wall. This wall is meant to\nkeep the local people who want Western Sahara to be\na free and independent country on this side of the\nline and allows Morocco to occupy the other 80% of\nwhat would be Western Sahara, and that 80%, by the way, is the more resource\nrich part of the country, and it is not just a wall. It is a bunch of Moroccan\ntroops who load it up with weaponry, radar,\nand underground bunkers. Oh, and landmines. Tons and tons of landmines. (dramatic music) This is widely accepted as the longest landmine field on earth. (dramatic music) When I was in Morocco, I learned that it is literally\nillegal to show a map that contains this border or anything that is not this. Many countries don't\nrecognize Morocco's claim to all of this land. In fact, the United States\ndidn't recognize the claim until last year when the\nTrump administration said that they would recognize it in exchange for Morocco becoming\nfriends with Israel again. Sort of a weird love triangle. It's just, it's so weird\nhow this stuff works. It's like, you're not real,\nbut if you like my friend, you're real now. Meanwhile, the people who live\nhere in this little strip, they run their own country, but it's under the militant\neye of the Moroccan military who patrol this wall to keep them out of the rest of their country. These locals have been in\na decades long struggle to fight for the day\nwhen they can break down this sand barrier and actually\nbuild their own country. But the powers that be\naren't letting that happen anytime soon. Okay, okay, so that is\nthe Moroccan Berm Wall, 3000 kilometers of sand and dirt. Crazy. Next up, let's go over to Syria. (dramatic music) Sometimes borders can embody\nhistory, religion, energy, dictators, and modern day\nguerrilla warfare all in one, and that's what's happening\nover here in Syria. (dramatic music) Okay, wait, before we get into this, we need to pause and I need\nto thank today's sponsor who allows me to make these videos. Thank you NordVPN for\nsponsoring this video. Okay, so if you don't know what a VPN is, it is a thing that allows you\nto connect to a secure server sometimes outside of your country so that you can browse the\ninternet anonymously and securely and from whatever country you want. I use this all of the time,\nespecially when I'm traveling. NordVPN is like an industry\nleader in the VPN space. They have a very good product\nthat allows you to go in, choose the country you\nwant to connect from, and quickly have a secure,\nanonymous connection to the internet. You can connect up to six devices and on every major platform,\nWindows, Android, iOS, Mac, Linux, et cetera. You could even do this\non like an Android TV. I use Nord VPN for two reasons. Number one is because when I'm traveling, I'm often connecting to a\nwifi router inside of like a coffee shop or like a public area. With a VPN, you can do this more securely, and when I'm traveling my\ncomputer kind of freaks out and thinks that like, I'm someone else so I get kicked out of my Gmail, I can't watch like the\nNetflix shows I'm used to. With NordVPN, I can just\nconnect to an American server, and now, as far as my computer\nknows, I'm still in the US. I have access to all my favorite content. I can choose from over 5,000 servers in 60 different countries and\nall of this is lightning fast so you don't notice any difference. It is an incredibly helpful service. You don't have to take my word for it. There's a link in my description. When you go click that link, you will get a really good\nprice on a two year plan that you can get your money\nback if you don't like after 30 days. Plus this comes with a huge discount, so that link is in my description. It is NordVPN.com/JohnnyHarris. Thank you NordVPN for sponsoring\nmy video and my channel and allowing me to do this work. We are now ready to get back to the maps. Let's go to Syria. (dramatic music) Okay, so we're in this part\nof the world, the Middle East. We have Syria, and up\nhere, you have Turkey. There's this one really\nfamous guy in Turkey. He was like the grandpa of the guy who started Turkey's big\nempire the Ottoman Empire. Anyway, this guy may or may\nnot have died by drowning in the Euphrates river, like right here, and so to honor him,\nthey decided to bury him right on the banks of the Euphrates River, right here on this like\nreally famous hill. Sort of seems like an interesting decision to bury the person like right\non the banks of the river that killed them. Anyway, not my decision. They buried him on this famous hill, and this again was like a long time ago. This was back when this region\nwas just one big empire, it was Turkey's big Ottoman Empire. But of course the Europeans\nwouldn't let this last for long, so they show up in the early 1900s and they cut this region up. Like they literally like divvy it up, it's like you Britain, you get this part, France, you get this part, Russia, you get this little bit up here, Italy, you get this bit over here. Like they just like cut the lines up. It's just, it's madness, and eventually France\ntook their little plot of the Middle East, and like,\nthese are now two countries. We have Turkey up here and\nwe have Syria down here, and they drew this line\nseparating these two countries. \"Wait, wait, wait,\" said the new Turkey, \"The tomb of our really\nimportant guy is like now in the new Syria,\" and France was like, we're\nnot going to redraw the line so like Turkey, you can control this little circle of land where the tomb is. That little bit of land\nis officially Turkey, but we're not going to\nredraw the whole line. Turkey was like, sweet, that works. So it's the 1920s and\nTurkey looks like this, plus this little tiny dot in Syria where the tomb of Suleyman is, and like Turkish guards could\nbe there and guard the tomb, and it was fine. Fast forward 50 years and things\nare going fine at the tomb. Syria is now run by this\ndictator, and he's like, Hey, we want to build a dam\nright here on the Euphrates. You know, hydro electricity. But then Turkey freaks\nout because all they see in all of this is a dam\nthat is going to fill this whole valley full of water, this valley where the hill\nis where their guy is buried is gonna be underwater soon and their special grave could\nsoon be totally destroyed. So what did they do? They move the grave. Meaning they move their\nlittle bit of sovereignty from right here all the way up here, 85 kilometers north, still inside Syria. Why didn't they just move it into Turkey? So this border, this\nlittle conclave of Turkey just moved up. Okay, so now it has a new location. It doesn't stop there,\nso the dam is built, the tomb is safe, there is\nnow a lake called Lake Assad after the dictator. Fast forward another half century, and now the dictator's son is in power, and guess what's happening in Syria? - The Islamic state Now\ncontrols more than half of Syrian territory. This morning that includes some of the most important\ncultural treasures. - The ISIS fighters has now\nentered the archeological ruins. - We're talking the capital of ISIS. - ISIS took over a lot of\nSyria in 2014 and 2015, including where the new Turkish tomb was, where this little speck of Turkey was, and if you don't know anything about ISIS, you should know that in\naddition to being awful in every way, they also love\nto destroy sacred old things. - This morning ISIS\nclaimed to have destroyed priceless pieces of history. - [Reporter] What they didn't\nblow up with explosives, they literally tore apart by hand. - So Turkey is freaking out now. They're like, dude, ISIS is\ngoing to destroy the tomb, so they moved it again. This time, right up to the Turkish border, still in Syria though, but like within a few\nhundred meters of the border. So now you have Turkey, Syria, and a little bit of Turkey in Syria. There's this clip of the\nprime minister of Turkey visiting the newly moved tomb. He prays to it and then as he walks out, you get a little reminder\nthat this dot on the map is still a border. It still has borders. These fences separate this prime minister from Turkish sovereign\nterritory on one side, and then a fence, and then\nSyria, where all these kids are. No, but seriously, like why\ndidn't they move it into Turkey? Like if you're going\nto move it all that way for the second time, like, just move the thing into Turkey\nwhere it's not surrounded by a country that is\ndevolving into a civil war. You know what I think it is? I think it's that Turkey is like one of the few big, powerful countries that doesn't have an exclave meaning a little island of themselves in a different country. I think they literally just\nwant to be like, oh yeah, we have one of those. Like, we've got one of those\nweird things on the map. It's 200 meters off our\nborder, but like, we have it. We can move it whenever\nwe want, but whatever. That is how this sacred site exclave border thing moved around, and eventually it's supposed to move back to its second location,\nbut the details are fuzzy on how that's going to happen. Okay, so that's Turkey and Syria, let's go to our final border, which has to do with the ocean. (dramatic music) - [Reporter] China's military buildup has angered the Obama administration. - [Johnny] So we're over\nhere in Southeast Asia, just under China. This body of water, the South China sea. This place is home to vital trade routes, tons of oil and gas, tons of\nfish, strategic military posts. I mean, this sea has it all, which is why everybody wants it. Look at all of these lines. These are the claims from all\nof these different countries on the South China sea. It's like a total nightmare, right? Okay, okay, hold on. Let's unpack all of these. First let's remember that every country that borders an ocean\ngets 200 nautical miles into the ocean to be\ntheir economic waters, where they can fish and mine and whatever. That's their economic waters. So that's how you get\na lot of these borders. So like Vietnam by default\ncan have all of this water. It's their exclusive\neconomic zone, their EEZ. Malaysia's looks like this, and if you're going to claim\nany more water than this default EEZ, you sort of have\nto like justify yourself. You have to be like, we\nclaim more than our EEZ because X, Y, and Z. So yeah, it's looking a little bit messy, but then wait till China, the\nbig dog in the neighborhood, swoops in and says the UN, Shmoo-N, I'm not into the UN and whatever. We've been here for like\n5,000 years on these waters. Our claim to this ocean is this. Like, they literally didn't do any sort of scientific claim here. It was literally guy with\nmap draws a dashed line through 90% of the South China sea, and is like, this is China's. And everyone's like, whoa,\nhow, how does that make sense? And they're like, 'cause\nwe're freaking China. And everyone's like, okay? And that is how you get\nthis, a total mess of lines, and it's not just in the water. There are islands down here. Like this set of islands\ndown here is claimed by like five countries. So yeah, there's international\nlaw for this stuff, but in reality, it's a total free for all, and guess who's winning\nin the free for all. You guessed it. (dramatic music) China's not waiting for a\ndiplomatic solution here. What they do instead is just\nlike show up to these islands and build military bases\nand landing strips, but then there's big parts\nof this body of water that have no islands\nso what does China do? They show up and dig up a bunch\nof sand from under the ocean and build islands and\nthen build military bases and landing strips. Like, look at these boats. These boats are making islands. They've created 1300\nacres worth of new land in the South China Sea. - [Announcer] Overall China\nis adding to its islands at the rate of at least\nthree and a half acres a day. - And they populate it\nwith military assets. Okay so that's what it\nlooks like on a map. It's wild. So as always, we have the lines on the map that look a certain way, but then the facts on the ground often say something totally different. This whole sea is controlled by China. In addition to building islands, they also will chase down fishermen from like the Philippines and Vietnam who are fishing in their\nown waters, totally legal, and they will show up\nand just attack them. They'll capture them,\nthey'll intimidate them, and they'll make sure\nthat they know who's boss, and no one can really\ndo anything about it. So all these lines can look all\ncomplicated, but in reality, it's pretty simple what\nit should look like. (dramatic music) Okay, those are my three borders. There are so many of these examples. These are the ones that are most peculiar and strange to me right now. So thank you for watching. It is the end of the year, end of 2021. It's been a fun, intense\nyear, made a lot of videos, and I also made a bunch of luts and presets, which you don't know what that is, it's how I color my videos\nwithout a lut on me right now, this video would look\nlike this, but with a lut, it looks like this. Me and Iz collaborated on this and found - [Iz] A professional colorist. - With a professional colorist to find a set of luts for video\nand presets for photos that really reflect the color that we love to put on our photos and video. Literally years in the making\nand they finally exist, so that's a thing. I also made a storytelling\ncourse with Nathaniel Drew. That is live on Break Trip right now. It is everything Nathaniel Drew and I know about storytelling packed\ninto one jam packed course that again, I've been\nworking on for years. So that is also in the description. What else do I plug in these moments? Oh, I have an orange jacket pen. That's kind of fun. Izzie's doing a house series someday. (Iz mumbling sadly) You sound really sad. (\"In the Arms of an Angel\" plays) Izzie's doing a house\nseries on our new house that we're building that's\ntaken a year and a half so far. Okay, I should probably wrap this up. Thank you all for being here. Happy new year and I will see you in 2021. I will see you in 2022 with a set of really, really cool videos that I'm working on so bye everyone! (upbeat music)"

    "captions": "- I want to show you something that to me is quite bizarre. It's a tweet sent by the\nMayor of Miami, Florida. Francis Suarez saying\nthat he wants to take his next paycheck 100% in Bitcoin. But wait, scroll down\nand look at the replies. And there's this guy, Eric Adams saying that he wants to take\nhis next three paychecks in Bitcoin. Oh and by the way, if you\ndon't recognize this guy, it's because he was just elected as the Mayor of New York City. - [Announcer] The Mayor of the people. - These are major politicians here and they are very publicly\npromoting cryptocurrencies. I feel like I can't go 10\nminutes on the Internet without running into some\nBitcoin this, Ethereum that, or hearing about some young dude becoming really rich from\nsome dog-related meme money. (dog barking) I'm sure you've noticed this, too, if you spend any time on the Internet. Maybe you've been avoiding\nit, kind of like I have, because I don't know the\nvibes are just kind of off. - Thank you, Michael. Call me the doge father. - That's weird. It's really weird. - But there's no avoiding this. 2021 is the year that crypto\nwent full blown mainstream. - We've seen the price of Bitcoin double. - Just right now I've\nmade an extra 200 dollars. - El Salvador became the first country in the world on Tuesday to\nmake Bitcoin legal tender. (man speaking Spanish) - The whole thing is a joke. - [Man] Even the Flintstones\nnew about the crypto. - How can you make a sense of this? - [Announcer] Dogecoin\nis the people's crypto. - Just became a Dogecoin millionaire. - The big story this morning. Staples Center getting a name change. - It's soon going to be\nknown as Crypto.com Arena. - [Man] There's a spike\nin crypto currency scam. - Non fungible tokens, they're taking over the art world. - Your work's sold for $69 million. - Sold. - So the hustle. - This movement started as\na small ideological project before eventually attracting\nhoards of scams and gamblers. And now it's been embraced by Wall Street and Silicon Valley. The question we all\nneed to be asking is not how does the blockchain work, and what's the technology\nthat underpins all of this. What you need to be asking is is this takeover a good thing, because that's a really\ncomplicated question. - Hold on. Yes, it is a great thing. - Okay. - Actually, this is not good. This is very bad. - It's bad? Wait, hold on a second. I don't do these types of videos where I do like this sort\nof debate myself thing. That's not what I do. Why are we doing this? - Well, you do now. - Okay, I'll let you to work this out and debate the pros and cons of crypto. But I just want to say\none last thing here, which is that this space\nis really hard to navigate for anyone looking for good information. Most of the commentary around crypto comes from people who have\na direct financial stake in getting more people to\nbuy their coin of choice. There's a lot of motivated\nreasoning that can happen when your money is on the line. So with that, I'm just going to sit back and enjoy the show. (bell ringing) Okay, wait, everyone\npause just for a second because I need to thank today's sponsor because that's literally my job. That's how I pay my bills. So I'm going to do that now. And then we can get back to it. The sponsor of today's\nvideo is Betterhelp. Here's the fact of the matter, finding a therapist is really hard. I went through the\nprocess for several years, trying to find a good therapist by calling doctor's offices\nand sitting in waiting rooms and trying to see if they've\nlined up with my insurance. Betterhelp is a platform\nthat attempts to make this a much easier, smoother process. What you do is you go on, you fill out your information\nand they match you with a licensed professional therapist. You can start communicating\nwith somebody within 48 hours. It is not a crisis line\nor a self-help thing. It is professional therapy\nthat is done on the Internet. There's a broad range of expertise. There's a huge network of\ntherapists so that you can choose from people who might not be\navailable to you in your city, but are on this network and\nare just in a different place. And they make it easy to\nchange therapists if needed. It takes a moment to find\na good therapist sometimes and they make it easy to change. All of this is to say that\nI'm a major fan of therapy generally. I think that therapy\nis way too stigmatized and not accessible enough in our society. And it should be. It has changed my life. And I think that everyone\nshould try to get therapy. Betterhelp is a platform that is trying to make it more affordable\nthan the traditional slog of going and trying to find a therapist. So if you want to try this out, you can get 10% off your first month. If you go to the link in my description, it's betterhelp.com/Johnnyharris. You get 10% off. You can try it out, see\nif it works for you. Thank you, Betterhelp for\nsponsoring this video. Now let's get back to our debate. Go ahead guys. - Okay, let's start out\nwith the most obvious just waste here, which is\nall of the wasted energy. Look at this chart. This chart is the amount\nof electricity it takes to run the Bitcoin network, just Bitcoin, not any other cryptocurrency. Right now, it's almost on par with the electricity consumption of Argentina, a whole country. Why does it take so much energy\nto create Internet money? - Well, let's also be honest. - Great question. It's because the security\nof Bitcoin and Ethereum depend on thousands of computers\nracing to randomly guess a 64-digit number first\nday and night, forever. And when the price of Bitcoin goes up, more computers jump on board,\nwhich is more electricity, which is more climate change. And they work so hard that\nthey wear themselves out and just die after a few years, becoming a pile of useless e-waste, tons of energy, tons of waste. Why are we doing this? - Okay, hold on, hold on. You've been talking for long enough. Let me chime in here. Yes these computers use\na lot of electricity, but not all of that\nelectricity is produced by burning fossil fuels. You'll notice that more and\nmore our electricity is clean. It comes from solar\npanels and wind turbines. There's even this recent survey where they ran around and asked, where do you get your electricity from? And for the crypto miners that responded, 40% of their energy comes from renewables. Crypto mining is also\nwell-suited for grabbing energy that might otherwise be wasted. There's this one oil facility in Utah, where they have to burn\na bunch of natural gas because it's like a by-product\nfrom their oil extraction. So instead of just burning\nthis into the atmosphere, they put a crypto mine\nin a shipping container to use that natural gas as electricity to run their computers. Stuff like this is brilliant. And it's happening all over the place. There's also wind energy\nfrom these big wind turbines. Oftentimes the wind is\nblowing and making electricity at times when humans don't really need it like in the middle of the night. So these crypto computers\nthat are mining cryptocurrency never need to sleep. And so they can ramp up in the night and use this electricity\nthat would have otherwise just gone to waste. And besides why are we singling\nout crypto for using energy? Everything uses energy. The question is whether or not\nthe product merits that use which it does. And let me explain why. - Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not going to explain why, because that's the whole point. You just said it. You're talking about Internet money. That's built off of\nelectricity and fancy math. - I hate math. - The product is useless. It's actually worse than useless. It's actually harmful. Every week some new\ncrypto company gets hacked or runs some scam or claims\nthat their scam was a hack. There's no consumer protection. It's the wild west. And there's a lot of predatory behavior. (gun firing) The most recent example is\nthe Squid Game cryptocurrency. - Investors crying scam\nover a cryptocurrency inspired by the hit\nNetflix show, Squid Game. - Someone decided to make a\ncryptocurrency called Squid. They posted this beautiful\npaper outlining that it was like a play-to-earn online game. It was going to be released next month. They got all the hype going. The price shot up like this. And as soon as it got right here, the creator cashed out and\ndisappeared with over $3 million. - Wow! It went to zero. - This happens all the time. Well, why are people buying it? People wouldn't be buying it\nif it wasn't honest, something. People are willing to buy\nwhatever if there's enough hype. - Why are you buying it? - Because it's Supreme. - And because of guys like this, a 33-year-old California dude\nwho put his entire savings into Dogecoin, and now he\nsays he's a millionaire. Everyone wants to be this guy. They want to be the next\nversion of this dude. This is classic casino psychology. The winners are nice and loud, telling everyone how lucky they were and the losers quietly\nretreat into their shame. It all creates this false impression that everyone is getting hilariously\nrich and you're not, which happens to literally be the name of this New York Times headline, which is not very helpful for\nquelling the FOMO among people who might invest their precious money into fake Internet money. (joyous music) The fact is there's nothing backing this. This is all human\npsychology, which I get it. A lot of financial systems\nare human psychology, but when you invest in a\nhome or a business stock, you're betting on something\nthat has a track record of being useful to people. With crypto, you're investing in a belief that a bigger group of\nfollowers is coming behind you and that each of those\npeople will be betting on the same belief. - It's not even a scheme per se. It's ... I have to go make a call. - Those guys at the top need\nus to buy, or they lose. You may have noticed that recently on your PayPal app or your Cash App, you can now buy crypto. Well, it turns out that the\nCEOs of those companies, these guys are both personally\ninvested in Bitcoin. They're up here at the top of the pyramid. And so of course, they're\ngoing to make it easy for you to buy in too, because\nthey get rich if you buy in. (man laughing) (audience laughing) But the upshot is yes, it is possible to make money with this. It's always been possible to\nget rich with rising bubbles that transfer wealth\nfrom the late adopters to the early ones. That doesn't mean it's a good investment. And it also definitely doesn't\nmean it's good for the world. - Dude, you're totally\nmissing the point, okay. Yes, it is true. And you're right, that\nin these early days, there's a lot of nonsense and\nscams and garbage happening, but that's what happens\nwhen there's innovation. People jump in and try things out. They make mistakes, people get scammed, but eventually the technology matures, that's where we're headed here. Don't look at the random\ndude who's getting rich. Instead you need to look back\nat the first year of Bitcoin, back in January, 2008. - Let's talk about the speed with which we are watching this market deteriorate. - This could be the most\nserious recession in decades. - The economy was in a free fall. Banks and regulators\nhad massively mismanaged our financial system. Governments were bailing out these banks because they were \"too big to fail\". And out of nowhere, someone\nwriting under a pen name, Satoshi Nakamoto, proposed\nthis idea of Bitcoin, which was a peer-to-peer\nelectronic cash system, something that wouldn't\nneed governments or banks. The first block of code to start off this decentralized record that\nevery Bitcoin transaction would be built upon. In that first code, you\nsee a little Easter egg, a headline from the day's news of governments bailing out banks. Nakamoto wrote that \"the root problem with\nconventional currency is all the trust that is\nrequired to make it work.\" Bitcoin would solve this using the same ethic that\nhad built the Internet. Connecting strangers from around the world without the need of a middleman. So yes, this is useful\nbecause detaching money from these big institutions\nthat have screwed it up is useful for a lot of things. - Oh yeah, totally. You mean like buying drugs? - Well, yes, but also\na bunch of other things that you probably can't imagine because you live here\nin the United States. Consider Nigeria for a second. Last year, the government\nliterally froze the bank accounts of 20 people who were\nprotesting police brutality in the country. But some of them were able\nto still receive donations through Bitcoin because the\ngovernment couldn't freeze that. Look at another example, Venezuela, a place where a stack of\nmoney is worth nothing because of hyperinflation. - Purse is made entirely of the bills of the Venezuelan currency, the bol\u00edvar. Inflation is so high\nthat this money is now completely worthless. - This wiped out people's life savings, all because of trust in\nthese big institutions. These are problems that\ndon't happen with Bitcoin. There's no government that\ncan freeze your account. There's no government\nthat can print more money and de-value your coins. It's not controlled by governments\nor a team of executives. It's controlled by the community. The fact of the matter is,\nall money is turning digital. And let me guess: you probably\ntrust your central bank and your government because\nyou live here in the US. But according to the\nHuman Rights Foundation, more than half the\nworld's population lives under an authoritarian regime. - I get it, I get it. Removing banks and\ngovernments as the middleman has some major upside, but who's going to protect\nthe Nigerians and Venezuelans from Bitcoin scammers and hackers? I mean, just look at this list. This is a list of all of\nthe cryptocurrency exchanges that have been hacked. It's a really long list. Imagine if you're just a normal consumer who isn't like a tech person, like if you don't have at least\nsome institutional buffer, you're way more vulnerable. But the blockchain it's so secure. It's public record. It's verified through all\nthis fancy technology. Yeah, the blockchain is. The blockchain is a\nfantastic, really cool thing, but people aren't interacting\nwith the blockchain directly. You still need all of these services to buy and sell your crypto. It's these third party companies that turn into another middleman, vulnerable of being hacked,\nand they are all the time. But let's just say that your\ncrypto assets are totally safe. They never get hacked. You're still subject to\ninsane levels of volatility. I mean, look at Bitcoin's graph. It's swinging all of the time. It swings by 30% or more, which is great if you're\nlike a risk-tolerant guy with a ton of money to\nplay with on the Internet, this is a really fun thing to do. But what if you're somebody who\nactually needs your currency to stay stable so that\nyou can know its value so that you can go buy,\nI don't know, groceries? So how do you control\nthese hyper volatile assets so that they stay predictable? Well, maybe some sort\nof authority middlemen. And now we're right back\ninto the messy world of trust and middlemen,\ngovernment control. This is happening right\nnow in El Salvador. - El Salvador became the\nfirst country in the world on Tuesday to make Bitcoin legal tender. (man speaking Spanish) - What does this mean for Bitcoin? What does this mean for El Salvador? - Earlier this year, the\npresident of El Salvador announced that Bitcoin would become\nlike an official currency, like a legal form of money, and that every business in the country would have to accept it. - [Anchorman] It'll run as another option alongside the current currency, US dollar. - But guess what? All of the infrastructure\nto actually use Bitcoin to buy things, the app where you can actually\nexchange and buy Bitcoin, the ATMs to withdraw the cash, it's controlled by the\nnational government. It's like crypto is fantastic in theory, and for a select few people\nwho have disposable income to play around with, but it rarely happens in practice without the same old\ndynamics of a middleman coming in to make sure\nit works for the masses. - Oh, gosh, you're focusing\nso much on how it works NOW. I mean, if you were to apply that logic, like go back to the Internet 1.0. - [Woman] Information super-highway. - [Man] Everything unique for\ngreat Internet experience. - Wake up and smell the '90s. - You have an Internet\nbrowser in the 1990s. We have the birth of a website. It is a thing that you\nlog onto the Internet. You read things, you\nclick links and that's it. It is a read-only experience. People could have thought\nlike, oh, that's the Internet. Like, this is what we do. We go read things. - This is boring. - It's just a digital encyclopedia that's connected to\nother people's computers. - I don't need a history lesson. Where are you going with this? - Just hear me out for a second. - Yeah, hear him out. Come on. - Wait a minute. You're still here? - Yeah, I'm still here. I've been here the whole time, trying to make up my\nmind as you two argue. Go ahead. - Okay. So that was the Internet in the '90s, but then we got Web Two. (electronic music playing) In the 2000s, you start to see webpages go from static to dynamic. Users can now generate their own content from blogs to uploading to My Space, and then Facebook and YouTube. They're now participating in the Internet. They're up-voting comments. That's where we are now. We're in a part of the Internet where you're actually participating. We are creating the Internet together, but in doing so, we\ncreated these centralized digital kingdoms owned\nby giant tech companies who, in exchange for us\nbeing able to participate in this cool new Internet, they take our data. They show us ads and they\nmake billions and billions and billions of dollars. (joyous music) Sometimes they share a little bit of those billions of dollars\nwith the creators, but most of us are doing free work for these big tech companies\nso that we can participate and make content for their\ninteractive web pages. There is a better way, Web Three. This is what we're moving into. It'll allow us to move\nmoney, make purchases, connect with people\nwithout the permission of Mark Zuckerberg or JP Morgan or the government of the United States. They're not a part of\nthis equation at all. It is a vision for an\nentirely new type of Internet. - Do you hear yourself? You sound like some\nauthoritarian politician peddling some utopian\nvision for the future. Let's get back to facts. - Wait, no. This is actually happening. This isn't some nebulous\nvision for the future. We get it, Bitcoin was a currency that is inherently limited, but Ethereum is a new technology that uses the same concept\nof getting rid of middlemen. But instead of just allowing\nus to do the currency thing, it allows you to do tons of things that we used to need institutions for. It's something called a token. - Oh gosh, here we go again with tokens. Tokens, tokens, tokens. Tokens, let me guess, they're\ngoing to save the world. They're going to change everything. Everything is solved by\ntokens on the blockchain. All I see tokens being used\nfor is selling digital art for millions of dollars to speculators who want attention on the Internet. - Yes, making digital things\nscarce on the Internet is one of the first major\napplications for this. But this is just the beginning. You got to think ahead, man. Think about it. Borrowing money, signing\ncontracts, investing. There's so many things that we do where there are huge\nmiddlemen in the center who were making tons of\nmoney off of ensuring that the transaction goes properly. - I'll take that back. (woman screaming) I mean, just imagine an Internet that is owned and governed by the users. Instead of logging onto\neach of these platforms with your separate username, giving over all of your data, you log onto one unique wallet that holds all of your\npersonal information, all of your crypto\nassets that are protected by this very sophisticated cryptography. Your data isn't owned and stored by these giant tech companies. But instead, it is stored\non encrypted ledgers and you get to decide\nwho you share it with and how to value it. I'm telling you, I know it's really early. And all you're seeing is like\nmillions of dollar cat gifs. (joyous music) But what this is doing is\nfueling a creative boom among really bright developers, which in 10 years from now will have totally\ntransformed the Internet. - I hear you painting this\npicture of some Internet utopia, where everyone has a voice. I would love a world where users actually have ownership over what happens online and they can share\ndecision-making and revenue. And while we're talking about blockchain, this cure-all technology that\npeople just throw around, like it's going to save everything. Let us remember that in reality, blockchain is secured with cryptography, which is actually very\ninefficient by design. If you really want decentralization, you need to have a network\nthat is redundant and slow and hard to navigate without a third party being your middleman. You, the user have to\ntrust in these companies to run things smoothly. So why do you need a blockchain anymore, when now you're trusting\na third-party company to do all this work for you? I think it's a much more\nnarrow tool than you think. And a lot of people are\ngoing to lose a lot of money before they realize that that's the case. - Woo, okay. Let's all take a deep breath. That was a lot. And as impassioned as this got, I promise you it's a\nhundred times more intense in Twitter feeds around the Internet. People feel very strongly\non both sides of this. You'll probably be\nseeing it in the comments here pretty soon. I want to know which of\nthese people you agree with. Do you agree with the\noptimistic view of crypto, or do you think that this is just another obscure technology that will have its day and be a bubble that eventually bursts? For me, I'm still learning. I'm going to drink in as much\ninformation on this topic as it develops because we're\nstill in the early stages. And I actually don't think it's healthy that we have to make\nour minds up on topics that are still really, really theoretical. To me, it's a much better idea to sit back and take in the information as it comes. And eventually you'll start\nto develop your own opinion. You should be compelled\nto do so by the evidence, by the data that speaks to you, not by angry bullies in Twitter feeds. So, keep your mind open, but not so open that your brain falls out. Be careful out there. (gentle music) - Don't forget to, uh, buy\nDogecoin and buy, um, Ethereum. Ugh!"

    "title": "How the US Stole Central America (With Bananas)",
    "video_id": "WWBCl8huNMA",
    "captions": "- [Man] The American nation can not, must now, and will not,\nfrom empty establishment, form another communist government. - This is called a Cavendish banana. It's the most common banana on earth. It's probably the one that you have in your kitchen right now. It's definitely the one you\nsee in the grocery store. This banana was created in a\nfancy looking house in England. Yes, created and yes, in England. Kind of weird, bananas\naren't from England. They're originally from\nAsia and there are thousands of different kinds of bananas. So how did this banana, the Cavendish that was created in England become the banana that you eat today? Well, the answer to that is not so simple. You have to understand the\nstory of bananas, which yes, is something we're diving into today. It's a story filled with\npredatory corporations and geopolitics and American\nimperialism and disease, and really some amazing marketing. It explains how\ncorporations can grow so big that they begin to act like\ngovernments, like dictators. And it explains why this\nbanana, the Cavendish, the one you know and love,\nmight not exist soon. - [Woman] The world's most popular banana may be on the verge of extinction. Oh, and while I was diving deep into this, I discovered that there's a\nbetter tasting banana out there. One that isn't supposed to exist anymore, but I got my hands on some\nand yes, they're better. So buckle up. This is the F'd up history of bananas. We're pausing this story really\nquick because I just need to thank the sponsor of today's\nvideo, which is stamps.com, a service that I have used\nfor now several years, long before they came to sponsor a video. So it's kind of cool. A few years ago, I became independent, which meant I had to start\nrunning my own business. I quickly realized that running a business means shipping things a lot. I was shipping hard drives with footage. I was shipping gear and lenses. I was going to the post office a bunch, which is kind of my nightmare. So I Googled like what's the best way to not go to the post office\nand stamps.com came up, stamps.com is all of the things\nthat the post office does, but in your office or house. I can ship packages and\nletters for less cost from the comfort of this studio. In fact, right behind me is\nmy whole stamps.com set up, got a fancy scale. So I literally put the\npackage on this scale. It tells me how much it is. It plugs into my computer\nand I type in the address of where I'm sending it. And it spits out a shipping\nlabel that I then print with my label printer and\nI put it on the package. And then I put it at my front door and it gets taken away by the mail person. It's the easiest thing in the world. And I'm very grateful\nthat I discovered it, stamps.com is saving lots of\nbusinesses time and money. It has certainly saved me\na lot of time and money, which is why I'm really grateful that they're supporting this channel and sponsoring today's video. You can get four weeks of this for free if you want to just try it out. There's a link in my description,\nstamps.com/johnnyharris. If you sign up, you'll\nget this free trial, plus some free postage\nand a digital scale. You'll get one of those scales,\nwhich is incredibly helpful. There's no long-term\ncommitment or contracts. Just go to stamps.com/johnnyharris\nto start your trial, get a free scale and some postage and never have to go to\nthe post office again. So bananas are from Southeast\nAsia, but like 400 years ago, Europeans were taking over the world and the Portuguese brought\nbananas over to the Americas. A few hundred years later, an American sailor was in Jamaica and he found this funny\nlooking exotic yellow fruit and money started flashing in his eyes. He started selling bananas to Americans who quickly loved this new fruit. Bananas were trending. People were talking about it. So then fast forward to\nnearly the end of the 1800s. And you have the World's Fair, where all the people show up and show off their new technology. At the fair you've got this guy, Alexander Graham bell, who's showing up with his\ncute little new invention that's about to change the world. But another crowd favorite\nat the expo was the banana. Yes, bananas were equally as impressive as the telephone at the World's Fair. The banana business started\nbooming in the United States. Much of these bananas flowing\nin from New York City. The port there was dubbed\nBanana Docks for a while because of so much fruit import. So now you have all these\nAmericans eating the sweet, creamy, delicious fruit, and throwing the slippery\npeels onto the street. It got so bad that the police\ncommissioner at the time, oh God, I can't get away from this guy. Teddy Roosevelt once again. I swear I get into any story, I like to start to research it. And it's like, yeah. And then there's an American imperialism. And Teddy Roosevelt shows up. Anyway, so Teddy Roosevelt, the police commissioner starts\nputting a fine on people for throwing their banana\npeels on the sidewalk. Like this isn't just\nlike a silly, fake joke. It's like, this is a real thing. People slipped on banana peels. - Patrick, banana peel! - What did you say? (screams) - And you could go to jail\nfor it. I mean, look at this. There's this New York Times article documenting Teddy Roosevelt, the police commissioner, speaking to a room of police\ncaptains, explaining quote, the bad habits of banana\nskins and dwelling particularly on its tendency\nto toss people into the air and bring them down with terrific force on the hard pavement. This was a real issue. Banana Docks, Teddy Roosevelt,\nslippery banana peels, silly newspaper articles\nfrom the late 1800s. This isn't the story here.\nWe're just getting started. This is banana's innocent phase. It's about to heat up. Let's see how bananas\nturned from this to this. (upbeat music) The banana business\npeople in the US realized it was time to ramp up to\nmeet all of this new demand. But instead of just importing\nmore bananas from say Jamaica or other countries\nin the Caribbean, the banana companies realized that they needed to\ncontrol the supply chain. Let me explain what I mean by second, by looking at this banana. Bananas are fragile. They're soft. They spoil in like a week, but this one's like\nmoments away from spoiling. Look at those spots. To get this thing from\nsomewhere close to the equator all the way to New York City\nand then into someone's market and then into somebody's home\nall without it being crushed and without it spoiling is a fragile, quick, expensive process. And the only way to do it\nprofitably is to do a lot of it. A lot of bananas. (upbeat music) And the only way to do a lot of bananas is to control the supply chain. So it's like 1900 at this point, there's a banana gold rush happening. And there's a bunch of\ncompanies trying to figure out how to control the supply chain. And then they decided to sort\nof merge together and become this one super company called\nthe United Fruit Company. And their plan for combining was to control everything,\ncontrol the supply chain. They turned their attention\ncompletely to Central America where they know bananas\ncould grow abundantly, and where, oh, look at this. The US is thinking about\nmaking a little canal that cuts through this little narrow strip of land. So the United Fruit Company is like, that's kind of a nice perk for the region. If anything goes wrong, the US could have our backs. Foreshadowing. Am I foreshadowing? I'm foreshadowing. So yeah, United Fruit Company is like, this region, central America , looks like a great neighborhood\nto control the supply chain. They wanted to control\nthe people who worked on the farm by owning\ntheir basic survival needs. They wanted to control\nthe houses they lived in and the stores they shopped\nin and what they could buy. They wanted to control the\ntransportation by building railways so that they could quickly ship their product onto ports. They wanted to control the\nboats and the waterways so that they could get all of these\nbananas from Central America to the US before they spoiled. They started with Guatemala, pouring tons of investment into controlling every inch\nof their supply chain. Soon, they were the largest\ncompany in Guatemala. They owned a fifth of the\nfarmable land in the country. They owned all of the railways and all of the radio stations\nand radio infrastructure. And by 1901, the government of Guatemala\nactually hired the United Fruit Company to manage\nthe country's postal service. What? United Fruit was starting to\nlook a lot like a government. And the result was a lot of\nhappy banana eating Americans. So they kept going. They kept expanding their\noperations across Central America. So now with all of this\nbeautiful infrastructure and trains and land, the next strategy for making\nbananas even more profitable was, you guessed it, paying\nthe workers next to nothing. And paying them not with real money. (upbeat music) A lot of the times United Fruit paid their workers in vouchers. These vouchers could only be used in designated United Fruit commissaries. So they're not actually\nmaking real money here. So wait, now the United fruit\nCompany has its own currency? Oh, and they also had like a private Navy, 93 boats called the Great White Fleet. Then eventually they\nstarted using these boats to transport people on cruises. These boats were even\nused during World War II. United Fruit started to look\nlike a literal government. They had their hands in\neverything so much so that they earned their\nself the nickname El Pulpo, which means the octopus in Spanish, meaning they had their\ntentacles in everything all over Central America, the\nland, the crops, the people, the infrastructure, and soon\nenough government agencies. Soon these countries\nbecame so dominated by and reliant on the United Fruit Company that they were no longer run by the people or the governments. They were run by American banana companies who had all the power and\nleverage in the world. This led to the nickname Banana Republic, which is a politically unstable\ncountry whose society is exploited for profit\nfor one single product, in this case bananas. And probably not the best\nsort of thing to name your clothing store after, but just a thought, but\nlike who made that decision? United Fruit and other banana companies continued to grow and\ncontrol Central America. Eventually people got tired of this. In 1911, Honduras was like,\nall right, we're done, banana companies. We're going to take back our land. We can take it from here.\nThese are our plantations. You've gone too far. Banana\ncompanies didn't like this. So they organized a private\narmy to help overthrow the government so that they\ncould put in a president that they liked who would allow them to keep doing exactly what they were doing and also give them a tax break. So yeah, banana companies are now\noverthrowing governments. Jeez. This kept happening. Anytime there was political\ndissent or the governments of these countries started\nto step up and say no, the banana companies would intervene, and guess who had their back? The US military, and yes, we're back to Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt. What a guy. Here's Teddy stomping around the Caribbean with his big stick, making sure that American\nmilitary and business interests are protected, in Honduras alone, the US invaded seven\ntimes in the early 1900s, all in the name of protecting\nthese banana companies and other US interests from having to face these pesky locals who were so audacious as to\nwant to run their own country. How dare they? If you remember that at this time, the US was starting to get\nreally comfortable with empire behavior and central America was at the top of the priority list. The banana companies knew this, which allowed them to feel emboldened, to just sort of do whatever\nthey wanted in the region. But this is sort of child's play. It started to get a\nlot worse in the 1920s. (upbeat music) There was a situation in\nColombia where a bunch of workers for the United Fruit Company\ndecided to stop working and protest their working conditions. They were asking for a few\nthings like, I don't know, working six days a week instead of seven, or getting paid real money. The United Fruit Company\nrefuses to negotiate with them. And instead goes to the\nUS and says, hey, USA, we've got these really\nannoying workers who are trying to unionize and\ntrying to get paid and stuff. And it actually smells\na lot like communism. And the US is like, wait, what, communism? Tell me more. So then the US threatens to invade with their Marines and squash this strike if the Colombian military\ndoesn't do something first. Reminder that we're not talking about some big political\nrevolution or rebellion. We're talking about a few\nworkers in a banana plantation protesting for more humane conditions. And yet this was a priority\nfor the US government to put pressure on Colombia\nto fix the situation. Of course, Columbia didn't\nwant to make the US angry. So they responded and\nsent in their own troops to go put down this workers' strike. And they were ordered to quote, spare no ammunition. So on December 5th, 1928, these protesters are in the town square in this town in Columbia. And the Colombian army\nshows up and massacres them. Men, women, and children were\nkilled by their own military all because an American banana company didn't want to pay them a decent wage. I mean, this is madness. It is madness to think that\nthese large geopolitical forces were coming to bear over\na banana plantation. This event is called the Banana Massacre. This didn't stop in 1928, fast forward to Guatemala in the 1950s. At this point, the United Fruit Company, El Pulpo, is making major profits. They own almost 50% of the\nland in Guatemala tax-free. But this president, Jacobo Arbenz, who was democratically elected\nis trying to change things. He wants to take land\nthat United Fruit owns but isn't using and redistribute\nit to poor Guatemalans. He's sort of doing like\na Robin Hood thing, trying to like lift poor\nGuatemalans out of poverty. But of course, United\nFruit didn't like this, but instead of engaging directly with the Guatemalan government, United Fruit goes to the white house and says those magic\nwords again, communism. United Fruit then hired this PR magician who happened to be Sigmund Freud's nephew. And he worked with news\nagencies to create a bunch of fake stories that linked Arbenz, the president of Guatemala to communism, completely fake news. And not just like using that word lightly, like he created a fake\nGuatemalan newspaper, created all these fake reports and then distributed those\nfake newspapers to Congress. He planted the seeds in their minds that United Fruit Company\nwere the good guys and that Arbenz, the democratically elected leader, needed to go because of communism. It totally worked. President Eisenhower, the president of the United\nStates believed all of this. And he sent in the CIA to\nget Arbenz out of power to protect the banana people once again. It's a classic CIA coup, they\ngo find a bunch of rebels. They give them money and they train them. - [Radio Announcer] Rebels rose to oust Guatemala's red infiltrated government. - They find a leader who\nwants to be the next president that's friendly to the US\nand eventually they start broadcasting anti-government propaganda, and they turn Guatemalans\nagainst their government with all of this fake news and propaganda. They send the Navy in to\nblock Guatemalan waters. They send some bombs onto Guatemala city, and then they invade. (dramatic music) And then with these trained fighters, they go take over the government, the Guatemalan army surrenders, and the leader of the rebels becomes the new president friendly\nto the United States. And now the banana companies\nare happy and they have a guy in power that is their guy. It's like they have a playbook on how to mess with democracies around the world. And they just sort of\nfollowed the playbook. They're like, oh, we've done this before. We're going to do it again\nin Iran in a little bit. This is classic CIA coup, by the way, this coup was sort of a death blow to democracy in Guatemala. It divided and destroyed\nthe budding civil society that has not allowed\nGuatemala to recover since, all because these banana companies wanted to control the supply chain. These things leave scars, major scars, major marks on a country, scars\nthat are still felt today. Let's switch gears for a\nsecond because all of these banana coups and banana republics and massacres is like horrendous. But during all of this violence and military invasions and\nhuman rights violations, all of this meant that\nthe United Fruit Company was getting really, really\ngood at their business. They were sending too many\nbananas to the United States. There was a ton of bananas supplied, but demand wasn't rising fast enough. The average American didn't\ntotally know how to use bananas. So the United Fruit Company creates this amazing marketing campaign. (upbeat music) So now they're paying\ndoctors to write amazing academic journal articles about bananas. They cut a deal with\nKellogg's to market the cereal as something that pairs with bananas, which is something I still do today. I cut up my bananas and\nI put them in my cereal because of this campaign. They targeted moms with small children. They made recipe books. They even created a guide on\nhow to decorate with bananas. - [TV Broadcaster]\nBananas can to be served in many different and\nmany attractive ways. Blended with fruits, nuts, and gelatin, they provide high food\nvalue with nourishment. - But their biggest\nsuccess was Miss Chiquita. \u266a I'm Chiquita Banana\nand I've come to say \u266a \u266a bananas have to ripen\nin a certain way. \u266a \u266a And when they're flecked with\nbrown and have a golden hue \u266a \u266a Bananas taste the best\nand are the best for you. \u266a - The American public fell in love with this lady and bananas. They had no idea that these bananas that were being produced and\nshipped and bought with blood, they just liked how they taste. But isn't that the case\nwith a lot of things that we all consume every day. But there's one thing that US\nimperialism and millions of dollars of marketing cannot\ncontrol, which is disease. This is the part of the\nstory that I tell you that the bananas that were all the rage during the 1900s are not the bananas that you're eating today. (upbeat music) Part of United Fruit Company's\nefforts to control everything was standardizing the\ngenetics of the banana, making them all exactly the same. Monocultures is what we call that. The problem with monocultures\nis that they are heaven for a disease because\nyou don't have to solve the same puzzle to infect another banana. If you infect one, you infect them all. And that's exactly what happened. Panama disease was a fungus that came in and destroyed banana plantations. The banana supply in\nthe US shrank rapidly. And there was even a hit song\nabout the banana shortage. \u266a We have no bananas today \u266a The banana that they had been using, the one that was getting\nreally popular in the US was called the Gros Michel,\nor the Big Mike banana, but it was now completely\ngetting ravaged by disease. So these banana companies\nare freaking out. They're like, we are done, we've built this entire empire and this disease is going to wipe us out. So they started to scramble\nto find another banana. It turns out there's like a thousand types of bananas out there. There's red ones and\nblue ones and teal ones. I mean, a blue banana. I feel like I have to eat a blue banana at some point in my life,\nbut here's the problem. Us Americans, we buy our food\nkind of with our eyes first. We're just like, it needs to look good. And so these companies\nrealized they couldn't send a blue banana to the United States. They needed a banana that\nlooked similar, yellow, sweet and seedless so that\nthey could keep selling to Americans who hopefully\nwouldn't notice the switch. Enter our friend, the Cavendish banana \u266a God save the precious queen \u266a Like I said at the beginning, this banana was invented by a\nBritish guy who was tinkering with banana seeds in this\namazing looking house in Northern England. And after years of playing\naround with the genetics, the plant finally flowered\nand popped out this big, beautiful yellow banana. And so he named it after\nthe Duke William Cavendish. So now here's the sad part. The Gros Michel, the one that had caught on\nthat was like the big hit in America was a way better banana, is a way better banana. It is sweeter. It's more durable and it's\njust overall a better banana compared to the Cavendish. In fact, the artificial banana flavor\nthat we have in our candies, like Laffy Taffy comes from\nthe original Gros Michel, not from the Cavendish, but the Gros Michel was getting\ndestroyed by this disease. And the Cavendish was luckily\nresistant to the disease. So the dictator banana companies\nmade the switch and hoped that the people wouldn't care or notice as long as they looked the same. And guess what? It totally worked. They quietly switched out the\nbanana to the new Cavendish and people just kept buying bananas. I mean, I can't believe that there\nis a better banana out there that I have not tasted. I wonder if I can get my hands on one. (upbeat music) The Gros Michel banana still exists. It's just a select few people\non this planet still grow it. And I found a farm that sent me a few. I'm going to try this thing. Gros Michel. Let's do this Beautiful banana. Wow. I'm obviously primed to like this more so I don't know if I'm\nreally liking it more, but it's definitely a better\nbanana right now in my mind. Slightly different color. It's got this like burgundy vibe going on. It's sweeter. I like the texture more. I think this is a better banana. Too bad this thing got completely\nwiped out by a disease. So let's get up to speed\nbefore we finish the story off, because the last part of\nit is quite interesting and applies to our modern day. To summarize, came to the US, predatory\ncompanies invaded whole countries to help the US exploit them for bananas while using amazing\nmarketing to keep demand up. And because of this Panama Disease, they had to switch to the\ninferior Cavendish banana. So where do we go from here? United fruit eventually\nrebranded to Chiquita. They're still doing\nsome pretty shady stuff like paying millions\nof dollars to terrorist death squads and getting sued by workers who've become sterile\nafter handling pesticides. Banana companies will\nprobably always do this. Because the other thing that remains is that bananas are still soft and spoil quickly and grow in far away places from where you eat them. So the entire supply chain\nneeds to be controlled. And the other thing that\nhasn't changed is that the new banana is genetically optimized so that every banana is exactly the same. So it fits perfectly into these boxes, into these crates, onto these ships, into these supermarkets. But guess what? There's another disease. The Panama disease, the one that wiped out the Gros Michel, it's back and it's mutated, and it's coming for the Cavendish. And what's tricky about these\ndiseases is there's no way to detect them before they\narrive before it's too late. It just quietly kills the banana trees and makes it impossible\nto ever grow there again, you have to burn the entire plantation. This is already happening\nin the Philippines, which is the second largest\nexporter of bananas, the disease has devastated the\nland and the banana economy. It's making its way through Asia. But Asia is super far away and it's like, there's a whole ocean in between. All our bananas come from\nLatin America. Wrong. In 2019, it was detected in Colombia. And in April of this year,\njust a few months ago, the disease was found in\nPeru, right next to Ecuador, which is the largest exports\nof bananas that come to the US. It's coming for your bananas. So everyone's on high alert and bananas as we know them might be doomed. So now we're seeing history\nkind of repeat itself. We're looking at the potential collapse of a $25 billion industry\nand entire economies, which is like hundreds\nof thousands of jobs. (dramatic music) To me, the big problem here, the thing that's repeating\nitself is the same problem of United Fruit Company going\nin and trying to control every angle of their\nproduction to maximize profits. When we have companies\nthat feel emboldened to do whatever it takes\nto make the most profit, you're going to get situations like this, whether it is banana massacres in Columbia or a coup in Honduras or a monoculture that\ngets wiped out by disease time and time again, we try to engineer our\nway out of these problems and we sometimes do, but\nat the end of the day, nature will catch up with us. And as long as we ignore the\ntrue cost of these economies, the cost to people, to\ndemocracies, to ecologies, we're never actually going\nto get rid of these problems. Thanks for watching. I'm going to eat a Cavendish now. See you."

The answer, pump it in;\nthe question, where from? (soothing electronic music) - But the reality is this\nwater is not just water. It represents something so much bigger. This entire project is happening\nfor a very specific reason. (funky music) The flags on the side\nof this dam represent this joint venture between Turkey, and the so-called Turkish\nRepublic of Northern Cyprus. A country that doesn't technically exist, but Turkey wants it to exist. And that's why they\nbuilt this umbilical cord from their country, to the country they're trying to make a real country. (funky music) I want to talk to the\npeople who live here, to understand what it feels like to live in a country that doesn't exist. (energetic electronic music) - [Male Speaker] Tanks of the Turkish Army are about to compete\ntheir victory in Cyprus.

Thank you, BetterHelp, for\nsupporting this channel, for supporting my reporting in journalism. And now let's get back\nto the island of Cyprus. - [Johnny] My hope is that this pipeline will make a lot more\nsense in like 10 minutes. By then, you will understand\nwhat this really means, both geopolitically, and on a human level. It'll also make sense how\nthis pipeline is connected to the people who live here. Like this guy, Vedat, a Turkish Cypriot who sometimes wishes he\ncould get off this island. - I'm not hugely ambitious,\nbut I do want to leave- - Yeah.\n- if I can. - [Johnny] But for all\nof that to make sense, you have to understand the\nTurkish side of the story of what happened in 1974. (slow piano music) - (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] The Cypriots became independent from the British in 1960. Soon, the two groups on\nthe island were clashing. The Greek Cypriot majority\nbullying and massacring the Turkish Cypriot\nminority, who were driven out of their villages into\ncamps around the country. This was one reason why, in 1974, Turkey felt emboldened to intervene, to save the Turkish Cypriots\nfrom this persecution. - [Male Speaker] It's no\nwonder that the Turks rejoice, no wonder that the siege is\nbut a bad memory from a past, which will never return. - (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] Turkey took over\nthe North of this island, forcing Greek Cypriots to\nleave their homes empty, only to be filled by Turkish Cypriots coming north for protection. (overlapping background voices) - [Male Speaker] They won't return while the Turks are there. (tense piano music) - My new mechanic friend, Dogay, came to this village that\nused to be a Greek village, but was now empty from\neveryone having fled. And he found a home. So this is- just moved in here. - [Male Speaker 3] They moved in. - [Johnny] And the\nTurkish military gave him, and his family, a home to live in. Oh, this is the house\nthat they moved into. - [Male Speaker 3] Yes. - When they arrived to this house, they found all the mundane\nthings of a normal life: homework from a high\nschool geometry class. - [Male Speaker 3] This is schoolwork. - [Johnny] Schoolwork? Furniture and art, lots\nof art, original art. The people living here\nmust've been artists. - (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] How did it\nfeel to arrive to a house that had people's art\nand belongings in it? - (speaking foreign language) (energetic electronic music) - [Johnny] By August,\n1974, Turkey had taken all of this land, which was now considered a safe haven for Turkish Cypriots. But the world didn't like this, they were calling this\nan illegal occupation. So Turkey held fast to their\nline of being protectors. - [Male Speaker] Generals\nof the Turkish high command, their victory complete, arrived\nin triumph to acknowledge the greetings of those they'd saved. (energetic electronic music with piano) - (speaking foreign language) - [Male Speaker 3] But then\nfreedoms are never given. You have to take 'em. I'm afraid we had to do that, only Turkey could've helped us. - [Johnny] Turkish Cypriots\nfelt saved by Turkey, but Turkey's motives for\ntaking over all of this land wasn't just about saving\n100,000 or so Turkish Cypriots. (tense electronic music) Starting in 1974, Turkey set\nabout on a decades-long project of turning this land\nthat they just took over, into a country-like space,\nthat could help fulfill Turkey's bigger objectives in the region. While also ensuring that\nthis 35% of the island would never be reunited\nwith the rest of the island. (energetic electronic music) There's this phrase we use\nin international relations, called, \"Facts on the ground\". It describes what geopolitical\nsituations actually look like on the ground, versus\nwhat they technically should look like, according\nto laws and treaties. So while all this land in Northern Cyprus, technically on paper,\nbelongs to the EU country called the Republic of Cyprus, in reality, the facts on the ground say otherwise. The facts that we're\ntalking about, in this case, are usually humans, real people occupying space and building\nphysical infrastructure. It's the same reason why\nIsrael subsidizes people to live out here in the West Bank, to make it harder to ever\ncreate a Palestinian State. Or why Russia sends hundreds of people to this remote island, to work\na coal mine that loses money, but that helps them establish\na physical presence here, in case oil is ever\ndiscovered in the Arctic. The upshot is that no matter\nwhat it says on paper, it's really hard to say that a space isn't a part of a country, when it looks and acts like\na part of that country. So this is the approach that Turkey decided to take after 1974. The Turkish government put\nout radio advertisements to rural parts of Turkey,\ntelling low-wage workers that they could resettle on a\nnearby Mediterranean island, where they would be given a\nhome, a farm, animals, money. More than 30,000 Turkish\nNationals took them up on the offer, and headed\nfor the occupied island. They filled these empty Greek homes. They started a new life. - [Interviewer] What do\nyou pay for the house? - For the time, we don't\npay. Hasn't come up yet. - [Interviewer] It's the\nproperty of the government now, is it? - Yes, it is, yes. - [Interviewer] Are you worried, at all, that the original owner might somehow have some opportunity to get it back? - I don't think so, no, (indistinct). - [Interviewer] You just don't\nthink it'll happen, you mean? - No, I don't think so, no. - [Johnny] But here's the thing. Turkish Cypriots are not the\nsame as Turkish Nationals. While they both have cultural\nroots in the Ottoman Empire, many of these Turkish\nsettlers align politically, culturally, and religiously\nwith mainland Turkey, more than with Cyprus. - Many Turkish Cypriots\nfeel that their lifestyle, and their culture, are being threatened by the current Turkish government. By building Mosques,\nby trying to take part in the change in the culture. Generally speaking, Turkey\nCypriots are very secular, part of an island, easygoing lifestyle, maybe even less religious, or enjoy their beliefs in privacy. - (speaking foreign language) - (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] In the decades that followed, Turkish mainlanders kept coming. - (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] Over the years,\nTurkey helped the Cypriots establish a new government. They renamed all of the\nvillages from Greek names, to Turkish names, and eventually, they declared this place a new country, the Turkish Republic of\nNorthern Cyprus, or TRNC. The rest of the world,\nof course, rejected this. This was not a new country, it was still the Republic of Cyprus,\nwith just 35% of it being occupied by Turkey. And indeed, efforts from\nthe international community focused on reunifying this island, making it one Cyprus. Turkey knew that the\nonly way to stop this, was not just to send\npeople to occupy the land, but also to make this place feel and look like a real country, one that is deeply reliant on\nTurkey; facts on the ground. So I'm now at a base for the Coast Guard, about to get on a boat. Wow, okay. Good morning, hi there. - [Male Speaker 4] Good morning, sir. - [Johnny] How are you? (tense electronic music) I rode with the TRNC Coast Guard. It was kind of a bizarre experience. Halfway through the ride,\nthe leader of the boat, who was sort of escorting us on this trip, started prompting me to\nget shots of this flag, the TRNC flag, which looks\nvery similar to Turkey's flag. He asked me a few times to get this shot. For all of the military\nand government ridealongs I've been on, this was a strange moment. And it clearly revealed\nwhy the TRNC Coast Guard let me come here in the first place, why it was fairly easy to get access. Turkey wants the world to see\nthat this is a real country. \"Look, it has a real\nmilitary with a real flag.\" But in reality, if you\npeek under the surface, you'll see that this TRNC\nmilitary has anywhere from 3-9,000 troops on the island; compare that with the\nmore than 30,000 troops that Turkey has here. And, in fact, two thirds\nof the entire TRNC budget is funded by Turkey. The TRNC is a place sponsored by Turkey. (tense electronic music) And they eagerly let me\ncome cover their military, or get shots of their border crossing, so that I would broadcast\nthese \"facts on the ground\" to the world, to show how\ncountry-like this place feels. And indeed, admittedly, it does. (energetic music) So the big question I have is, \"Why?\" Why does Turkey do this thing that the rest of the world condemns, just so that they can\nhave 35% of this island? The first answer to that is\njust general geopolitics, whose tagline is, \"Control more land.\" Especially land that recently had a deposit of oil\nand gas off its shores. - [Male Speaker 4] The\nGreek-dominated Republic of Cyprus is now set to profit from natural gas. - So on the agenda, in Brussels, yesterday, was- - (multiple voices) Turkey. - Turkey's drilling for oil and gas. - In the hotly-contested\nEast Mediterranean. - Off the coast of Cyprus. - [Male Speaker 4] People here are worried about another war. - [Male Speaker] A single incident could easily draw the region\ninto a devastating war. - [Johnny] Turkey claims that all of this is the economic water of the TRNC, but no one on Earth would let that happen. So in response, Turkey opened\na new base on the TRNC, with drones and other\nmilitary infrastructure, just to reinforce their\nclaim with firepower. The other major reason for all of this is just straight-up nationalism. The current president\nin Turkey is sort of a, \"Make Turkey great again,\" kind of guy. Owning Cyprus is just another place for him to spread that\nideology and religious fervor. And PS, that Turkish Nationalism,\nis also spread vigorously by his army of Turkish\nNationalists on the internet. You'll definitely see them in\nthe comments of this video. But yeah, Turkey wants to\nkeep this part of Cyprus. They don't want it to\nfall back into the hands of the Republic of Cyprus,\nwhere it would become a member of the EU, and part of a country that isn't super friendly to Turkey. Okay, so geopolitics, blah-blah-blah. What about the people? The people who are actually\nliving here every day. We can look on a map all day long, but I came here to talk to\nthe people who live in a place that is more and more reliant on Turkey. (energetic electronic music) (soft electronic music) How do you feel about\nTurkey, the country, today, and its presence here? Does it feel protective? - To be honest, to me, it\ndoesn't feel protective. It feels rather like\ndigesting conquered territory. That might sound extreme to\nsome, but that's how I see it. - You live in a country\nthat the rest of the world doesn't recognize as a country. - Yes. - How does that feel to you? - It feels secluded, to be honest. - [Johnny] This pseudo-country\nof Northern Cyprus isn't able to trade\nwith any other country, any goods that come in here, have to go through Turkey first. Any goods that go out of\nhere, have to go to Turkey, and be handled or modified in some way, so that they are technically\nTurkish, all of a sudden, and then they can be\nshipped out into the world. - [Male Speaker] Only 63\nforeign ships were handled at Famagusta last year, for the\nregime is not yet recognized by anyone but Turkey. The biggest single user\nof Famagusta's port is the Turkish military;\n137 ships last year. - I have to say this, like\neverything in the TRNC's like a cheap knockoff of\nthe original. (chuckles) - And then you have the airport\nhere in Northern Cyprus. Again, it's sort of an illegal airport, it only flies to Turkey, it\ncan't fly to any other country. - It feels like there's the TRNC, and then there's the world. - Yeah. - So everything else is different here. - Yeah. - Most of the diplomas\nthat you get from TRNC, they aren't recognized\nanywhere in the world. I think there are exceptions, to like, one or two universities, but most of them are practically useless if you're planning to go abroad, because\nthey're not recognized. - [Johnny] All of this\nmakes the people here locked into Turkey's world, for trade, for business, for security, for government funding, it's all Turkey. - [Male Speaker]\nEverywhere, mainland Turkey casts a giant shadow. What then of the Turkish Cypriot identity? Cyprus is already divided. Will the North soon become\njust another Turkish province? (slow electronic music) - (speaking foreign language) - Well, ultimately, I believe that Cyprus belongs to Cypriots, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike, but they should have the final say in the future of their country. - [Johnny] And that gets\nus back to this pipeline. The one that sends water from\nSouthern Turkey into Cyprus to provide drinking water\nfor the people here. Is it starting to make more sense now? I called this \"an umbilical\ncord\", because it represents just one of the many ways that Turkey, who calls themselves the mother country, has made the TRNC reliant on them. Now, listen, it's one thing\nto fund the government and the military, and be the only gateway to the global economy. But this is water, for\nheaven's sake; it's survival. This is a much deeper level of reliance. This reliance was made very clear in 2020, when the pipeline burst. The towns that have their water systems now linked into this pipeline were without water for\ndays, sometimes weeks. They eventually fixed the\npipeline, but all of this revealed just how reliant these people now are, on the country across the sea. Turkish Cypriots, of course,\nwould never go for this if they had another option. But the reality is, they don't,\nbecause they needed water. So they took the gift. - They'll say, \"We came and\nwe saved you, you need us.\" So all of this- sort of\nlike, yes, they did help when we needed it, back in the day. But just feels like now\nwe're being held hostage by the fact that they helped. - [Johnny] All of these\nreliances on Turkey, make it less and less\nlikely that this island will ever find unity again. With every Turkish\nNational that moves here, or every bit of money\nused to build the military or government here, with\nevery infrastructure project, real peace on this island\nbecomes less and less possible. Facts on the ground,\nmore and more every year, just as Turkey intended. But listen, I want to\nmake one thing clear. This isn't as simple as Turkey holding the people of Cyprus hostage, it's more nuanced than that. Especially if you were a Turkish Cypriot in the '60s and '70s. - (speaking foreign language) - (speaking foreign language) - [Johnny] These were\nminorities who were bullied and massacred, and they found refuge when Turkey came in to save them. That's a reality that's\nnot easy to forget. But in the end, it's\nclear that even despite the pro-Turkey feelings\namong some Turkish Cypriots, what Turkey has done to this island is prioritized Turkey's interests, and not the interests of the people. Who, even though they\nreceived all of these gifts, really pay the price of being\nTurkey's political pond. Something that has been\na theme for the people on this island for literally\nthousands of years. (slow electronic music)"

    "captions": "(photo reel clicking)\n(dramatic music) - [Johnny] In 1974, the people of Cyprus had their country invaded. - [Reporter] Turks have lost patience, have given up words in favor of war. - [Johnny] And now, almost 50 years later, the island is experiencing\na second invasion. But these invaders don't want land. They don't want money or power. They aren't even Turks\nor Greeks or British. They're donkeys. (donkey brays) (dramatic funky music) (donkey brays) - I want to tell you about these donkeys, but first I want to thank today's sponsor who supported my trip to Cyprus and supports this channel generally. So thank you Bright\nCellars for supporting. Bright Cellars is a company\nthat sent me a box of wine. And this wasn't just any\nold random box of wine, this was a box of bottles of\nwine that were chosen for me based on a quiz that I took. And then my favorite part is\nthat each of these bottles comes with an education card that provides serving and pairing tips. It gives some background on the wine. And it allows you to have a much more educated tasting experience. For me, wine becomes way better when you actually have a story behind it, you actually have an understanding of what's going on with the wine and what it pairs with and all of that. The cool thing is, you can do this from the comfort of your couch. You don't have to go anywhere. Bright Cellars is all online and again, they ship it to your house. And then you can rate and give feedback on the wines that you like\nto better hone the algorithm so they know what to send you. It's literally like the Spotify\nDiscover tab, but for wine. Bright Cellars is so\nconfident that you're going to be paired with the right\nwines because of this quiz and process that if you\ndon't like the wine, they'll literally send\nyou a replacement bottle in your next box. If you want to try this out, Bright Cellars is offering 60% off your first four-bottle box. That's $38 for these four bottles. Not each, like for the\nwhole box. It's 38 bucks. There's a link in my description. Go click that link and take\nthe quiz to get started and get 60% off your first\nbox of Bright Cellars wine. Thank you, Bright Cellars\nfor supporting this work. And now let's get back to\nCyprus to talk about donkeys. I'm in Cyprus. And I am\nlooking at a lot of donkeys. (upbeat funky music) All over this island,\nthere are tons of donkeys. They're just everywhere. These donkeys don't belong to anyone. They don't have a farm\nthat they're working. They don't have a home besides the wild. They stop traffic. They're on the road. They just don't care. They just,\n(Johnny laughs) they're just so stubborn and they just sit there\nand they're just like, \"Hey, cool. You're a car.\" Inevitably comes the question. \"What are these donkeys? And how on earth did they get here?\" Answer to that question, like every other part of this series, has to do with the conflict. - [Reporter] Tanks of the Turkish army on the outskirts of Famagusta, are about to complete\ntheir victory in Cyprus. They will take what they want\nto Cypress by force of arms. - [Johnny] So we're now in\nepisode three of this series, and hopefully you're familiar with the story of this island by now. To summarize, in 1974, the Turkish government invaded\nthe Northern part of Cyprus. In that process, all of the Greek Cypriots\nwho lived in the north fled to safety in the south and\nall of the Turkish Cypriots in the south fled to safety in the north. The Greek Cypriots who were up here fled and left their farms empty. Their homes, empty. Their churches, empty. But they didn't take\nthe donkeys with them. (funky music) There weren't that many at that point, but the donkeys started\nwandering the countryside, finding food.\n(donkey braying) Then they started mating, not having a natural predator of any kind, so they started proliferating. Classic invasive species type situation. So modern day Cyprus is\na pretty advanced place, but not too long ago, these\nplaces were agrarian societies. (ethereal music) For thousands of years, Cyprus\nhas been the home to farming. To a serious amount of farming. - [Reporter] Wherever\nthere is water and earth, there the Cypriots find\nthere's food and livelihood. - Some of the best olive\noil production on earth historically has happened here in Cyprus. - [Second Reporter] They've grown olives and all sorts of fruit\nin Cyprus for longer than anyone has written harsh history. - So I'm trying to read my lines, guys, for this video I'm making, so could you just sort\nof give me a minute? Could you give me a minute? Thanks. - [Announcer] And these\nare the recently introduced John Deere 55 Series. - [Johnny] Even in the 1970s, when tractors were\nnormalized around the world, owning a tractor in Cyprus\nwas actually very difficult. This was an island in the Middle East. It was difficult to import stuff here. So the farmers stuck to\nwhat they had been doing for literally thousands of years, using animals to do their farm work. Horses were expensive\nand not very abundant. And so donkeys were the answer. In 1974, when the Turks invaded the north, it was estimated that\nthere were two donkeys on average for every farming household. And with one third of the\nisland's population being farmers, that means a lot of donkeys. Donkeys were the powerhouse\nthat would help pull plows, or run mills that would make olive oil. So after this mass exodus from the north, these donkeys were left abandoned,\norphaned by the conflict. So, there's donkeys everywhere. Why is that a problem again? Is that a problem? Well, it wasn't a\nproblem for a while until the donkeys proliferated so much that there ended up\nbeing thousands of them here in Northern Cyprus. It started to become an\nissue when the donkeys started showing up to farms and pulling up all of the\ncrops and eating them. It's like the revenge of the donkeys. They're like, \"You left us out\nto dry when it was war time. We're coming back to get revenge.\" No, but seriously, this\nbecame like a real issue for the farmers in this\nregion who were just like, \"I don't need wild donkeys\nmessing with my crops.\" (funky music) So the natural response\nfor a lot of people was, \"Why don't we just hunt these donkeys and just thin out the\npopulation by hunting them.\" But after one group of\ndonkeys was found dead, there was a big backlash. And in fact, a backlash\nthat brought Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots together\nin an unlikely moment of collaboration and cooperation. Animal rights activists on\nboth sides of the border got together and lobbied for a law that would make it\nillegal to kill donkeys, and in fact, would come with\na seven year prison penalty, if you killed a donkey. if you have a hard time understanding why these donkeys have protected status and why you'll go to jail for\nseven years if you kill one, that's because you don't understand Cyprus' connection to\ndonkeys, and neither did I. (gentle spirited music) As well as being an integral part to this Cypriot agricultural\neconomy for thousands of years, donkeys were also used as a status symbol. They were exchanged for land. And when the British occupied this island during World War II, they used donkeys to transport\nweapons and ammunition. Cleopatra used to bathe in donkey milk, which was like a very superstitious thing. And people still believe that it has some sort\nof medical properties, and so they make medicinal\nsupplements out of donkey milk. The Cyprus donkey has been on this island for thousands of years, long before machines ever came\nalong to replace their job, long before the borders shifted\nand divided this island. And yes, while it seems\nlike there's a large number of these Cyprus donkeys here in the north, a recent survey found that there\nare only around a thousand. Which is far less than the\ngiant pandas in the world. It's less than the amount of\nblack rhinos in the world, and it's less than the amount of the Sumatran orangutans in the world. So there are real\nreasons why these donkeys are being saved and why you'll\ngo to jail if you kill one. There's simply not very\nmany left in the world. Which again, feels a little bit hard to tell when you're here. But more than being endangered, I think the real reason why\nCypriots, both Greek and Turk, are so protective of these animals, is because they represent to them a time when this island\nwasn't split in two. A time when everyone\nhere were just Cypriots. In the same way that these donkeys are not Greek donkeys or Turkish donkeys, they're just Cypriot donkeys. And yes, it's also because\nthey're really cute. I mean, they are kind\nof beautiful animals. Like I've never taken a\nmoment to think about donkeys and look at them. But they are like really\nkind of striking animals. (gentle ethereal music)"

    "captions": "this was homes these were people's homes but they got swept up in the conflict let's pause here if you zoom out and look at where we're at right now you can see that i'm moving through these dashed lines i've been moving in and out of these dashed lines all week this is a border crossing but every time i call these things borders i get corrected we do not use the term uh porsche these are two ceasefire lines these are not borders yeah so cyprus remains one country there's one member state within the united nations yes the lines and what you call them are very sensitive here but it's hard to deny that they still feel like borders they exist like borders in that their goal is to divide people this right here for example is a crossing through one of these dashed lines to get into the north of this island into a self-declared country a country that no one recognizes besides turkey and it's supposedly not a real border crossing this crossing over here that's not a border crossing sure felt like a border crossing there are gates and passport booths and customs and pcr tests so did i just enter into a new country no but kind of i'll let you decide there is no greek cypriot politician who supports a two-state solution these lines are ambiguous they're emotional they're political and you can learn a lot about them simply by crossing them i now i am driving on the left side of the road for the first time in my entire life and i can't tell you that i feel calm about it which is why i came to this island cypress to cross as many of these lines as i could to understand them these lines that envelop towns that cut up farmland bleed into the ocean and infamously cut this capital city in half making it the last divided capital on has many earth and many times english armenian french arabic christian and muslim as a result the turks hold more than two-thirds of the island's wealth nearby liberal street has been known as murder greeks and turks live uneasily side by side nicosia capital city of cyprus the center of the bitter struggle between greek and turk is engulfed in war let's make one thing clear despite what you might be thinking after you watched episode 1 cyprus is not a war zone it's not all military barriers and troops quite the opposite this place is actually a tourist's paradise not too far from all the barriers 2 million tourists a year most of them british can be found sunbathing in these beautiful mediterranean waters the largest city and capital called nicosia feels like many other cities full of shops and stores people going about their lives but if you walk around here long enough you'll start to notice that a lot of these streets stop at an abrupt dead end these dead ends are made up of military barriers sandbags barbed wire military outposts soldiers with guns and flags lots of flags these dead ends are the dashed lines you see when you look at google maps the ones that cut through this city but in real life these lines are not dashed they're not porous these are actually very thick lines that successfully divide this city into the greek side to the south [Music] and the turkish side to the north [Music] and in the middle there's space sometimes thick sometimes thin a space that is given this sterile name the buffer zone and remember these are ceasefire lines not borders at least not according to any greek cypriot or un official that you talk to but call them what you want on paper i want to see what these dashed lines actually feel like when you cross them in reality this space this buffer zone is a scar a messy series of curves that in the 60s and 70s acted as a sort of shock absorber in a war that ripped this city and island apart it was the united nations that helped hastily draw these lines to stop the fighting between the greek and turkish sides to keep these two groups who had lived side by side for centuries away from each other here in the center of nicosia the narrowest part of the buffer zone is only three meters from one side to the other side two soldiers on balconies on either side of the street could touch each other i spent time in both the turkish and greek sides of nicosia but i really wanted to get a peek over these walls into that ambiguous space that used to be the central downtown but now lay locked between these dashed lines so i'm on a roof now that is in the middle of nicosia the capital and i am walking closer and closer to this buffer zone this scar that rips through the center of the city the republic of cyprus effectively ends right here and right there that street is no man's land i mean that's the north right there like i'm looking across the border into northern cyprus this was just a normal part of the city but because of the fighting the line pushed back and forth and back and forth and eventually settled here but it wasn't always like this [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm now down on the street walking in this no land it just really gets thin i mean right man's it's like we've been in places where it's really wide but right here is 30 meters greek side turkish side right there you can look above and just looking at these businesses and these homes you can envision them alive and thriving and this street seems like a very busy main street with all of these uh businesses and places and these signs that are just left one greek cypriot's house was right here her name was annie and she refused to leave she lived here for decades with the un soldiers often bringing her her groceries her front door walked right out into the buffer zone right in the crosshairs of turkish military it would have been within their right to fire if she walked out into this buffer zone and yet she remained and then in the 90s she died of old age here in her home she was 91. the soldiers removed her body they gave her a funeral and according to the reports at the time her body was the last thing to leave her home everything else stayed frozen in time much like the rest of this buffer zone we're in a wool shop an old wool shop and the owner's records are just here like just spread out on this table goods of italian origin this guy had quite the business there was commerce there was an economy there was trade there was this place was thriving and then it just collapsed i you're absolutely right the buffer zone is a unique environment the reality is is that since 1974 the buffer zone has been a de facto area of very little human activity yeah and what has happened as a result is the ecology of the buffer zone is unique to this island you will find species of plant and fauna here in the buffer zone that you will not find anywhere else this divided capital and the time capsule buffer zone that cuts it in half is one face of this divided island but as you drive you soon see other versions of it as i moved into the eastern part of this island it turned from divided city into these british bases and then more and more you start to see rural parts of this island [Music] and yet the dashed line continues even all the way out here it spans 180 kilometers from east to west um further to the east of the island is are the flat farmlands of the buffer zone where we see a lot of farming activity so one thing you see in the buffer zone is a bunch of farmland like people's homes and land that they had to leave in 1974. unsurprisingly this was a giant loss for a lot of families and so the u.n actually allows them to come back in to their old land and cultivate it so in addition to all of these farms there's also mine fields this was where people lived and was just a part of cyprus but for the past several decades this has just been no man's land in many ways farm life within the buffer zone is similar to farm life anywhere else i started growing tomatoes and i think this land all i put tomatoes i planted tomatoes but there i have their peppers over jeans i have to fix the land to clean it yeah but every day there are harsh reminders of what has become of this farmer's land of his home his work here is so distinctly juxtaposed to what you can see in the distance turkish military outposts barbed wire fences uns courts growing political tensions and yet every day that passes this becomes a more permanent fixture of life on this island it's the world terrible thing i remember everything and because i i've been in a school for one year if i'm augusta i was 12 and we started the rejuvenation there and after the war even despite all of this greek cypriots insist that their country is not divided when you use the the 10 poster that means even us ourselves we have already divided our country and cyprus uh is is is not divided is occupied uh uh 35 percent of the of the island of cyprus is occupied and while that's true according to the map and to the international community the fact remains that this division is very real so real that it's embedded itself into the minds of people young and old who live here and i remember when i was in primary school when i was first grade and i've always seen the secret flag as divided so i was always seeing the red line and we had to color the flag and have actually drew it yeah and the teacher was like georgia we're not you know we're not divided [Music] but as a kid you just thought that that's how it was so i think it's the experiences that we get from like very young and it's very difficult to get rid of these emotions i think in 1974 effectively the two communities have been divided and we have seen generations of young people since 1974 who have not had any contact with the other side and the power of these lines isn't how they affect the treaties and the peace talks and the diplomats but instead how they stop the sides from seeing each other from humanizing one another leading to only more polarization when people were referring to the other side we were thinking that there was no life and was just ghosts as kids because when people die they also go to the other side when we had the first experience of crossing from the checkpoint we did have a hesitation that what will happen when people hear us talking in turkish and what will their reaction be so while the un might not recognize these as borders they serve the same purpose to divide people both physically and mentally from one another i was born in a divided island and then i can see that in the last 20 years nothing has changed it's really changed for me so um i can't say that like and even hope that we had as children i think that now there's nothing to keep our faith up so it just seems that even if change comes it's not something immediate it's not something that will come like soon and yet even though the younger generation grew up with these barriers in their country and in their minds that has also allowed them to see these lines more clearly to question them in a way that the older generation never could do you think that the younger generation has more of an appetite for unity than maybe the older generations who experience some of the violence history teaches us that turkish spirits and greek cypriots live together side by side yeah for many many years before the conflict they they share the same history they share the same culture they eat many of the same foods and that gives us hope that peace is possible and the young generation perhaps are at the forum leading that effort thank you betterhelp for sponsoring today's video betterhelp is a platform that makes therapy

    "video_id": "p7_TZagxjyk",
    "captions": "- [Newscaster] The Turkish\narmy opened up with tank and artillery fire, on Greek Cypriot positions\nnear the Nicosia airport. - I'm on an island in the Mediterranean, and I'm at an airport, on the\nrunway right now actually. This airport is completely empty. It's totally still, there's no one here. It's Eerie. It's empty. It's falling apart. (background chatter) The reason this airport is a ghost town is because we are literally\ninside of a border. (suspenseful music) This is Cypress. It is an island. That's just under Turkey, just to the left of Lebanon and Israel. So yeah, I'm locked inside\nof a border right now, which I'll explain what I\nmean by that in a little bit. But the shorter answer, is\nthat this is a gray zone, it is in no man's land. And in fact, challenges what we even\nmean by the word country. This airport used to be a thriving hub of international travel,\npeople everywhere. And then that changed. It\nchanged because of an invasion. - [Newscaster] The Turkish\nair attacks came sporadically, but swiftly, the main targets\nwere Greek Cypriot police, the national guard building,\nand above all, the airport, where there was some heavy fighting today. (dramatic music) The Greek Cypriots, sizeably outnumbered by the Turks, were able to put up a little resistance. - And not that long ago,\nwe're talking like the 1970s. It was that conflict\nthat locked this place into a no man's land, into a conflict that still\ncontinues to this day. (upbeat music) This airport is not the story here. This is just one piece of a huge puzzle. It's a puzzle and a situation\nthat I've been thinking about for years, the better part of a decade. I've been staring at this\nplace, thinking about it, looking at it. And I'm finally here. I'm finally here to look at it\nin the face to understand it, to talk to the people, to look at its story and\nto try to piece together an explanation of how\nthis island was divided, not between two countries,\nbut divided into four. - [Newscaster] The island where Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love\nwas born out of sea spray. Cyprus is Britain's\nbase in the Middle East and the Middle East is\nunder constant pressure. In addition to clashes with\nrebelling Greek Cypriots, the British are faced\nwith keeping the peace between the Turkish, Greek protections. Sizably outnumbered by the Turks, we're able to put up little resistance. The Greeks had no hope for victory. Hate and fear now rules Cyprus. - I came to this island\nbecause I wanted to understand something I've been\nthinking about for years. I studied it back in grad school, but never really understood it. So after years of reading\nabout this conflict and looking at it on a map, I came, I met up with some friends\nwho were also traveling in this region and who\nalso wanted to learn, to expand their perspectives on this poorly understood conflict. (campfire crackling) - So you say the island\nis divided into four, but what are the four parts? - To understand that, you have to look at the maps, (drums beating) even though the country of\nCyprus is a member of the EU and their flag literally\nhas an island on it. It has the entire island on it, the Republic of Cyprus actually looks like this. It only takes\nup 60% of the actual island, it's made up of mostly\npeople who identify as Greek. So this is it. This is the country of Cyprus, only controls this portion of the island. It's just 60% of the island. - Wait. - Okay? So that's not the whole island. What is the remaining portion? - The remaining 40% is complicated. First off, you have a small fraction of this island that is\ncontrolled by, wait for it, the British, the British,\nyes, you guessed it. - I saw that coming. - Yes, didn't we all, the British, they mainly use it for military purposes. And then you have this strip right here, that is owned by no country. This is controlled by the United Nations. It's a buffer zone, a ceasefire line set up in\nthe sixties and seventies to stop the fighting. Now the elephant in the room here, which is the rest of this map, all of this up here is\ncontrolled by the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. According to the UN and\nalmost every other country. This space is not a country, the self-declared\ncountry, that is occupying half of this island almost.\nBut if you go to this place, it feels like a country. It has like a government that builds roads and infrastructure and has\npolitical parties and elections. So it's. - So it is a country? - Kind of, it's kind of a country. - How can you be kind of a country? This land up here is occupied\nbecause there was an invasion in the seventies. And at that time, Greeks\nand Turks had to separate. They left their homes, completely empty. Thinking, maybe they would\ncome back, but they never did. - [Newscaster] As the Turks advanced, the number of Greek Cypriot refugees, pouring into the Dhekelia\nbase, is growing rapidly. - There's this city, in what\nis now the occupied north, that used to be this\nbeautiful resort town. When the invasion\nhappened, the people fled. There was a bombing on\nthis town and they all fled and they thought, okay,\nonce the bombings over, we'll come back. And they never did. It's been 47 years and\nthey have not gone back. They left their homes, they left food in their refrigerators. They left their pictures, their jewelry, just in their homes. I met a guy who left that day. He was 33. He took his two\nchildren and they drove. And after months of talking\nto the Turkish military, we got permission to go back\nwith him to visit his old home and to talk about that experience. (ethereal music) - Wait, how could this city possibly go from idyllic resort, to\nthe ghost town basically? - That's that is the question\nI've been thinking about for a lot of years now.\nAnd to understand it, it really helps to go back. (snare drums beating) The first thing to know, and the, the context of this island\nis that everyone wanted it. Always. This place is located so\nperfectly in the Mediterranean at the crossroads of\nEurope and the Middle East and Northern Africa, that it is so perfectly\nstrategically located. Everyone wanted it. It was the Persians and\nAlexander the Great. And then of course, the Romans show ups with\ntheir Jesus religion and do that thing. You get the point, like Cyprus\nwas just a strategic pond being conquered and ruled\nby one empire after another for literally thousands of years. And that gets us up to 500 years ago, which is closer to the\nroot of today's conflict. When the empire from Turkey,\nthe Ottoman empire came over, they threw out the current\nempire, which has the Venetian, and they came in and they're\nlike the Ottoman empire, now rules Cyprus. - So I don't mean to interrupt because this is all fascinating, but I have always had the\nquestion of whether Turkey is named after the bird, or\nif it's the other way around. And this is just something\nthat's bugging me forever. And I figured I'd ask you. - I mean, we, we were talking about like\nthe concrete of this land, but we can talk about\nturkeys for a little bit. So the answer to that is, turkey the bird, is definitely named\nafter Turkey, the empire. Okay. The way that it works is that\nTurkic people used to bring this bird into Europe and\nsell it and they would buy it and they would call it a Turkey fowl. Oh, there's like this Turkey fowl. It's this bird coming from Turkey, when Europeans arrived to North America and they saw what we call turkeys today. They're like, oh, that looks just like the Turkey fowl from like back in Europe, the Turks used to bring over. - Oh Wow - Let's call it a Turkey. Even though it's a totally\ndifferent animal than the, than the thing that\nTurks are bringing over. And that's how we got turkeys. So the thing you eat for\nThanksgiving or whatever is like, is like named after Turkey. - So not, not that dumb of a question. - Do you feel satisfied\nwith your Turkey answer? Cause we can move on about\nthe point of the video, which is about like how the\nisland was divided into four. Or do you want to keep\ntalking about Turkey? Because I can tell you\nabout turkeys like all day. - No, I think it's okay. Yeah. - You feel satisfied? - [Johnny's friends]\nThanks for taking the time. - Okay. So we're at the point\nwhere the Ottoman empire, the Turkey empire owns Cyprus. Okay? And this is where Turkic\npeople arrive to this island and they find mostly Greek\npeople, Greek Christians, Turkic Muslims, different cultures. And yet over the years, they made a harmonious society\ntogether where they lived next to each other, in the same\nvillages and towns in peace. Let's get to modern day because\nit's like the late 1800's, Ottoman empire is crumbling,\nlike super crumbling. And who is the new kid on the\nblock that is not crumbling, but is rising? The British. - So it's not that surprising to me, that the next part of\nthe story is the British, coming into a part of this,\nbut why would they want, this specific island? - There was particularly this\none little strip of water that made all the difference. The Suez canal was this\nnew man-made canal that cut the time from Britain\nto India, like in half, like it was so much\neasier to get to India. One of their major colonies\nand Britain was like, we need to control that. And oh, Cyprus is right there\nnext to the Suez canal. Like it's a perfect\nLily pad for us to have. - [Newscaster] The great\nimportance of Cypress can be seen from the map, important little island\nin the Mediterranean. It has become a strategic\ncenter in the Middle East zone of this world war. - So this is the big\nturning point in the story. The British owned Cyprus\nis one of their colonies and they're doing what the\nBritish do well, which is like, they're making maps,\nthey're doing demographics. And they're like, oh,\nyou are Turkish Muslims. And you are Greek Christians. And they're like separating\npeople by like identity, just sort of on paper. The people who've been living\nhere for thousands of years and being conquered by every empire, you can imagine, finally start\nto get fed up with all this. - [Newscaster] One British\narmy truck is bombed, killing two soldiers and wounding 12. - By the 1950s Cypriots were done with British rule. And they had risen up in violent attacks against the British. The British realized it was\ntime to go home and it looked like Cypriots for the\nfirst time would actually be able to govern themselves instead of being tossed\naround by outside powers. But the Greek Cypriots\ndidn't want independence. They actually wanted to join Greece. This was a political\nmovement called a Enosis. Meanwhile, the Turkish Cypriots didn't\nwant to be a part of Greece. They didn't want to become\neven more of a minority. They instead wanted to divide the island into two new independent countries, one for Greek Cypriots and\none for Turkish Cypriots. This is what a power\nvacuum will do to people. When the fate of who's\ngoing to be in control is up for grabs, people latch onto their groups and inflate their identities to divide themselves, from the other side. These were no longer just\nCypriots like they had been for centuries. Now they had to choose a team, team Turkey or team Greece.\nAnd so this is the climax. This is actually where the\nconflict becomes a big deal. - [Newscaster] 1955 saw Sir\nJohn Harding as governor and commander in-chief, attempting to reconcile a\nGreek and Turkish viewpoints, all British proposals, however were rejected and\na long period of riots and outrages followed. - The British realized\nthat these divisions between Turks and Greeks on the island, that they had helped create. We're now getting out of control. So they pulled a page out\nof their old playbook. - [Newscaster] And a new\nBritish plan described as an adventure in partnership - The plan was a classic one, to gather in London for a few days, with a few leaders and outside powers and decide for the Cypriots, how their country was going to be run. And that's what they did. They all sat in the room and\nthey wrote a constitution for Cyprus and Greece and Turkey\nwere like both in the room. And they were like, we know that you sort of want\nto like join Greece maybe, or maybe you want to\nhave your own country. You're going to get neither of those. You're going to be an independent country. And we're going to create this\nreally clever constitution where the president has to be Greek, but the vice-president has to be Turkish. And there has to be like a certain number of Greeks and Turks. And like they created this\nlike really clever constitution that was going to make\neveryone happy in theory. And then they're like, you're\ngoing to be independent. But we, the British get to stay here\nwith our bases and Greece and Turkey get to kind\nof have power still. Like if something goes awry,\nlike they can swoop in. If they really need to, that\nwas like a caveat to this, this agreement that they made in London. And in 1960, it happened. - [Newscaster] Midnight in Nicosia. And Sir Hugh Foot entering parliament is followed by Archbishop Makarios, who is to take over as first president of Cyprus. So representatives of the\ntwo Cypriot communities and of Greece, Turkey, and Britain, begin the signing ceremony, there are many documents to be signed. - Do any of us think\nthat the British crafting a constitution, that's cleverly put together\nto make everyone get along? It's really going to work. No. Right. - That sounds extremely flimsy. - It's very flimsy. - Telling other people, how they should structure\ntheir country is. - Never really works. And it's like, we've seen that quite\na few times. It's like, is anyone going to learn that,\nunsurprisingly, the whole, we wrote you a constitution\nthat says you should all get along thing, didn't work out and tensions\nbetween Greeks and Turks started to heat up. - [Newscaster] For some time, hatred between the Greek\nand Turkish elements have been building up,\nunder such conditions, it takes more than a treaty\nto preserve the peace. - I have this amazing map. I mean, actually you should see this. Remember that I mentioned\nthat like Greeks and Turks sort of live together,\nas this constitution, isn't working out violence against Turks who were always the minority,\nled them to leave their home. And they start to gather into\nthese little enclaves around the country. - [Newscaster] The Turkish\nCypriots were declaring that it would be impossible, ever again, to live in harmony with\ntheir Greek compatriots. - And so the map went\nfrom looking like this, to looking like this. - [Newscaster] The\nstrategic island continues to be the scene of daily\nviolence and bloodshed. - Over in Greece, the new military government\nsaw this happening and thought that this would be a moment\nto swoop in and take over the government of Cyprus and try to realize this dream of Cyprus being united with Greece. Then that's when Turkey's like, Greece, you violated the agreement. We weren't supposed to\nswoop in on the island. And unless there was\nsomething really wrong. And so we're going to swoop\nin because we technically on paper say that we can come\nin and restore the peace. Well, they did a lot more\nthan restore the peace. (suspenseful music) Turkey swoops in and starts\ntaking over the north in a full blown invasion with bombs and tanks and military, like troops, like hitting the like beaches with guns, like a full-blown invasion. And they start just taking\nover the north of the island and the people start fleeing, the Greeks who realized that Turkey is actually invading and\nTurkey feels justified because they feel like\nGreece did it first. And so they just keep going. - [Newscaster] From the battle going high over the capital city. The Greek Cypriots sizably\noutnumbered by the Turks were able to put up little resistance. - I've been glued to these\nearly reports of the invasion of the island of Cyprus by Turkey. There's this one journalist from the UK named Jonathan Dimbleby, who was like one of the\nfirst on the ground, when all of this was happening. And he captures the feelings\nof the people who had to flee their homes to their side of the line. - We didn't take anything with us. - In these reports, you start to hear two\ntotally different narratives. And these will go on to be\nthe roots of the modern day conflict on the island of Cyprus. The first narrative is\nthe Greek narrative, from their perspective, this is an invasion to their country, a theft of their property. Turkey was invading\ntheir sovereign territory and forcing them to leave land.\nThat was rightfully theirs. - [Newscaster] It is unlikely, - That the Turks will allow them back and there is no promise that they will be compensated\nfor their confiscated homes and businesses. It is as if the Greek Cypriot\nworld has come to an end. - We prepared to be dead. Than to live under the Turkish authority. (women sobbing) - But for Turkish Cypriots,\nthis was not an invasion. This was salvation, Turkish Cypriots had suffered immense\nviolence and brutality as minorities on the island, at the hand of their Greek compatriots. And now Turkey was\nswooping in to save them, to protect them. That's why Turkish Cypriots\ncall this, the peace operation. - When I, saw the Turks,\nI forget my unhappiness, I was very happy because\nmy, my life was saved. My children's life was safe.\nAnd my, my people, I mean, the Turks was all safe. I'm very happy. Of course. - People, the Turkish\npopulation feel more safe, secure because the Turkish\narmy is there to protect them. - After three days of an\nunstoppable offensive, the Turkish army, seems to have grabbed just\nabout all the land that it wants on Cypress, at least in the Northern\nand Northeastern parts of the island. - And then the Turks in the\nnorth declared a new country. They were like, we are now the Turkish\nRepublic of Northern Cyprus, a new country. It's effectively\njust Turkey by another name To stop the fighting, the UN carved out these twin\nlines that cut right through the capital of Nicosia, they stretch across the whole island, a buffer zone to stop the violence. And this establishes\nthe lines we know today, with the Republic of Cyprus\ncontrolling all of this, the self-declared Turkish\nRepublic of Northern Cyprus, up here, then of course, the British with the land that\nthey held onto when Cyprus became independent and\nthen this, UN buffer zone, which locks within its\nboundaries, the airport, along with people's homes,\nbusinesses, and farms. This is an island divided into four. - [Newscaster] In one way\nonly, are Greek and Turk alike. They both now belong to\na nation of refugees. - One of the reasons I came\nhere was because I wanted to see what this looks like after\nyears of looking at it on a map, what does it feel like for the\npeople to pick up and leave and flee to their side\nof this new boundary, abandoning their lives and communities. We're about to go into Northern\nCyprus for the first time. Here we go. As you drive through the occupied north, you see a lot of churches like this. (piano music) I'm in a village where\nGreek Cypriots used to live, but in 1974, they fled south,\nleaving this village empty. The Turkish Cypriots,\nwho were in the south, fled north and arrived to this\nvillage to find empty homes and this Christian church. (piano music) And they converted it into a mosque so that they could continue\ntheir religious practices. But eventually they built a\nnew mosque, right next door. And they left this\nchurch totally abandoned, where it lays today, falling apart. (piano music) Both sides suffered immense losses. And now empty buildings are\nthe most visceral solid symbol of that loss. These abandoned churches\nare peppered all throughout the occupied north, (piano music) (campfire crackling) But perhaps the most haunting\nsymbol of this switching of sides happened here, in that\nthriving Greek tourist town called Famagusta. - [Newscaster] Famagusta\nwas the tourist resorts of the island. The major port, much of the wealth of Greek\nCyprus was based here. Last weekend, the Greeks fled in panic before the Turkish tanks. They have abandoned all that they have and they won't return.\nNow, the town is deserted. (ethereal music) - We're about to go in. I've been thinking about this place for, the better part of a decade. And we're about to go in. The reason I spent months\ntrying to get access to film in this ghost town.\nWasn't just to capture it, but rather to understand the human tragedy that happened here. So I asked\nthis man to come with me. His name is Mr. Takis, he's a Greek Cypriot who\nwas my age back in 1974. He lived here in\nFamagusta. He owned hotels. He was in the tourism industry,\nbut when Turkey invaded, he did what everyone\nelse did in this town. He left with his family. And today he's returning\nfor the first time ever. - This is not easy to bear. It brings out anger. It\nbrings out confusion. It brings out disappointment.\nMy wife refused to come. I came with my daughters\ntoday. I came with them, but they tell me \"you don't talk.\" I lost my, I cannot connect. - Can you paint a picture to\nme on what Famagusta was like? - The economy was so strong here. Not only economically, Johnny, but culturally, educationally. It was a wonderful period. - I asked Mr. Takis, if you would be comfortable\nshowing me his old home. So we started walking through what used to be his entire world, the cafe he used to come to\noften, his brother's old house, where he went to school. - I spent some of my best years yet. - Wow. The school is now boarded\nup and covered with Turkish and TRNC flags. - To see this in this situation\nmakes me very, very sad. - As we walked through this ghost town, I kept trying to get Mr. Takis to go back to the Famagusta\nof before the invasion and to point out the places\nthat he had good memories from. What do you remember about\nthat time. But after a while, he finally just stopped me. - Johnny, I told you before,\nI cannot connect. I cannot. You are asking about my memories. - Yeah. - They don't bring out, the full memories I want to describe because, there is a reservation, this is not the town I lived. This is not the town that I was proud of. - Yeah. - This is not the town\nthat has tremendous history and success. It is unbelievable. - On that day that everyone had to flee, you thought you'd be coming back. - Yes, for sure. Everybody who left, thought\nthey were going away for two, three days. They didn't take anything\nmore than clothes and food. - We walked through this\ncity deep in conversation. And then Mr. Takis's\nfriend, who was with us, signaled that we were\ngetting close to the house. The one he hadn't seen since\nhe fled all those years ago, Mr. Takis didn't pick up that\nwe were getting so close. And when he looked up,\nhe realized we were here. Tell me about this building? - What should I say? - I could tell he felt caught off guard. And I began to regret having\nset this whole thing up. - Well, you didn't prepare me. - [Johnny] I was subjecting this man to a traumatic reopening\nof his old wounds. All so I could make my\nvideo about the conflict. It started to not feel right, but he assured me that we could keep going and that he wanted to do this. - No, I want to go on the other side. Let's go from the beach. - He didn't want me to see his home from this angle, from\nthis bombed out street. Instead he wanted to see\nit from the other side, from the beach, the part of this town that\nstill has some semblance of its former glory. - Not from here. From the other side. I didn't realize, we\nhad reached the house. - Yeah, It looks like there's\nan entrance over here, maybe. - Now you will get, an idea\nof why it was so popular. I think seeing. - [Johnny] Yeah, I haven't\nseen the beach yet. - This is the famous\nsandy beach of Famagusta. - As we walked towards his\nhouse. Now from the beach side, it was clear that Mr.\nTakis still felt deep pride for this place, this beach, this city. - In certain areas, there\nis even turquoise water. - It's stunning. It's beautiful. And though his city and his\nproperty and his stories are now a ghost town, occupied\nby an invading power. When you're on this beach,\nyou don't feel it as much. - Beaches like this, there\nare not many in the world. - No there really aren't. - Especially with turquoise water. (ethereal music) - And then after a moment\nwalking along this beach, we finally approached his home. This is the first time you're seeing this. - The first time I have\nseen it after 47 years. It hurts me, I cannot\nconnect in the sense that, what I see doesn't bring\nout all those nice memories and the good times that you had. You have to close your eyes\nand then it all comes back. - [Newscaster] Famagusta\nwas the tourist resort of the island. All this belonged to the Greeks. Famagusta this morning, was a ghost town. It is unlikely that the\nTurks will allow them back. - We didn't prepare. My wife still refuses to come because it's painful. I come here to do what? Like now we see it and\nI cannot go into it. What is the purpose? I'm not a tourist. It's\nmy home. It's my town. And I come here and you can't\ngo here, you can't go there. You can see your house from distance. It's a torture, It's a torture. I know it's difficult for everybody to get into somebody else's shoes, but I'm sure you appreciate\nthat it hurts a lot. It hurts a lot, hurts a lot. It's not right. - I watched Mr. Takis take\na photo with his daughters, who he had brought to see the\nhouse they almost grew up in, they stood in front of the\nTurkish military border that bars them from actually going inside. And in that moment, I felt a\nprofound sadness for it all. Unlike anything that I'd felt in the years of studying this conflict. (campfire crackling) Those conversations are so\nimportant because like this isn't just a international relations issue. This is like a human issue. It's like people and their identity and their homes being lost because of great power conflicts. To me, it's much more important\nto have those types of conversations then\njust to be zoomed out, looking at a map. Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots\nsuffered immense violence and loss of their homes and communities in 1974 and the years leading up to it. And throughout this series,\nI want to shed light, not just on this history, but what it feels like to\nlive in this place today. A country divided into\nfour, full of buffer zones and barriers and division. At the end of the day, this is a division, that was\nconstructed by outside powers, which is the story of Cyprus. The story of a strategically\nplaced island that everyone wanted and was ripped apart, purely because of where it was located. (piano music) Okay, well, you made it through\nepisode one of Uncharted, this pilot series of something that I want to do a lot more of. There\nare three more episodes. So this is just the beginning. This is a new form of\njournalism that I am pushing. And I'm really grateful to\nthe sponsor who supported it, which is Cometeer. Cometeer is kind of blowing my mind. They're a completely\ndifferent version of coffee than anything I've ever experienced. The way it works is that Cometeer, works with some of the\nbest artisanal roasteries around the world. And they make beautiful, wonderful coffee. They brew it themselves, but then they immediately flash freeze it. Like they freeze it in these\ninsanely low temperatures to like seal in the freshness and the aromas and the flavors of this roasted coffee. And then they put it in\nthese little metal capsules and send them to your house, frozen. They show up, you pull\nthem out of these capsules. You put them into a cup with hot water and you have delicious coffee, that is like the coffee that was brewed. I mean, it's, it's brilliant. And it tastes really good. Listen, I'm a big coffee guy. And I like to think\nthat I have like the art of the pourover down, with like my scale and like my timer and all this stuff. Honestly, it takes a long time, which is fine on a weekend.\nBut like during the week, like I sort of want a\nmore convenient option. I could pay for a coffee shop to make it and have it delivered to my house, which costs me a lot of\nmoney or I could pay way less and have a really good cup\nof coffee that is reliable and sustainably packaged. And all of this stuff through Cometeer. Cometeer is kind of a new thing. They're not fully open to the public yet. There's some waitlist. If you want to bypass that waitlist, there's a link in my description, it is cometeer.com/johnnyharris,\nthat allows you to bypass the waitlist and get\n50% off your first purchase, which makes this like $1 per cup, which is insanely cheap for the quality of coffee you're getting. So if this is interesting to you, go to the link in my description, clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gives you that 50% off and allows you to bypass the waitlist. I feel really excited\nthat I discovered this and we'll be using it for\nthe foreseeable future. So thank you Cometeer\nfor sponsoring this video and thank you all for being here. There are three more\nepisodes of Uncharted coming to you in the next few weeks. So keep an eye out for\nthose. See you later. (trumpet music)"

(man laughs)\n- Hold on (indistinct) (intense electronic music) - Two people-\n- Wait, why are you guys leaving? - [Man] Two people left the car. - McDonald's ice cream\nmachine is always broken. - Welcome to the vlog\ndude, I'm vlogging today. - What are you posting this on? - It's called the youtube.com. - Oh!\n- So it's like this, like platform for like\nvideo cloud-based sharing of high quality video content. They even do HD. - (indistinct) How\nwould you share a cloud? - So it's- well, it's like an HD thing. - So it's like, TV or something? - So McDonald's is being\ninvestigated by the FTC, And I'm here in Cyprus\nmaking a documentary series for the first time in a while. (mid tempo lofi music begins) And I want to show you some of it and I just need to give\nyou a bit of an update on McDonald's and all the\nthings happening right now. (upbeat electronic music) (car hits item in road) Oh (beep) - [Radio Announcer] Cyprus remains a, or that could have set off a\nfull scale war.. (indistinct) (upbeat electronic music) - I'm making like an announcement video, - A little video for your YouTube channel - Yeah, my little YouTube channel. - I'm also vlogging. - Are you? - What's going on? You're also vlogging things. - Yes! (upbeat music) (indistinct) - That's cool. Just\nbring your cat with us. - These donkeys don't belong to anyone. I'm going to jump off a cliff. I got to vlog it for my video. So today's video is not\ngoing to be an explainer. I know you come to this\nchannel to learn things. You'll learn a little\nbit about the lawsuit and the FTC investigation, but today I want to\ngive you just an update and tell you a little bit more\nabout the series I'm doing before we get into that. I want to thank today's\nsponsor who is Better Help. I've said this before. I'm a big believer in therapy. I believe that therapy needs\nto be normalized and it needs to be way more accessible and\nway more common for people. I started doing therapy with a licensed professional\ntherapist almost two years ago, and it has changed my life. It is not a crisis line. It is a place where you can\ngo to find a good therapist. Finding a good therapist is kind of hard, especially when you only have\nthe options in your city. Better Help is an online\nthing. It's remote. You can browse thousands of\ntherapists and choose one. And then if you don't really\nfit with the therapist, which is a very common thing, you can easily switch\nto another one for free, no, like calling your insurance and figuring out who's in network. And that whole debacle\nthat is just sort of, when you are already looking for therapy, you don't want to be like stressing out about finding a therapist. It's super easy to sign\nup, within 48 hours you could be talking to a professional. I really believe in therapy and believe that better\nhelp is doing a good job, trying to make there be more accessible. So there's link in my description betterhelp.com/JohnnyHarris. When click that link, it\nhelps support this channel, but it also gives you\n10% off your first month, a better help. You can try it out and see if\nit works for you. Thank you. Better help for supporting\nthis channel and for supporting the journalism I'm doing here in Cyprus. Now let's get to the update (high intensity techno music) (indistinct) - First off. McDonald's, holy smokes. So I made this video about\nthe ice cream machines. Can I get an ice cream cone? - Ice cream machine is broken,\nice cream machine is broken. And it sounds like there's\na story behind that one. Doesn't it? - This was like back in the spring. And I didn't think this\nvideo was going to give us a 30 minute video about ice cream machines and suddenly there's like 8 million views or something like people clearly\nwanted to learn about this. It made a pretty big splash. And then it turns out according\nto the wall street journal who just reported on this, the FTC is now investigating this issue, the ice cream machine makers\nto see if there's something weird going on. I think there's\nsomething weird going on. At least that's what\nthe evidence points to. I don't know what weirdness is going on, but something weird is going on and it's not just a\nfour-hour cleaning cycle. So I'm going to keep my eye on this. The wall street journal\nseems to be like really into reporting on these ice cream\nmachine makers, like me and the wall street journal. They're like in lockstep right now. (laughs) And, and so I'm going to keep my\neye on this reporting and see what happens next. Meanwhile, if you remember from\nthe ice cream machine story, there is that startup called Kytch. That is the one that sort of\ngot blackballed by McDonald's. When they tried to invent a fix for the ice cream machine makers, they have filed the lawsuit and they even got awarded\na restraining order because they have alleged and have very good evidence\nfor the fact that McDonald's and Taylor and this whole cadre\nof ice cream machine people, have gotten a hold of their technology and are using it to basically make the same thing for themselves,\nwhich is a big no-no. You don't do that. So this is still a developing thing, but the fact is that, like, I think I stepped into a can\nof worms that I didn't know was going to be a big deal. And I think the video that I\nmade may have had some effect on all of this, which is\nsort of a weird thing. Wired also put out a really\nsolid article on this, that I'll link in the description Overall, it feels good\nto be doing YouTube, but also feel like I'm\ndoing real journalism and that it's been\nvalidated on a bigger scale. Cool. You know, I left Vox and felt a little bit\ninsecure about the fact that like I'm leaving a\njournalistic institution. Like, what does that mean for me in my reputation as a\nstoryteller and a journalist, and part of me likes this freedom and this ability to be more creative and more personal and like be able to talk to you like I'm doing right now. But part of me also feels a sense of like, I still want to be like\nin the journalism world, which I guess gets to\na second little update, which is a video that I\nmade with the New York times last year, got nominated for an Emmy, which is like, okay, that's cool. The Emmy's are sort of\nlike an old legacy thing, like for like legacy TV, but more and more they're\nthey're updated and, and recognizing work that is being done now on this platform. And that's kind of exciting. I'm actually working on another piece with the New York times right now that we'll publish in the fall. So keep an eye out for that. Man. So many updates. (cheerful music) - Okay. Cyprus, let me tell you about\nwhat I'm doing here in Cyprus, Man, this is, this is probably the most\nexciting thing I have to say, where to start. On my way over to Cyprus, me, Izzy, and the boys stopped by Sicily\nand have a sort of before back to school vacation altogether, first time I was able to\npractice my Italian though, boil boys, the Italian\nincessantly, is not Italian, it's literally a different language, but even the Italian they speak\nis like, man, that was hard. It was really hard, but\nboy is the food good. (fill reel clicks) Sicily is a very wild place. And, and while there, there was some very\nstressful stuff that came up. There was like a bunch of EU announcements about the borders being closed. And we were up late talking to VCs and founders about bright trip, which is a huge thing in my life right now that I'm just not going to go into, but like bright trip is growing and we're trying to\nraise a bunch of money. And like, it's actually really hard to\ndo entrepreneurial things. I've decided like it's actually\nlike not easy to do it, which is why like most people don't do it. And I see now why people\njust sort of flake out on it after a while, because it's really hard and emotional to try to build a startup,\nbut it's happening. It's working, we're building bride trip and it's turning into a pretty cool thing. But anyway, it was a wonderful time with\nthe kids out on the road, again, after many years\nof not being on the road. And then is he in the boys, flew back to Washington\nDC and I flew here. (high energy music) So this is probably why most\nof you clicked on this video. Maybe you care about ice\ncream machine makers. Maybe you care about my Emmy nomination, but I'm pretty sure most\nof you care about like the documentary explainer work that I do. And the good news is that\nI'm doing it. I'm back. I'm back on the road. I'm doing it. - I'm back, baby. - The past year. My life\nhas been very strange. Vox borders was canceled last year. Sort of around this time and that's when I really decided that I needed to build this channel. So I started making a bunch of videos, tons and tons and tons of\nvideos that you've been seen. I've been in the office making videos, but I need to tell you that\nmy heart, my heart is here. It's out here. It's me on\nthe road, talking to people, looking at complicated stuff,\ntrying to understand it, pouring over maps and documents and looking at archive like\nthat is where my heart is. And I haven't been able to do that since, since borders was canceled, mainly because this\nchannel wasn't big enough to financially support that and COVID-19, but both of those things have changed. This channel has grown significantly. Thanks to all of you being here and COVID-19 is kind of going away. - Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye Hey, you live here in Pittsburgh. - No, it's not. Let's be honest. It's not going away. Like we thought it was, I thought it was so\nthere was this one day, Izzy and I were driving in Iceland. The boys were asleep and we were thinking, it was like two in the morning.\nIt was like light outside. Beautiful. And we were talking as Izzy\nwas talking about like, well, what do you miss about,\nabout, you know, Vox? And I said, well, I miss my colleagues. I've missed like hanging\nout with people that I, that inspire me. And then I said, I miss\nbeing out on the road. And she's like, dude, go\nlike go out on the road. Like, like you can do\nthat now on your channel. And it just hit me. And I was like, I knew at some point I was going to do it, but like now's the time. So then the question was, what story do I tell? What place do I go? And Cyprus has been on my mind since 2014. I studied peace and conflict resolution in my master's degree. And I took an entire course\nabout conflict resolution and mediation and Cyprus. The conflict here in Cyprus\nwas the subject of that course. In fact, that course, in addition to my experience in Tijuana and so many other experiences like that are what woke me up to my obsession and interest in divisions\nand lines and maps. So we spent a couple of months\njust diving deep into Cyprus. And then we came here. I came here with Jack,\nmy assistant producer, and this guy, Corey pop. I've never traveled with a\nreal camera person before. So to have Corey pop, who is\na DP that worked on explained and is just incredibly\ngood at what he does to have him with me to help tell this story was a really special moment. So for the past 10 days,\nwe've been on the road, traversing this entire island, talking to military,\ngoing on military vessels, going into buffer zones,\ntalking to the UN. It has been a deep dive\nin reporting on Cyprus. And I am so excited to share\nthese stories with you. And while I was here, I\nmet up with these guys. I invited Thomas and Nathaniel\nto come with me to Cyprus because mainly, because I just wanted to\nhang out with my friends. Like these are friends of mine that I've made on the internet that\nI talk to often, but like, don't get to hang out with very often. It's like an overall, it was\njust a good time to reflect and to bond and to have\nsome like social interaction for the first time in a really long time. - Give this guy a spritz? - No. (laughs) (indistinct) - And now they're gone and I am still here reporting in Cyprus. The stories that you're\ngoing to see me tell in this new series, which is\ncalled by the way, uncharted, that's the name of the series. The stories you're going to see me tell are going to feel like me. They're going to feel like videos I've always made, After all, I can't change that. It's sort of comes from my curiosity, that comes from my voice, but they're going to feel different. They're going to feel more intentional. They're going to feel more visually rich. They're going to feel more human. I hope, talk to a lot more\npeople than I've ever talked to. I was able to focus on the\ninterviews because I had a camera person, you know, Corey\nwas there shooting. And so I wasn't there\nfiddling with audio and, and, and getting the frame, right. It was actually like just\nfocused on the conversations and hopefully there'll\nbe just better reported, more sensitive, more clear, more informative than\nanything I've ever done. I've grown up as a storyteller and over the past year and a half. And I'm really excited to\nshare this story with you. A story that has been on my mind since, since I sat in that\nclassroom in grad school. And I was like, someday,\nI will tell this story. And I've been working\nwith my composer, Tom Fox, who has created an entire\ncustom score for Cyprus. It's like synth and\norchestral and minimal, but also like very intense and emotional. You're listening to a\nlittle bit of it right now. (intense music) So I probably shouldn't be\ngiving away all the juicy stuff of this series, but I just can't help it. There's too much good stuff. So let me just give you\na little nugget of what I've been seeing over the past 10 days.. Or the past several decades. This has just been no man's land. (intense music) (intense music) There was commerce, there was an economy, there was trade. This place was thriving,\nand then it just collapsed (intense music) (intense music) So that's it. That's my update, everyone. It feels really good\nto be back on the road. I am exhausted. My brain is still in this like\nmiddle ground where I'm still trying to like, make the\nstories like come together. There's still so much reconciling I have to do in the\nscript, but I feel good. I feel good to be here\nback in my natural habitat on the road, telling\nstories, talking to people, traversing a new place and\ntrying to understand it and trying to translate it\nto a bigger audience, so that you can catch a glimpse\nof what's happening here and the emotions and the people\nand the politics at stake. That is my goal. That is the update. Thank\nyou all for being here. And I will see you very soon\nas I kick off uncharted. (intense music)"

    "video_id": "D_PtYPnKBJs",
    "captions": "(clock ticking) - There's this one lake\nin Central America that, if you look closely enough, you're gonna see the tops\nof trees in the lake. And these, these are not islands. These are hilltops. This all used to be a\ndense jungle, not a lake. But then they built dams and\nall sorts of infrastructure to flood this forest, all\nin the name of solving a centuries-old puzzle, which was, \"How do we make it faster and easier \"to travel between here and here, \"even in spite of the fact \"that you have two massive continents \"blocking any waterway?\" But there was hope, if you look down here at this\none thin stretch of land. Here it's only 80 kilometers across, and it looked so easy to\njust cut a waterway into it. No. Turns out, that puzzle was not easy. (suspenseful music) This little 80 kilometer strip of land proved to be really hard to cut through, but as long as international\ntrade continued to grow, there continued to be great\npowers looking for new waterways to shorten their routes and\nto increase their power, for whoever controls\nthe water has the power. And these great powers always focused on this narrow stretch of land, from the Spanish in the 14th century to the Scottish in the 15th. But then, the most earnest and\nserious attempt was in 1880, when this guy, a French\nengineer, Ferdinand de Lesseps, shows up and is like, \"Hey, I got this.\" He had just completed another big world-changing\ncanal over here. He was feeling very\nconfident, and he's like, \"Yup, I'm your guy. \"Let's build another canal. \"It'll be easy. \"We'll just dig down to sea\nlevel and re-route the river, \"like we did in Egypt with the Suez Canal \"and it'll be great and I'll be famous.\" But listen, de Lesseps,\nEgypt is a flat desert and Panama is not. These mountains that you wanna dig through are well above sea level. So if you wanna dig down to\nsea level to make a flat canal, it's not gonna be easy. Meanwhile, another French\nengineer comes to de Lesseps and he's like, \"Dude,\nthis isn't gonna work. \"It's way too much digging. \"Instead of bringing the\nmountains down to sea level, \"what you need to do is bring\nthe sea up to the mountains.\" And in a moment of\ncollaborative creativity, de Lesseps admits that he was wrong and begins construction\nbased on the new plans, and then he promotes this guy\nas the head of engineering and says, \"Great idea.\" No, de Lesseps was like, \"Bring the ocean up to the mountains? \"That sounds stupid. \"Screw you. \"I'm the famous one. \"The canal is going to be at sea level, \"just like we did with the Suez Canal.\" So the French start digging. Well, actually it wasn't the French. It was a ton of poorly\npaid migrant workers who were doing the digging, hacking away at the jungle with machetes and then digging by hand with\npickaxes in sweltering heat, knee deep in sitting water, which is heaven for, you guessed it, disease infested mosquitoes,\nwhich is terrible news. But luckily, de Lesseps the engineer was always there in the\ntrenches with his workers, wielding a pickax alongside his people. Yeah, no, of course he wasn't. He was just hanging out in France, only visiting Panama twice\nover the course of seven years to just check in on the project. And what he realized when he showed up seven years into this digging is that things were going horribly. People were dying, 40 or 50 a day. All in all, 20 thousand workers died trying to dig this canal. Thousands died from disease and accidents, and we will never know their names. And it's not just that people are dying, it's that the digging\nisn't working either. They would do a bunch of digging one day, and then the next day,\nthe rain would bring in all of the mud that they\njust dug back into the canal. So de Lesseps shows up,\nrealizes this is happening and is like, \"This is not working. \"Is there another way to dig this canal?\" And then he has a flashback\nto seven years earlier. \"Bring the sea up to the mountains.\" And he's like, \"Oh yeah, that was actually\na really good idea. \"My bad, we actually are gonna\ndo that other plan instead.\" But no, it was too late. The investors were done. They had lost way too much money. 20 thousand people were dead, malaria and yellow fever were rampant. This was a fatal project. So the company that owned all of this work had to abandon it and leave\nit unfinished in 1889. Everyone gave up and left, except for one of the top\nengineers on the project, this guy. I'm just gonna call him Philippe, 'cause after researching\nhim for many days, I now feel like I'm on a\nfirst name basis with him. And by the way, he becomes\na giant part of the story, starting now. So Philippe was this French\nengineer and businessman, and he was obsessed with the canal. He also had a huge financial\nstake in the project, and where some investors would say, \"Darn, too bad, we invested\nin a bad bet, let's move on.\" Philippe was like, \"No, I\nwill do whatever it takes \"to make sure that this is not a failure.\" And what happens next is one\nof the most insane things I have ever researched in my\nentire life, so buckle up. (intriguing music) - [Newscaster] The winds of\nchange is blowing up a gale in the Panama Canal zone. - Okay, so let's get some\ncontext really quick. It's 1900 at this point. The US is really starting to get a handle on this whole Imperialism\nthing that they've been doing. They just fabricated a war with Spain, which led them to conquer the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico. They'd just overthrown\nHawaii's government. They annexed Wake Island\nand American Samoa. They're like, \"Dude, this\noverseas empire thing \"is kinda working out for us.\" The President at the\ntime was Teddy Roosevelt, who we've seen in previous episodes, and Teddy is looking around this region that the US is increasingly taking over, and he sees an opportunity\nto dramatically increase the naval power of the United States, if they could just unite the\nAtlantic and the Pacific. \"It's time to build a canal\", says Teddy. So of course they looked\nsomewhere in Central America, and the original plan that\nthe US wanted to pursue was to build a canal not in Panama, but here in Nicaragua. It wasn't the shortest\nstretch of land in this area, but there was a huge lake here, which would cut down on the digging, and it just made a lot of sense. So they started doing\nsurveys and making plans to build a canal in Nicaragua. Meanwhile, Philippe the\nFrenchman is still down here at his failed project, and he's seen the US become\ninterested in the canal, and he's like, \"This is\nmy moment of vindication.\" So he goes to the US\nCongress and he's like, \"Hey guys, I know you're\nlooking at Nicaragua, \"you've been doing all this site planning \"and surveys and stuff, but guess what? \"Right next to this proposed\nsite for your canal, \"there are volcanoes. \"Big, scary, belching volcanoes. \"And one of them just erupted around here, \"sort of next to your site.\" Nicaragua even had a\npostage stamp that featured one of these nearby volcanoes erupting. So the Frenchman goes\naround to the US Senators and distributes this\npostage stamp and says, \"Look, scary volcanoes in Nicaragua. \"Don't build your canal here \"or they'll be destroyed\nby lava or something.\" And guess what? It totally worked. The US Senate got cold feet\nabout their Nicaragua canal plan and they're like, \"Uh, we're\nnot gonna do this anymore. \"Let's find another place to build it.\" And Philippe is like, \"Oh my gosh, I can't\nbelieve that just worked. \"Stamps with volcanoes?\" He's all giddy, and he's like, \"Hmm, I wonder where there\nwould be a good place \"to build a canal. \"Oh, wait a minute, why not Panama? \"We the French already did a\nton of work to get you started. \"Why don't you just pick\nup where we left off? \"We'll sell you all of our\ngear, all of our stuff. \"It'll be a great deal.\" And the US is like, \"But isn't\nPanama a part of Colombia?\" And yes indeed, at the time, Panama was actually a part of Colombia. It was not an independent country. So the United States Congress is like, \"Okay, listen Philippe. \"We will buy you out of your canal project \"that you clearly failed on, \"but we will only do it\nif we can get approval \"from Colombia, who\nliterally owns this land.\" And Philippe is secretly like, \"Uh, there's no way that\nColombia is going to go for this. \"They're gonna reject the plan \"and then the US is gonna back out \"and I'm gonna lose all my money \"and I have to make this happen.\" Philippe was very\nserious about this canal. So this is where Philippe\nstarts to get really conniving to pull out all the stops\nto get the canal built. So he goes to the people who live in the region of Colombia\ncalled Panama, and he says, \"Hey guys, I know you've\nsorta been wanting \"to be independent from\nColombia for a long time. \"Bogota is so far away,\nthey don't care about you. \"You could be your own country. \"What if I, a French\nengineer, could guarantee \"your independence without a bloody war? \"Just leave the details to me. \"Make me your ambassador and\nI will make this happen.\" And the Panamanians are like,\n\"But dude, you're French.\" And he's like, \"Yeah yeah\nyeah, but you're Colombian, \"so why don't we team up in\nthe name of creating Panama, \"a new country?\" And they were like, \"Okay fine, Philippe. \"You're our representative,\nour ambassador now. \"Just give us the signal \"when we should rise up\nfor our independence, \"but you promise to make sure \"that Colombia's not gonna come\nin and quell our uprising.\" And Philippe's like, \"Yeah yeah\nyeah, I'll take care of it.\" Okay, before we keep\ngoing with this story, I want to tell you about\ntoday's sponsor, Policy Genius. About a month ago, I signed\nup for life insurance, something I knew nothing\nabout for a very long time, until I did and looked\ninto it and realized that being a responsible adult, I should probably have life insurance. It's something that's\nnot fun to think about, but is absolutely something\nthat feels good to have once you have it. Policy Genius is very simple. It takes a few minutes to sign up and makes it easy to compare quotes from over a dozen top\ninsurers all in one place. You could save 50% or\nmore on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policy Genius. You could have life insurance\nin less than a week. That's what happened to me. I didn't even have to\ngo to a doctor's office. One of the options was to just do a medical\nexam over the phone, and I was like, \"Yes please.\" It was a simple phone call. The Policy Genius team, they\ntook care of all the paperwork, they did all the complicated stuff that I would have no time to do, and before you know it, I\nhave a life insurance policy. So go to policygenius.com/johnnyharris, where you can learn\nabout different policies and which one fits your need. Then, when you're ready to apply, the Policy Genius team\nhandles everything after that for no extra cost. There's no extra fees. Policy Genius doesn't\nsell your information, which is, thank you\nPolicy Genius for that. Overall, this is the best\nway to compare quotes for life insurance and\nto get the best deal that fits for you. Again, I literally just\ndid this a month ago and it really was smooth and easy, and I sleep better at night\nknowing that I have a policy. So thank you Policy Genius\nfor sponsoring this video, for supporting my work and my channel. That link will be in my description. Now let's get back to the Panama Canal. So Philippe is now the\nambassador of the Panamanians, who are not a country yet, but he's still hoping\nthat maybe the Colombians will approve the plan. Philippe sort of has\nthis in his back pocket, this deal that he just\nmade with the Panamanians. He doesn't know if he has to use it yet. But back to the Americans having to ask Colombia for\napproval to build their canal. Sure enough, they show\nup and Colombia's like, \"No, go home. \"You guys are way too\naggressive around here lately. \"We're not interested. \"No canal, see you later.\" So the US goes to Philippe and they say, \"Sorry bro, the deal is off. \"Colombia said no. \"We said we'd only do\nthis if Colombia said yes. \"After all, Panama is a part of Colombia.\" And Philippe is like, \"Wait, hold on. \"I have a plan for this. \"I've been talking to the Panamanians \"and they want to break\naway from Colombia, \"and they made me their ambassador. \"I've even written them a new Constitution \"and designed them a new flag.\" Wait, Philippe, are\nyou a graphic designer? \"No, but I designed them a flag anyway. \"We can still make this\ncanal thing happen. \"All I need you guys to do\nis show up with your navy \"to make sure that the Panamanians \"can rise up for independence \"without Colombia coming\nto shut it all down.\" And the US Congress is like, \"Dude, you're nuts, see you later.\" But out of nowhere, the\nPresident at the time shows up and is like, \"Did somebody say\nstage a theatrical revolution \"to take over more land and\nincrease American power?\" Teddy was back on the scene. Teddy loves this kind of stuff. He loves the sort of backroom deals, \"Let's not ask for permission,\nlet's ask for forgiveness.\" This is Teddy Roosevelt's sweet spot. So Philippe has all of his ducks in a row. He's got Teddy Roosevelt on his side, he has Panamanians who\njust gave him approval to be their ambassador, and he's like, \"Let's do this.\" So in November 1903,\nPhilippe gives the nod to the Panamanians to rise up, to take over and declare\nthemselves independent. And at the same time, he\nsignals to Teddy Roosevelt to send in their big gun boats to sit off the coast of Panama to block Colombia from\nsending in reinforcements to put down this revolution\nby the Panamanians. And so Colombia is\nlike, \"Oh fine, take it. \"F you, America. \"You guys played real dirty there, okay? \"You know that? \"That was not cool.\" So just as Philippe orchestrated, Panama declares independence, and Philippe is the ambassador. The US is the first to\nrecognize them as a new country, and Teddy Roosevelt's\nlike, \"That was thrilling! \"Now what, Philippe?\" So Philippe is like, \"Let's\nmake a deal, America. \"I'm the official\nrepresentative of Panama now, \"as per my agreement with the Panamanians, \"so let's write a treaty\non behalf of Panama.\" So he travels to the United States and starts working on a treaty between the United States and Panama that would give the USA\nthe rights and sovereignty over this strip of land to build a canal. I mean, this series of events is insane. France fails to build a canal, so one French dude, an engineer, tries to redeem the whole thing by convincing the US to change\nthe location of their canal, and then creates a revolution and convinces the US to\nhelp back that revolution, so that he, a Frenchman,\ncan be the ambassador of the newly created country of Panama, and make a deal with the US. Whoa, Philippe. He was the one man band lobbyist who somehow finagled this whole situation. So Philippe and the Secretary\nof State of the United States draw up this treaty that\ngives the US total control over this strip of land for\nthem to build their canal. No Panamanians were in the room when they drafted this treaty. They gave no approval of this. This treaty was between the US and Panama, but really it was between the US and Philippe the French engineer. So now the US military shows up to Panama to claim this land that\nthey now see as theirs, and the Panamanians are like, \"Dude, WTF, what are you doing here?\" And the US is like, \"Oh,\nyou signed a treaty with us \"giving us all this land.\" And Panama's like, \"No we didn't.\" And then they're like,\n\"Oh wait, light bulb. \"Philippe! \"That's why he wanted\nto be our ambassador! \"I get it. \"Man, we got played by Philippe.\" And they totally did. So now the US is setting up shop in Panama to start digging their canal. (film strip rolling) The US picked up right\nwhere the French left off, using effectively the same\nroute that the French had dug during their seven years of misery. And speaking of misery,\nthe US was able to learn from the French's mistakes. They started using railways\nto truck out all the dirt, so that the mud wouldn't\nslide back into the canal, and they learned how to\ndrain the puddles of water so that it wasn't a haven for\ndisease infected mosquitoes. And most importantly, they\ndidn't try the crackpot idea of trying to dig a canal all\nthe way down to sea level. They went with the much better idea of digging the canal up high,\n26 meters above sea level, and using clever engineering\nto get ships up to that level. \"Like I said\", said that\none French engineer, and de Lesseps was like, \"No one asked you, get out of here.\" So after 10 years of construction and a visit by Teddy Roosevelt, who staged this amazing photo shoot of him wearing a Panamanian hat, sitting on one of the machines, all to boost morale to\nget this project done, after all of that, the\nUS completed this dream of slicing a water route through this 80 kilometer stretch of land. Philippe, at this point,\nis back in France, probably exhausted from\nall of his scheming, but ultimately very pleased\nthat he was able to pull it off. So the canal is done,\nand here's how it works. (water rushing) Remember that the land looks like this. You have the Pacific and Atlantic\nOceans here at sea level, and then the interior of the land being about 26 meters above sea level. So first, they built a dam on this river to create this giant lake, so that they have loads\nof water to work with. That's why we see those trees\nsticking up from the water, or why these hilltops turned into islands. Then they built these brilliant\ninventions called locks. The boat enters here at sea level. They enter into this chamber\nwhere there is a gate that is holding the water\nfrom the high up lake back. It's locked. But once the boat is in\nthis holding chamber, they let the water from\nhigher up come down, making the boat flow up. It takes about eight minutes\nfor the boat to rise. Then they move into the next chamber, where they do this again and again, until by the end of it,\nthe boat has been lifted up 26 meters above sea level. They then traverse the rest of this canal, going through the artificial\nlake and snaking through until they get to the other side, where now they need to\nget down to sea level. And they go through the same\nprocess, but in reverse. They finally make it down to sea level and they can exit onto\nnow a different ocean than when they started. It's honestly an engineering marvel, and it reshaped the\nglobal economic landscape, making it easier and safer\nto move goods and people around the world. And yeah, the US was very\nserious about controlling this little strip of land, this choke point that they had built. If you look at a map from\nthe early or mid 1900s, you're gonna see that\nthe Panama Canal zone was always marked as a\nsovereign part of the US. Controlling a choke point like this gives you strong strategic\nadvantage, and the US knew that. But the world would finally\ndecide that big powers shouldn't actually be able to swoop in and take over whatever land they want. - [Newscaster] The wind of\nchange is blowing up a gale in the Panama Canal zone, and citizens have to defend themselves as students and other\nrioters demanded the names of the 61 year old Canal Zone\nTreaty with the United States. - And the Panamanians in the\n1960s finally had enough, and they're like, \"Yeah,\nthis land is actually ours.\" So in the 60s and 70s, the\nPanamanians rose up in protest against this US occupation of the canal, and through a series of treaties,\nthey finally got it back. Officially on the last\nday of the millennium, December 31, 1999, they\nsigned the last treaty that returned sovereignty to Panama. And then Jimmy Carter\ngave a speech in Spanish. (Jimmy Carter speaking Spanish) I mean, he, he tried really\nhard, and I guess that matters. So today, the Panama Canal\nbelongs to Panamanians. It still uses the innovative\ntechnology from 100 years ago that allows this canal to be built 26 meters above sea level. But for all of the engineering innovation that's present here, to me, the more incredible\npart of this story is how this one Frenchman\norchestrated all of this. He played all the geopolitical forces at the time just right. He used Panamanians'\nthirst for independence and the Americans' thirst for\nimperialism and ocean power, all to make his dream\nof this canal happen. Oh, and to secure his financial\nreturn on the project. What a wild story. Thanks for watching. (light music)"

    "captions": "- My camera's not turning on. It's not turning on. (crowd murmuring) Okay. - Does this seem like a desert to you? (man laughing) It's ridiculous. (man laughing) (woman gasping) - Can you be a total asshole and still change the world for the better? I'm not actually sure about that question, but there's one guy who certainly seems like proof that you can, and you've probably never heard his name. - The most fascinating\ncharacter in American history I've never heard anything about. - And yes, that's John Green, an OG YouTuber and author\nof The Fault In Our Stars and Turtles All The Way Down, and someone who I am a giant fan of, and during this interview was\nsort of low-key freaking out. Anyway, John Green wrote a book with some very juicy\nand fascinating essays, link in the doobly-doo. And one of those essays is about this guy. - Clarence Saunders. (shutter clicking) - Yes, Clarence Saunders. Clarence Saunders changed everything, at least here in the United States. And to understand how, you have to understand grocery stores. (energetic old-time music) Specifically, what grocery stores used to look like a hundred years ago. Wait a minute. Before we go on, let me just tell you\nsomething really quickly. See this? Inside of this little case are earbuds that I've been using lately. And the earbuds are made by Raycon, who are the sponsor of today's video. These are called the Everyday Earbuds, and as the sun has been coming out, and as I've been sort of\ntrying to get back to normal, I've been exercising for\nthe first time in awhile, and going for runs. And when I go for runs,\nI listen to audiobooks. Is that a nerdy thing that I do? I listen to audiobooks when I go for runs. Anyway, these earbuds have been awesome. Unlike most of earbuds, they\ndon't fall out of my ears. I tend to have these like, big ear holes. And what I love about these\nEveryday Earbuds is that they come with different\nsized like, gel fittings. So I can just put the biggest ones on, and they actually like stick in my ear and they don't fall out. That's cool. The other thing is the battery\nlife is basically forever. Like, it's like 32 hours of battery life, which is a very long time. And they're like, really affordable. They're like, half the\nprice of premium earbuds that are out there. So they're affordable,\nthey sound really good, and they stay in my ears, and the battery lasts for a long time. So I've been going on runs, I've been listening to\naudiobooks with these earbuds, and I really like them. Raycon comes with a 45-day\nhappiness guarantee. Like, they're so confident that you're going to like these earbuds that they're just like,\nyeah, try them for 45 days, and we like, guarantee\nthat you'll be happy. So if you're interested in\neven looking into these, there's a link in my description, buyraycon.com/johnnyharris. Please use that link if you're\ngoing to go check these out. First off, you get 15% off of\nthese earbuds if you do that. And then also, it helps\nsupport this channel when you go to that link, so that Raycon knows that\nyou showed up to them through this video. There's also a card\nlike, up here somewhere that is that link, too. That is technology. We can put little cards in YouTube videos. Welcome to the future. Thank you, Raycon, for sending\nme these awesome earbuds and for supporting this channel and for sponsoring today's video. And let's get back to the story now. Clarence Saunders, what a man. - So my great grandfather's\ngrocery store in rural Tennessee was like almost every\ngrocery store in America. It was called a full\nservice grocery store. You walked in, there was a counter, you often handed the grocer list, and then the grocer would\ngo and get all of your food. And then they would weigh it\nall, and they would charge you, and often, you would pay\nback that grocery bill over time on credit. There were no aisles. Customers usually didn't pick brand names, so brand named food wasn't\nnearly as important as it is now. And also, highly processed packaged food wasn't nearly as important as it is now. - The first thing this\nguy, Clarence Saunders, did was he had an idea. - He would later like,\ntell the origin story of many different ways, but\none of the ways he told it, he would say, \"I was on a train, and like a bolt of lightning, the idea hit me for the\nfuture of American food.\" - [Announcer] A daily battle\nis being waged in supermarkets all over this country. A battle for the customer's dollar. - His concept for a grocery\nstore was a store with aisles where customers themselves\nwould walk through the aisles and pick their own food. There would be price tags on the food, which had never been the case before. And he would call this\ngrocery store Piggly Wiggly. - Wait, what? Piggly Wiggly? Piggly Wiggly, why? Wait, why? - That's a great question, Johnny. So one time, Saunders was asked about this and he answered that the name\nof the grocery store, quote, \"arrived from out of chaos\nand in direct contact with an individual's mind.\" Which maybe gives you a\nlittle bit of a concept of the sort of dude her was. - Some men just want to\nwatch the world burn. (Johnny laughing) - Oh, that is amazing. - But mostly, when people would ask, \"why call your grocery\nstore Piggly Wiggly,\" he would answer, \"so that people will ask that very question.\" - Man, this feels like\nthe Old Spice commercials. - [Woman] Pair Charmin\nFreshmates with your Char- - (yells) Old Spice body\nspray is too powerful to stay in its own commercial! - Yes.\n- We're going to just be like, so weird and crazy that like,\neveryone will be curious. - And a huge percentage\nof his advertising budget went to ads that were so weird. I mean, he called the third\nPiggly Wiggly Piggly Wiggly III because he felt that it was\nowed a certain royal dignity. I mean, it was very much\nlike the early 1920s and 30s version of the Old Spice ads. (Terry Crews yelling) - Okay, so Clarence Saunders\nbasically just disrupted the old way of grocery shopping. And as a consequence, a bunch of clerks, these people who used to\ndo the grocery shopping, lost their job. - My great grandfather's\ngrocery store closed as did many, many others. A lot of jobs were lost in this. And there was widespread\nfear about, you know, losing jobs to automation,\nlosing jobs to hyper-efficiency, which also, of course,\nforeshadows some current concerns. - Technology today could lead to 45% of current jobs disappearing. - But that doesn't make him an asshole. Like, there are people all\nthe time making businesses that people lose jobs on and\nwe sort of freak out about it, but it's actually better for the world. Oh, and he was pioneering\nnew ways of like, guerrilla marketing that made\npeople talk about him more, which is a really cool thing, too. It seems like this guy changed\nthe world for the better. And he did. But he also starts to give\nus signs of who he really is. - So even early on, there\nwere some indications that Saunders was a bully, that he could be very cruel to employees, that he could shortchange partners. And he was obsessed with growth, he was obsessed with making Piggly Wiggly as big as possible as fast as possible, taking over the entire world. In fact, even when Piggly Wiggly was a Memphis-only phenomenon\nin the very early days, he would put on the\nwindows outside the store, \"Piggly Wiggly: All Over The World.\" - So this gets to my question. As someone who is building\na startup right now and thinking a lot about\nbuilding a company, I genuinely have this question. Do you really need to be the\nmean bully founder and boss to make a world-changing business? We'll try to answer that\nquestion in a little bit, but first, I got to tell you the next part of the Clarence Saunders story. Because it's just too good not to tell. (soft percussion music) - This is where we start to see a lot of the negatives\nof Clarence Saunders. He became obsessed with trying to prove these Wall Street speculators wrong. And as he lost control of the business, he became more and more\nangry and vitriolic and really hateful. He wrote about this, at\ntimes, quite beautifully. Like, once he wrote, \"they have\nit all, everything I built, the greatest stores of\ntheir kind in the world, but they didn't get the man\nthat was father to the idea. They have the body of Piggly Wiggly, but they didn't get the soul.\" And I just love that. I mean, how much do you\nhave to believe in yourself to be like, \"I am the\nsoul of this company.\" So his next idea isn't quite the same as the original Piggly Wiggly. It's actually much closer to\ncontemporary grocery stores because there are still aisles where people pick out a\nlot of their own food, but there are also staffed counters for the deli department\nand for the bakery. As he's developing this new idea, he wants to call the\ngrocery store Saunders. Because of course he does. But the people who own\nPiggly Wiggly are like, \"no, no, no, no, no.\" You are not allowed to use your name in selling a grocery store because that would be a direct\ncompetitor to Piggly Wiggly, and that is a violation of our agreements. And in response, Clarence Saunders decides to call his new grocery store the Clarence Saunders Sole\nOwner Of My Name grocery store. - Oh my gosh, it's so good. It's like, I didn't\nrealize you could one-up this sort of self-centeredness and like, snarkiness of this guy.\n- Yes, yes. - And then it's like, again, he's doing this to his business. Like, this is what is going\nto be out there to the world, and yet he's using it as\nhis like, personal ego-fest. I love it. - But that's a lot of what we see with 21st century capitalism too, is these highly charismatic\nindividual founders who are really lifted up as\nthe centerpiece of the company, that it's not about the\n75,000 or 200,000 employees working together on a project. It's about this one god man, you know? Almost always a man. - My question is now for you as a person who's grown businesses and has led people, and I'm in this now more and more as I grow like, a startup and stuff. And like, Clarence Saunders\nwas obviously very successful. Like, timing might've\nbeen a little bit off, but like, he was very\nsuccessful in disrupting and changing things\nand building a business that still exists today. Do you have to be an asshole to like, build big businesses in\nthe capitalistic system? Like, is that a prerequisite to like, be hyper successful, in your mind? - I'm not sure. I was on a phone call once\nwith a very successful entrepreneur person. And he said to me, \"you're\ntoo loyal to your people and not loyal enough to your product.\" And my feeling about that was well, if that's the side that\nwe're going to err on, that's the side I would prefer to err on. Like, I believe in humans\nmaking stuff together. I don't really believe in the\nidea of these sui generis, brilliant individuals who\nreshape history on their own. I mean, the truth is, like\nalmost every successful person, Clarence Saunders was a\nbubble on the tide of empire, as Robert Penn Warren put it. He was riding a wave that was\nmuch, much larger than him. And, I mean, he was a very bright guy, but I think that in the end, that obsession with growth at all costs, that obsession with, you\nknow, winning, it ruined him. I mean, he died a poor man in a sanitarium for mentally ill people. He alienated almost everyone\nwho loved him in his life. And I don't think that's\nthe hero's journey. (calm music)"

    "title": "How China Conquered The Keyboard",
    "video_id": "hBDwXipHykQ",
    "captions": "- [Narrator] There's no Chinese alphabet. Instead, each word is represented\nby a symbol or character. (air whooshing) - How on Earth did a language\nwith tens of thousands of characters fit onto this keyboard? - [Narrator] Here is a\nworld of communication, tailored for your needs\nof today and tomorrow. - [Narrator] What really accounts\nfor China's meteoric rise as a major global power? - This is Shenzhen. It's a city in the south of China. I've actually been there. But back in the 1980s, this was just a sleepy fishing village with less than, like 100,000 people. Today, it is home to 12.5 million people, a giant metropolis with huge buildings and home to some of the\nlargest tech companies on the planet. This city is emblematic of\nChina's technological rise over the last 40 years. It's an explosion in\ntechnology and development that has really never happened\nbefore in human history. From an agrarian society to\na technological powerhouse in just a couple of decades. - That's fast. - This almost didn't happen. China almost didn't become\nthe technological powerhouse. And what held them back is something I have thought about a lot, which is this keyboard. This keyboard has like, 80 or so keys, and the Chinese language has like tens of thousands of characters. So how did they fit their\nlanguage onto this keyboard? To answer that question, you have to dive deep into modern China, into Chairman Mao, into the divide between\nTaiwan and mainland China, who despite speaking the same language use very different typing methods, all because of geopolitics. It's a story of how China took a keyboard that was developed for a vastly\ndifferent language system and mastered it, mastered it better than we did here in the West. It's a fascinating story\nof culture and history and technology, and I\nwant to share it with you. - [Narrator] Here is China. - [Narrator] It's become a keystone of national economic policy. - [Narrator] A large part\nof China's population lives in large cities. - [Narrator] I really\ndon't quite understand everything that's happening. (upbeat music) - To understand how Chinese\nspeakers type on a keyboard like this, I talk to my friend Mangle Kuo, who's currently in quarantine in Taiwan. - I just came back and quarantine in Taiwan's quarantine hotel. - Oh, my gosh. Wow. Mangle has lived in both China and Taiwan. He's technologically savvy\nand helped me understand how people type, not\njust on their keyboard but on their phone. - So basically growing up\nas a Chinese or Taiwanese, you have to learn how to\nwrite those characters. That's kind of the first thing first. And then you learn the, like\nthe pronunciation system behind all the characters. And in China, that's pinyin,\nand in Taiwan, that's zhuyin. - So let's break this down. Most languages are\nwritten with an alphabet. Each letter in that\nalphabet represents a sound. And when you string those sounds\ntogether, you make a word. It seems so intuitive as if like this is the only way to do it. But in Chinese, - There's another way. - Chinese uses complex\ncharacters for each word, so every word is a character. Each one of these characters\nrepresents a different thing, an object, the feeling, a concept, a verb. All in all, there're\nupwards of 70 or 80 thousand of these characters. This system was just fine. It worked in China for a really long time because you can use a brush\nor a pen to write stuff out. - I like that. It's like if\nit ain't broke, don't fix it. - This is the qwerty keyboard. It's called the qwerty keyboard because I mean, just look at it. This is the mechanism to which\npeople not just communicate with each other, but code the world, the software and programs\nthat we all use all the time. When this started to take\nover, China had a real problem. Listen, I need to just pause\nto tell you about something which is that investing\nmoney is hard, sometimes. And honestly, I'm like in my\n30s now and I just sort of learning the art of\ninvesting and not really. The sponsor of today's video\nis the company called Acorns. What they do is they allow you\nto get started with investing with really small amounts\nof money to begin with. And they make it so that you\ncan take your spare change from any transaction and\nautomatically invest it in the background. So as you go about your day,\nlike spending money on things it automatically invest\ninto diversified portfolios that experts manage, so that\nyou can actually start building an investment portfolio\nlike in the background and without a ton of money. It's an app that allows\nthis all happen very easily. Acorns is a financial awareness\napp that makes it easy to save and invest every day\nin the background of like, starting with just spare\nchange, no expertise required. You can set up an Acorns\naccount in like three minutes and start with just five dollars. You don't need a giant chunk\nof cash to start investing. And it's not just investing. You can also set up your\npersonal check-in account and your retirement\naccount all in this one app that you have access to. You get this heavy metal\ndebit card that is the card that when you swipe and it\nrounds up every transaction and invest those cents\ninto your portfolio. You can even get it customer engraved so you have a suite debit\ncard that works by the way, at tens of thousands of ATM\nmachines around the country with no fees. It's a\npretty darn good deal. So there's a link at my description. It's accorns.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link, help\nsupport that channel. But it also gives you a\n10-dollar bonus investment when you sign up. So you can sign up and\nstart having 10 dollars in your portfolio. Overall, I believe in\nstarting early with investing and Acorns is a fantastic\nway to get started with minimal effort and not a\nton of money to get started. But you can just do it in the background. It's a fantastic way. So thank Acorns for sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the story. They had to figure out\nhow to fit this onto this, and fast, because the world of computing started to explode in the\n70s, and 80s, and 90s. - Hello, I'm Bill Gates. - Here in the United\nStates, the qwerty keyboard was a very natural tool. We were able to use our\nalphabet and our symbols that we all are very used to, to develop programming languages so that we can make software. And soon, more and more\ncomputers were showing up into American homes. (pop songs from the '80s) - [Narrator] The Commodore\n64 now in a family pack. - Meanwhile on the other\nside of the planet, China, a country of\nalmost a billion people only had 3000 computers\nin the entire country. They were so far behind the West when it came to computer literacy. The Chinese government\nbegins to freak out. And it's like, guys we're\ngetting absolutely destroyed by the West because of\nthis whole computer thing, and you're telling me that\nis because we can't fit our language onto this keyboard? Are you kidding me? What\nwe're gonna do about it? So the Chinese government\nmade this a huge priority. And they finally started to\ndevelop somethings that worked. (door opening) - I got it. (audience laughing) - The first major system of\ntyping used the qwerty keyboard to build the shape of the characters. - We call it Cangjie. - Cangjie, and it was\npretty darn complicated. - It's basically like, puzzles. - Like Legos. - Yeah, kind of, like a brick.\nYou just put them together. I can write basic characters using that. - The system was clever\nbut it was complicated and not very fast at first. Luckily, China had a\nwild card up its sleeve that will help get Chinese speakers typing on a qwerty keyboard. It had to do with this guy, Chairman Mao. - [Narrator] The great\nChinese Chairman Mao Zedong. - History time, here we go. - [Narrator] The Communist\nParty's propaganda machine portrays the Chairman's Great Leap Forward as a dazzling success. - Mao was really bullish\nabout modernizing China. And one of his pet project was scrapping the entire Chinese character\nsystem and replacing it with a Western-style alphabet\nthat sounds out Chinese words, sort of like how we sound out our English or Italian or Spanish words. Now it was like learning\nthousands of Chinese characters is hard and complicated so\nwhy don't we just have a Latin or Romanized alphabet like\nthe rest of the world. So by 1949, Mao was like ready\nto roll, scrapping the entire Chinese writing system in\nthe name of a Roman alphabet. But then, one of its close buddies, former Communist dictator\nJoseph Stalin, convinced Mao not to totally kill off\nthe Chinese characters. Stalin was like, dude, don't,\ndude you're gonna regret it. And Mao was like, fine. So he kept the Chinese characters\nas the main writing system but for teaching literacy in\nschool, he developed a written alphabet called pinyin. - Pinyin, P-I-N-Y-I-N. - Where you can use the Roman letters to spell out Chinese words\nby the way that they sound. So right now you're\ntyping out this sentence in Romanized charcters in the way that it would be\nphonetically spelt in Roman, like \"wo\" is W-O, right? - Yes. - Okay. So you typed it all out, - Yeah. - and down there it renders it, okay. Wow. So now if you want to\nwrite the word \"beef\", which is \"niu-rou\". - How to say \"beef\"? - I think \"niu-rou\". - \"NIU-ROU\" - I've no idea, \"niu-rou\", \"niu\". - \"NIU-ROU\" - \"R-rao, niu-rao\". I've no idea. Instead of memorizing these\ncharacters which means \"beef\", you can just spell it\nout by the way it sounds. This romanization of Chinese,\nagain it's called pinyin would become really helpful years later when the Chinese government\nis trying to figure out how to get people to type\non Western computers. But wait a minute. We can't go on before we mention a little bit of geopolitics. (canon firing) Okay, it's 1940s. Mao and his Communist\nrevolutionaries are taking over mainland China in a bloody\nrevolution and civil war. And the Chinese government\nthat they overthrow and are fighting with, end\nup losing and retreating to an island nearby called\nTaiwan to continue with their non-Communist version of China. And they both think that\nthey're the real China and they start this war\nthat has never stopped and they're still fighting this war and they both think they're China. Anyway, that's absolutely\na story I want to tell but I'm not going there. Now again blinders, we're\ntalking about qwerty keyboards. - If we're trying to figure something out, now we need to focus, okay? - So you have this \"two\nChinas\", the Communist one, and the non-Communist one. Mao is pushing the Romanized alphabet in the Communist version of China. And Taiwan is like, no, this\nRomanized pinyin thing is an invention of the Communist\nParty, and a total sell-out of the Chinese traditional\nwriting system, no way. But Taiwan is secretly like, we loved the idea of\nhaving an alphabet for our Chinese language because it made it a lot\neasier to teach literacy. So they adopted an alphabet,\nbut it's not the pinyin, Romanized alphabet. It is an old alphabetic\nsystem that was developed in the early 1900s. - It's zhuyin. They did it before pinyin. They're completely\nnewly-invented a set of symbols for this purpose. - Wow. That is wild. So because they hated\ntheir Communist enemies, Taiwan rejected the Romanized\nalphabet that Mao was pushing and stuck with this traditional alphabet that had been developed\na few years earlier. And that's still how it is today. (woman speaking Chinese) So this gets to a pretty\nsatisfying answer to the question of this entire video which is how do Chinese speakers\ntype on a qwerty keyboard. The answer is, if you go to mainland China you're going to see keyboards like this. People in mainland China use\nthis keyboard to type out the sounds of their words,\nand the computer takes that and renders it into Chinese characters. If you live in Taiwan,\nyou'll see a keyboard that looks more like this, but you basically do the same thing. Use these characters to type\nout the sounds of the word and the computer will render\nit into a Chinese character. Both of these are new writing systems that were developed in the past 100 years to help Chinese speakers\nspell out their words and move away from a\ncharacter-based system. - [Narrator] Now what are the key features that you think should\nbe in an ideal laptop. - [Woman] Standby for the\nsoftware transmission. Better start your recorder now. - Okay, back to our timeline here. It's the '80s and '90s. China\nis starting to really adopt technology and they're\nusing these typing methods to use the qwerty keyboards\nto actually participate in the computing world. But they're still lagging so\nfar behind the Western world. They're way slower in their\ntyping so the Chinese government went back to the drawing\nboards and was like, how can we make it faster. And boy, they found a solution in the '80s that will change everything. (woman speaking Chinese) And this is the work that's\nkind of juicy, in my opinion. This is the part that\nis like, I don't know, really helps me to understand\nhow people type today. You know when you go to Google and you start typing a sentence, and it fills out the rest\nof the sentence for you, or even on Gmail these\ndays, like I'll be typing and suddenly it'll like\npredict what I want to say. It's pretty cool. It's not life-changing. It's sort of like saves\nme maybe a couple of milliseconds every day. In China, this technology\nof predictive text, predictive typing, was life-changing because regardless of what method you use to start building your\ncharacters in the computer, the computer now starts to guess what characters you want to type. For example, let's say someone\nis using one of these systems that we're gonna use to\nbuild these characters, and they type this character. This is the root of a Chinese\nword and it means \"water\". The computer sees this and says, okay, you just typed \"water\". There's a bunch of\ncharacters that are derived from this root, this \"water\" root. For example, here's the one for \"river\" or maybe you actually want this one which is the word for \"wash\". So if you just type water,\nyou can look at these options and decide which one you want. This was an algorithmic,\npredictive typing system that was happening in\nthe late 1980s in China, three whole decades\nbefore anything similar surfaced in the West. And it is this technology\nof predictive text that changed everything for China. - [Narrator] Before computers,\nthere was no practical way to type the thousands of\ncharacters called kanji. To deal with the complexity\nof these symbol words different systems have been adopted. - They started to refine\nthis algorithm to make it more and more clear that\nas soon as you start typing anything, the algorithm says, do you want to do this,\nor this, or this, or this? I mean I've been watching a\ngreat deal of competitions, typing competitions. (woman speaking Chinese) This is the thing in China, and if you zoom in and look\nclosely at this competition, you'll see that as soon as\nthese competitors start typing a pop-up box comes up, giving them an algorithmically\ngenerated menu of options that predicts what they're trying to type. So typing in Chinese is as\nmuch about choosing from this predictive menu as it\nis about pressing the keys. It is a combination of both. And this competition has\npushed developers to make better and better predictive algorithms so that people can\ncommunicate very efficiently using the keyboard. So how fast are these\npeople typing right now? Well, the average English\nspeaker can type at around 43 words per minute. I work on a computer all day\nso I'm probably more like 60, 65 words per minute. There is an English typing\ncompetition in Las Vegas and the typists here are\nmind-blowing 163 words per minute. But if you head back to these\nguys, these people are typing at a score of 242 words per minute, four times faster than I can type, and almost double what\nthey're typing in English at the best competition in Las Vegas. Whoa! - Wow, that's fast. - Yeah, it's fast. - So China used this technology that was developed in the West mainly designed for languages that are very different than Chinese, and they mastered it, but guess what? The Chinese government still\nhas the need for speed. They're like, how can we make it faster? So predictive typing in China\nwent from letting you start a character and predicting what character you want to choose, to then going to seeing\nwhat character you just put and predicting the next one, the next word in the sentence\nthat you want to say. And now in the last few years they're pushing it to the next level, which is Cloud-based predictive texting. - A cloud? - Again, the closest thing\nwe have in the West is like the Google Auto-complete. You go to this search engine. You start typing and the Internet is like, a lot of people are searching this so we think you're searching this, too. But imagine, instead of\njust a search engine, imagine this concept for everywhere. As you're typing your WORD documents, as you're texting your mom, anywhere in the digital\nspace that is connected to the Internet is now\nfeeding you sentences that they think maybe you want to say based on an AI-generated\nweb of information of what everyone else is texting,\nand emailing and writing. So an example of this, let's say that there's\na Chinese movie star that just got into a big car accident. It's all over the news and\neverybody is talking about it. You've never typed this\nmovie star's name before but as soon as you do start typing it your phone starts talking to the Cloud and not just the Internet but\nother people's text messages. So then the algorithm says that I think you probably want to text\nabout this movie star and the car accident. And this seems like a great\ntime-saving technology that helps Chinese speakers type. - It's a good idea. - But just imagine some scenarios here. Let's say that you're not writing about a movie star and the car accident. But let's say instead you\nare texting a friend about June 4th 1989, Tiananmen Square. - [Narrator] The noise of gunfire rose from all over the center of Peking. - [Narrator] China is a\nnation at war with itself. - There's one major company\nthat owns the software. This one company determines most of what shows up in predictive text. And in a country where there's\nnot a lot of hesitation to control citizens'\naccess to information, it's not far-stretched to\nsee how subtle manipulation can start to occur with\nthis Cloud-predictive text. Algorithm deciding sort\nof what should go next. For example, if you type\nin \"Taiwan is China\", the algorithm will suggest to you \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China\". Anyway, this is not a\nmajor problem right now. And I'm not saying that the\ngovernment is manipulating every individual in China\nwith predictive text. All I'm saying is that, the\nstory of how Chinese speakers have been able to type\non the qwerty keyboard is the story of really clever and amazing technological advancements, and a huge part of that has\nbeen predictive algorithms. And all I'm saying is that\nalgorithmically presented information can lead to\nsome dangerous outcomes in terms of making people\nthink a certain way. But at the end of the day, let\nus just end on the fact that China has developed a\nreally amazing technology for getting their language\ninto the computer, and by doing so, have been able to pass\nany typist in the West, helping fuel the rise of China as a technological powerhouse. (mysterious music) That's the story here and\nI really learned a lot. Thank you all for watching.\nI will see you soon. And thanks for being here."

    "captions": "(Johnny breathes heavily) (soft music) - There is a cluster of 7,000 islands that looks like one of the\nmost beautiful places on earth. People have been living here\nfor over 30,000 thousand years, traveling between these islands, trading with each other\nand with the region, and developing religion,\nidentity, and culture. It eventually became\na country called Ma'I. And while all of these\nadvancements were happening here on these islands, another group of humans had been evolving in\nanother part of the world, over here in Europe. (techno music) But this other group\nhad a different culture, a different religion. Many of their advancements were achieved through expansion, not collaboration. And their religion thrived\nwhen they stomp out others. They wanted to conquer. This island, these people, this culture would soon be swallowed, stripped of what made them, them. And soon, their name would be changed, after the name of the\nKing of their conquerors. This isn't a story just\nabout a big powerful military taking over new lands. We know that story pretty well. The story of these people\noffers a new perspective to anyone who will listen. It's a perspective that has being wiped from our history books, because of the inherent\ndiscomfort and tension with this fact that the United States, once a colony that heroically\nthrew off an empire to become independent, soon became an empire itself. It contradicts our\nfounding belief that it is, quote, self-evident that\nall men are created equal. And this story isn't just history. That empire still exists today, with colonial possessions and subjects. It's all wrapped up in the story of these 7,000 islands and their people. So, I wanna tell you the story of how the US stole the Philippines. - There are still American citizens today who do not have equal voting rights. These are citizens of\nAmerica's island territory. (upbeat music) - The US Constitution grants a citizenship to everyone born on US soil except in one jurisdiction. - Quick pause, because I wanna tell you about something that is important to me and happens to also be the\nsponsor of today's video, which is BetterHelp. I'm a big believer in therapy. I've been in therapy for\nalmost two years now. And it has changed my life. For many years, I didn't\nthink therapy was for me. I thought it was for everyone else. And so, I sort of avoided it. But when I finally\nstarted going last year, I really started to realize\nthat there was so much that I could be working\non day in and day out that could dramatically reshape how I think about the world, and ultimately make me more happy. BetterHelp is a platform that is trying to make therapy more accessible to people. It's a virtual platform. So you have access not\njust to the therapists that are in your town, but to a huge network of\n15,000 thousand therapists. So you can find the right fit for you. Finding the right therapist\nis sometimes difficult. And with BetterHelp, you can, for free, switch to a new therapist\nas many times you need to until you find the right fit. Your therapist is in touch with you. You can message them right in the app throughout the week if needed. And it is an affordable\nand approachable way to get in on therapy whenever you want. And BetterHelp is available worldwide. Anywhere in the world that you are, that has an internet connection, you can get in on counseling. This isn't a crisis line. This is a professional\ncounseling and therapy by certified professional therapists. Therapy can be expensive. And with BetterHelp, it is more affordable than traditional therapy, and they even offer\nfinancial aid when needed. So they really are trying to\nmake this more accessible, which is something I deeply believe in. I think that in our culture, we don't value therapy\nenough, and we really should because I think all of us\nhave stuff we can work on. Thank you BetterHelp for\nsupporting this channel, for sponsoring this video. There's a link in my description. It is betterhelp.com/johnnyharris. Going to that link will give\nyou 10% off your first month of BetterHelp, if you\nwant to get started today. So, let's get back to the video. This video could be called how\nSpain stole the Philippines, since Spain was the\nfirst nation to conquer and control these islands 500 years ago. Actually, exactly 500 years ago. And indeed, Spain left\na very deep influence on these islands, not\nleast of the name itself, which is named after King Philip. Spain brought their religion,\ntheir language, their culture, which is why the most common last names in the Philippines are\nlike Reyes or Del Rosario, De la Cruz, De los Santos. But the heyday of the\nSpanish empire came and went. And by the 1800s, it\nwas kind of crumbling. But it was the arrival of a new superpower that I believe had a bigger imprint, not just on the Philippines,\nbut on the US itself. It established rules and behaviors that we still grapple with today. And that's why this is the story of how the US stole the Philippines. So let's go. - [News Anchor] To this\nday, we can see the traces of the almost 400 hundred\nyears of Spanish rule over the Philippines. But even more striking is\nthe more recent influence of the United States. - Okay, so it's the end of the 1800s. Up until now, US expansion\nsort of looks like this. It's all happening on this mainland. And at this point, there\nsort of became a big debate of, do we keep going? Some people wanted to\nkeep expanding the US outside of this mainland. The President at the time\nwasn't a big expansion guy but he was surrounded\nby people who loved war, specifically this guy. And these people who\nsurrounded the President had their eye on this Spanish colony, right off the American coast called Cuba, where the locals were\nrising up against Spain. (suspenseful music) Wait a minute, isn't this a\nvideo about the Philippines? Why are we talking about Cuba? We're getting there in\njust a second, okay? So anyway, Cuba. Americans didn't wanna\ngo to war with Cuba. They're like, we don't need more war. But thanks to the explosion of an American submarine in Cuba, which was probably an accident, and thanks to some highly\nunethical journalism that blamed the explosion on Spain, and a big thanks to again\nthis guy, Teddy Roosevelt, who at this point was just a peon, he was literally the assistant\nsecretary of the Navy, but he somehow cajoled his boss's boss, the President of the United States, to go to war in Cuba to\nliberate the Cubans from Spain. So the US declared war on Spain in 1898. But this begins a new era\nof war in the United States. No longer can you just go into\nwar and just take over land. You need an angle. You need to sell the war\nto the American people. So the angle on this war was liberation. We're liberating the people. - The people you liberate\nwill witness the honorable and decent spirit of\nthe American military. - No, no, no, that's later. We're talking about 1898. But, yes, the whole idea of selling war to the American public didn't\nreally go away after this. Why did the US go to war in Iraq? - [Pres. Bush] In the early\nstages of military operations... - So anyway, the US is\nnow at war with Spain, which is an empire that\nis deeply in decline, as I mentioned. It's not gonna be hard to win. But soon, it's not just Cuba. The US, really meaning, Teddy Roosevelt, who again is just an assistant\nsecretary of the Navy, he's not a big decision maker, he somehow maneuvers the situation to say, let's liberate\nnext door Puerto Rico, and while we're at it,\nlet's go into the Pacific and liberate Guam and the\nPhilippines from Spain as well. Teddy didn't even ask his boss to do this. He literally sent off a cable\nto the Navy Commander in Asia that was George Dewey,\ngo attack the Philippines where Spain is, that is\nwhat your mandate is. And George Dewey is like, okay. I've been told to go to war\nwith Spain in the Philippines. Teddy was sort of the mind like, better to ask forgiveness than permission. I mean, I get that but, kind of nuts that he pulled it off. Anyway, and now, because\nof Teddy Roosevelt, who we literally named the\nTeddy Bear after, side note, we are at war not in the Caribbean only, but also in the Pacific. The US arrives to the Philippines and sees that the locals\nhad already been fighting against the Spanish for years. The Spanish were weak and\nwere totally declining. So it's like the top of the ninth inning or like the fourth quarter of the Spanish in the Philippines. And the US shows up and is\nlike, let us liberate you. And the Philippines were like, well, we've sort already\nbeen fighting this bloody war for years against the Spanish, so yeah, I guess, United States,\nif you wanna come help us deal the final blow to Spain, like, sweet. So George Dewey, this Navy Commander, and his fleet show up to Manila. Meanwhile, back in the US, people are like, wait,\nweren't we just supposed to invade Cuba? What are we doing in the Philippines now? And the US government is like, because the Philippines is a perfect hub for commercial opportunities in Asia, and we think that if we don't take it Japan or Germany might take it, which will clearly diminish\nour geostrategic advantage in the Pacific. No, they didn't say that. They said, we want to liberate the people of the Philippines, liberate. - The people you liberate\nwill witness the honorable and decent spirit of\nthe American Military. - So the Spanish see the US arrive to the Philippines and were\nlike, great, we're done. So the Spanish Military\nCommanders asked to meet with the US military commanders. They meet in secret, and Spain is like, listen, I know we're losing\nbut we really wanna save some face here. We don't want to look like we lost to the Filipino revolutionaries. And I'm not kidding, the\nSpanish Commander literally said that he would, quote,\nbe willing to surrender to white people but not to the Filipinos. So the US Commander is like, okay, there's an opportunity here. We said we were here to\nliberate the Filipinos, but we haven't promise anything yet, so we would much rather look\nlike the US defeated Spain instead of help the\nFilipinos defeat Spain, much better for our brand,\nsays the United States. So together, the United\nStates and Spanish militaries organized a fake battle, a fake battle in which the\nUS would fight the Spanish in Manila and the Spanish\nwould intentionally lose. And the climax of this\nwhole theatrical battle, according to the plan,\nwas that at the end, the US would storm towards the\ninner walled city of Manila, the last stronghold of\nwhere the Spanish are. Oh, and the key detail in this whole plan, they would not let the Filipino fighters, the ones that have been\ndoing all the actual fighting against the Spanish,\njoin them as they stormed towards the walled city\nto deal the final blows to the Spanish empire. And this would mean that the Filipinos technically didn't gain\ntheir independence. It was actually the US\nwho conquered the Spanish. And then the Spanish are like, oh, can you give us 20 million\ndollars for our troubles. And the U.S was like, yeah, sure. So now the US wins the\nwar and they claimed sovereignty over the Philippines. So yeah, this happened. They did the fake battle. They won the war. Instead of liberating the Filipinos, they just said, hey,\nwe're your new colonizers. Psych. Meanwhile, back in the United States, they gotta keep up this white\nsavior liberation narrative that they created to justify\ngoing to war with Spain. So you see a lot more\ntheatrical PR by the government. They staged this giant military\nparade in New York City, where this military Commander\nwho did the fake war, George Dewey, marches down. They called it Dewey Day. It was like a two day\nparade in New York City. They created a big military arch for him. He became a military\nhero for having liberated all these people from the Spanish. And then you start to see\nthese crazy advertisements, like the soap advertisement that has George Dewey, the\nCommander, washing his hands, with the caption, quote,\nthe first step towards lightening the white man's burden is through teaching the\nvirtues of cleanliness. And on the side, you have\nsoap being off-loaded in the Philippines and\nbeing given to the locals. The US had to frame this not as conquest, but as the honorable duty of the US to civilize these people, or in the words of the soap ad, quote, to brighten the\ndark corners of the earth. Geez, this is insane, and\nwas not that long ago. Okay, so this is where\nthings really heat up. It's 1900 now, Spain\nloses the war, obviously. And the US now owns Puerto Rico, Guam, and they claim the Philippines. But the local Filipinos,\nwho have been fighting for their freedom for years are like, no, no, no, no, you just waltzed\nin here, on our rebellion, and conspired with the Spanish to make it look like\nyou were liberating us. No, this is our country, we\ndon't need another colonizer. And this is where things really heat up. (upbeat music) The Filipinos start fighting\nagain for their independence. And this time, against the United States. It is a pretty horrible bloody war, one that I've never\nlearned about in school. It include massacres of\nmen, women, and children by the United States,\nand hundred of thousands of civilian deaths. But the US eventually won and\nthey established a government in the Philippines. Back in the US, the appetite for expansion continued to go down,\nand people sort of just forgot about the Philippines. They forgot that there was a war there. One newspaper summed it up by saying, Americans didn't know if the Philippines were islands or canned fruit. But the fact remained\nthat the US went to war and now owned the Philippines, in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam. So this begged a very important question, one that hadn't been\nasked before, which is, is all of this land America? Are these people Americans? This was a huge question. And the answer to that questions affects how we see these\nterritories still today. Okay, so a few years after these wars, there's a guy in New York\nCity who's importing oranges from one of these\nterritories, Puerto Rico. And he's paying tariffs on these imports because that's what you do\nwhen you're importing oranges from another country. Wait a minute, another country? This guy was like, didn't\nwe conquer Puerto Rico, and Guam, and the Philippines? Isn't that America? The Constitution says\nthat you can't put tariffs on stuff coming from\nother parts of the US. Like New Jersey can't put tariffs on avocados from California. So he sued and his case, and\na bunch of others like it, made it to the Supreme Court. So now the Supreme Court must decide. Is this land, where we just won a war, is this America? Are these Americans? If they are, do they\nget all the same rights as other Americans? Do they get to vote? Do they get to participate\nin the US economy without tariffs? Like any other state does? And honestly, this isn't a question about oranges and tariffs. The real question at stake here is, is America the land of the free, where all are created equal? Or are we an empire? No different than any other empire that scoops up colonial\npossessions in war, and rules the people, who\nare usually black and brown, as subjects, not fully\na part of the country. That was the question that was at stake. And in these series of\ncases in the early 1900, the Supreme Court decided that America was the latter, is the latter. They created a new category of land called unincorporated territories,\nwhere the people don't have any representation\nin the democracy, but where Congress can\ncreate laws on their own, particularly laws dealing with revenue, which would not be allowed\nby the Constitution for states within the Union. We can create revenue\nlaws, except that's totally unconstitutional for other\nparts of our country. In other words, unincorporated territories are land we control and\nexploit for revenue, but whose people don't get to vote and don't get the right to trial by jury. So, yeah, the Philippines,\nin addition to Puerto Rico and Guam, remained\nunincorporated territories, a place that the US could just ignore without a lot of consequence. They weren't important\nenough or strategic enough to be considered to become\nstates, like Hawaii or Alaska. So they sort of faded from\nAmerican consciousness. Like, this is why we never\nheard about this in school, it didn't make it into the\nhistory books in any salient way. And how far the Philippines\nhad faded from people minds became very clear in December\nof 1941, during World War II. The US had owned the\nPhilippines for like 40 years when a fleet of Japanese\nbombers flew across the Pacific and bombed an American\nnaval base in Hawaii. - [Narrator] And the severe\nbombing of Pearl Harbor by the enemy's planes\n(indistinct) Japanese. But what we don't really\nremember is on that day, Japan bombed Guam and the Philippines, two American territories,\nas well as several other American and British territories. - Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy. - Here is the draft of this speech. This is the original draft that FDR spent the day marking\nup before he gave it. Zoom-in a little bit and\nyou'll see on this draft that it mentioned the\nPhilippines originally. But FDR crossed it out. He crossed out the mention of Manila. Yes, the Philippines was\non some map somewhere. Yes, we technically owned it. But the people really\ndidn't want to hear about it because these people weren't Americans. The Supreme Court had decided that. They weren't gonna become\nstates anytime soon, so why mention them? After that day, Japan actually full-on invaded the Philippines. They didn't do that to Hawaii. But they did to the Philippines,\nuntil the end of the war. At which point, the Philippines were finally granted independence in 1946. Fast forward to today, and this we own you, but you're not\nreally Americans precedent, established by the Supreme Court, still applies to four million people who live in unincorporated territories. Or let's just call a spade a spade, let's call them what they are. These are colonial possessions. The people who lived here don't experience the full rule of law, they\ndon't get trial by jury, they don't have full\nrepresentation in our democracy, and they don't get to\nvote for the President. This is why when a\nhurricane hits Puerto Rico, the government response is\nnot nearly what it should be. The way Trump talked about Puerto Rico as almost another country,\nas not a part of us, mirrors exactly how the Supreme Court talked about this\nunincorporated territories. They're for revenue, not to\ncompete with American farmers. We conquered these places,\nbut we didn't wanna bring the people fully into\nthe American project. We left them out. And there, they remain today. (soft music)"

    "captions": "- Hey real quick, I want to\nsay thank you to Storyblocks who's the sponsor of today's video. I've used Storyblocks for like\nthe better part of a decade, because it is a giant repository\nof visual and audio assets that I can use for my videos. You may not know this, but in this video that you're watching, I've used a bunch of Storyblocks footage, because I just go there all the time to download an unlimited amount of high res royalty-free stock footage. And I don't pay for each individual clip, I just pay one subscription\nand I get unlimited downloads. Storyblocks has not only stock footage, but also After Effects\ntemplates and sound effects. It is a giant repository of\namazing visual and audio assets. And again, I've been using them long before they ever came\nto sponsor a video for me because I love Storyblocks. So thank you Storyblocks\nfor sponsoring this video. Go to Storyblocks.com/JohnnyHarris to get started today with Storyblocks. So you can make more videos. Okay, let's go back the story. There's this one moment captured on film that I can't seem to get out of my mind. There's a boat sailing the waters to the remote island of Iceland in 1938. There are smiling faces and tourists doing what\nthey've always done and will continue to do, exploring the vastness of this country. And then there's shots of\nchildren smiling, playing, living. It's honestly beautiful footage. But when you pause this clip and think about who is the\nperson holding this camera, the person zoomed into all\nof these kids smiling faces, these people alive and well, the person holding this\ncamera is Hitler's girlfriend. Her name was Eva Braun. She was the longtime confidant, girlfriend and eventual wife of Adolf Hitler. The only person who could\ncall him by his name, and the one who bit into a\ncyanide pill alongside him as they both ended their lives together in a small study in Berlin, as Germany was losing the war. Oh, and this footage was taken just a few months before\nHitler invaded Poland to start the bloodiest war of all time. So who was she? And why was she on a tour in Iceland? And I guess most importantly, what role did Iceland play in Hitler's grand plans\nto take over the world? (upbeat orchestral music) Eva Braun met Hitler\nwhile working in Munich as a model and assistant\nto Hitler's photographer. They got together when\nshe was 19 and he was 42, and she remained the\nclosest person to Hitler leading up to and during the war. Eva was a photographer and is responsible for many of the images and\nfilm we have of Hitler today. Hitler wanted to keep\ntheir relationship a secret because he thought being a bachelor would like give him a wider\nappeal among Germany's women. Okay, big PR guy Hitler was. He would always say he\nwas married to Germany. Okay, so it's summer 1939, Hitler is literally two months\naway from invading Poland and starting world war II. And Eva is on a Nazi boat with this sweet swimming pool on it. I want a boat with a swimming pool. And they're traveling to Iceland. They visit the Geyser\nand see all the hot water and the steam and the volcanic rocks, and they're in Reykjavik. I mean, this doesn't\nlook too much different from my trip in Iceland. Anyway, it turns out\nthat the Nazi leadership was kind of obsessed with Iceland. And not because of the black\nsand beaches and glaciers, but because of the people. (curious music) Specifically, this guy, Henrich Himmler, the big dog in the Nazi regime, the literal architect of the Holocaust. He was the one who loved Iceland the most. He loved the Viking lore and legends, but he also had this twisted enthusiasm for the fact that the\nwhole country was white. Icelanders in Himmler's mind, were the pure superior Nordic race that he thought the Nazi\nmessage would resonate with. It's insane. So as the Nazis were\ngaining power in Germany, they turned to Iceland. They bought an apartment\nin the capital, Reykjavik, and they sent this guy a Nazi loyalist who was tasked with being\na diplomat to Iceland. His job was very simple, to commune with the racially\npure Icelandic people and fulfill Himmler's dream of\nconverting them to Nazi-ism. More on how that went\nlater, but real quick, another reason that the\nNazis were so into Iceland was because of this. These are the convoy routes between the UK and the Northern hemisphere. This is where goods supplies, ammo, troops would be moved between the two regions. See how these routes\nrun right past Iceland? - [Narrator] 1500 Air miles from Halifax, 825 miles from Scotland, and only 900 from Nazi-held Norway. - The Nazis realized that if\nthey could take over Iceland and have a base here, it would render this\nroute way too dangerous. So yeah, the Nazis were\nkind of into Iceland, not just because of the\nracial makeup of the people and the abundant resources, but also because of the\nprime strategic location in the impending war. Okay, so let's fast forward to a year after Eva\nBraun's trip to Iceland. It's 1940, the war has started, the Nazis have started\nconquering their neighbors, moving into Denmark,\nNorway, and soon Sweden. Meanwhile, Iceland is\nremaining a neutral country, a reminder that remaining\nneutral during world war II, isn't easy, but anyway,\nIceland is remaining neutral. And the diplomat who the\nNazis had sent to Iceland is still there, he's still working on\nrecruiting the Icelanders to the Nazi cause, and not having tons of success. He recruited like a small\ngroup of college kids to the cause. And overall he's kind of\ndisappointed in Iceland. The place is not what\nHimmler thought it was, but he doesn't tell anyone back home. He doesn't want to\ndisappoint the Nazi regime. Instead he confides in his journal, complaining that Iceland's theaters perform plays written by Jews and that they have no\napples in their stores. Like that's her complaint? It's like, oh, they have no apples in the stores. Like I hate this country. He also complained that\nthey held their forks with their right hands like shovels. Oh gosh. This was not the aryan in\nutopia that he was hoping for. But still Iceland had strategic value, the Nazi army is moving north. And you know, who's most\nfreaked out by this, by this movement north? This guy, Winston Churchill, leader of the UK at the time. Churchill said, quote, \"Whoever possesses Iceland\nholds a pistol firmly pointed \"at England and America and Canada.\" Yeah. That's pretty much sums it up. Churchill had been trying\nto convince Iceland to join their side, but Iceland was like, no, we have a hundred thousand\npeople. We have no army. We're going to remain neutral. And Churchill becomes impatient. So in may of 1940, not even a year after Eva\nBraun's getaway to Iceland, Churchill sends in his Navy, they showed up to Iceland on a mission called operation fork. Sort of weird name, but whatever. So the Navy arrives to\nthe port of Reykjavik, not to an army, but to a bunch of locals, like why is there a giant\nNavy arriving to our country? Remember Iceland doesn't have an army. So they sent the local police\nto tell the British Navy that they were in violation\nof Iceland's sovereignty. The British troops were\nlike, yeah, I know anyway, could you tell all these people to move so we can dock our boats\nand let our Marines off? And the Icelandic police\nwere like, yeah, okay, sure. No conflict, no confrontation. The British are politely invading Iceland. The most cordial invasion ever. They did this because\nthey were freaked out that the Nazis would do it first. The first thing they do when they show up is go to the German diplomat's house. They show up in certain\nknocking on the door and they're like, Hey, German diplomat, we just invaded Iceland\nso that the Nazis can't, by the way, you're arrested. And the diplomat from the\nother side of the room literally said, this is a quote, he said, \"you can't do that, \"Iceland is a neutral nation in the war.\" And the British troops said,\nand again, this is a quote, \"Oh yeah, neutral, like\nDenmark was neutral? \"Like Norway was neutral? \"These were neutral countries too. \"That didn't stop you guys from invading.\" So the diplomat is sitting there trying to get his furnace to work so he can burn all these documents before the British\nbreak in and arrest him, which they eventually did. When they broke in, they found a shrine to\nHitler in his house. He had burned a lot of documents, but he didn't burn his diary, which is why we know this guy really actually didn't like Iceland. So yeah. Now the British\nhave troops in Iceland, but as the war rages on Britain realizes that they needed troops elsewhere. They can't afford to have all these troops just sitting in Iceland as placeholders. So they call upon their\nfriends, the Americans, they're like America, can you please help us out with troops? And America is like,\nno, we already told you, we're not getting involved in the war. Because at this time America\nwas not involved in the war. They were neutral. So Britain is like, okay,\nis there a loophole here? So Britain asks Iceland to\nask America to come help them, as one neutral nation to another. America is like, okay cool, I can do that. - [Narrator] Another union,\nif not actually have allies, then suddenly have two armies\nwith the same objective was cemented when American\ntroops joined ours in Iceland. - [Narrator 2] With Iceland in his hands, Hitler could have\ncontrolled our sea lanes, but accepting an invitation\nand the Icelandic government we got there first. - So before the U.S. ever got officially involved in the war, which happened when Japan\nbombed Pearl Harbor, before all of that, they sent 25,000 troops to Iceland to hold down the fort so that the British troops\ncould go fight elsewhere. - [Narrator 2] At first,\nthe Icelanders didn't take to the strange faces and uniforms, which began to appear on the street. - I freaking love 1940s\nAmerican military documentaries. They're just so, they're just so bizarre. - [Narrator 2] Some were steaming\nhot and come in very handy when they want their long\nhandled johns fresh and dainty for that Saturday inspection. - While in Iceland, the Americans start building roads and bunkers and ports and bases. - [Narrator 2] The United States army is laying better road beds and is widening and strengthening the bridges to permit the passage of\nheavier trucks and tanks. - This is stuff that is still there today. A lot of Icelanders\nsee this as a blessing, since it helped upgrade\ntheir infrastructure. Helped give them like big, beautiful roads around the country, but rightfully so, many feel like they were used as a pawn by these super powers that\nviolated their sovereignty in the name of geo strategy, which is absolutely what happened. As always with occupation\nit's complicated. Anyway, but you know what, I'm super curious what Icelanders actually think about this history. Was the invasion of Britain and the subsequent presidents\nof the United States a blessing to Iceland? Or was this a deep violation\nof their sovereignty or both? I'm super curious and\nwill gladly read comments from any Icelander who\nhas thoughts on this. (curious music) So the Americans eventually got\ntotally involved in the war, as we know, and they\nhelped turn the Nazi tide, and eventually the allies\ndefeated the Nazis in Europe. Hitler and Eva Braun knew\nit was coming to an end. They didn't want to face the justice that was going to be dealt them for the atrocities by Hitler's regime. So they took their own\nlives in Berlin in 1945, as it was all coming to an end. And that's for Iceland, the troops eventually left and Icelanders were sort of done being a\npart of this global system that could just throw\nthem around like a pawn. They had been a part of the\nkingdom of Denmark in some way, but right after the war, they voted 97% to move\naway from the Danish crown and become totally independent,\nan independent Republic, which is what they are today. And they remain quite neutral\nand independent with no army, no membership in the EU, and despite the great powers\nwho tried to persuade them and occupy them, Iceland has retained its\nunique and independent culture. A couple of years ago, I got to interview the\nprime minister of Iceland when I was making an episode\nof Explained for Vox. I learned about how\nIceland leads the world in gender equality, in\nhappiness, in energy sustainable. (upbeat music) It's a special place and not because it is\nstrategically located. I will certainly be back\nmany times over the years. Thanks for watching."

    "captions": "- [Man] T-minus 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three. - There's a border that all of us share. And it keeps getting closer and closer. It's right above our heads. But it's not a border\nbetween two countries, it's actually a boundary to a place that used to be accessible\nto just a few of us, but now more and more of\nus can cross this boundary. - [Reporter] What's been dubbed\nthe billionaire space race. - And as that happens, we humans risk messing it up. We risk sealing this border completely so no person or object can escape earth. I want to show you how this might happen and what we can do to avoid it. - [Woman] Long-term simulations show an exponential growth in the number of objects in space. - This is low earth orbit. It's a zone about a thousand\nkilometers above earth. This is a place where earth's gravity can kind of pull you down, but just enough to put you\ninto a perpetual free fall that we call an orbit. Satellites we send into space can orbit earth as far out as tens of thousands of kilometers, but it is in this low earth orbit where a majority of\nearth's satellites reside. The satellites here give\nus images like these from telescopes like this. They also allow us to\nanticipate hurricanes, and observe trends like these. These satellites gave\nus the satellite phone. - Who has the satellite phone? - They connect people to the internet, and they help us map the world, which is something I am very grateful for. The satellites in low earth\norbit are incredibly important. Okay so how many satellites are up there? Like 50 or maybe 100? Let's see, how many, I'm Googling\non my phone, let's check. 6,000? 6,000? Whoa, okay. So there's 6,000 satellites\nfloating around the earth. Turns out that half of those are dead. They used to be satellites, now they're just hunks of metal the size of a small school bus\nspinning around our planet. Of the 3,000 or so working satellites, some are military, some are government, but more than half of them are commercial. Sorry, did that land? Let me just say it again. Half of the satellites are commercial, they're from private companies. Let me explain why that's a big deal. For most of the time that\nwe've been traveling to space, space has been a government thing. It was Russia that put\nup the first satellite into low earth orbit in the '50s. It was the Cold War so the U.S.\nwas like we can do that too, and we're gonna do it better, so they created NASA, and focused on getting as many\nsatellites as they could up into space. - We need science, this is for the American people, the most critical problem of all. - A bunch of these launches\njust sort of blew up because they were really terribly made, but eventually they got\nsatellites into space. They had something to prove. Space was a political thing at the time. - President Eisenhower\nreassures the nation that Russia's success\nwith the first satellite does not indicate a serious lag\nin American rocket research. - And the U.S. poured tons of\nmoney into making this happen, and they did. - Our satellite is definitely on orbit. - So at this point space\nwas a government thing, but boy has that changed. (upbeat music) In recent years there\nhas been an explosion of satellites being put into space that are not from the\ngovernment or military, but from private businesses, to the point where today in 2021 there are over 100 private companies that are building vehicles to\ntake more stuff into space. This is a space economy, it's a big deal. And because of that, more and more stuff is going into space. This year, 2021, we've already launched 1100 objects into space. That's the same total as\nwe did in all of 2020, and nearly 10% of what we've\never sent up into space. The numbers are going up\nfaster and faster and faster every single year. But there's a problem,\npotentially a huge problem with all of this stuff\ngoing up into space, and that problem is that space,\nat least low earth orbit, this area right around\nour earth is limited. Let me explain what I mean here. You have all of these objects\nfloating around our earth. More and more every year. So what happens if two of these satellites by chance collide? So what? Satellites collide and maybe some rich company loses\nsome money, who cares? No, no no no no no, no no no no. Reminder that these objects\nare flying around earth at 28,000 kilometers an hour, that's eight kilometers a second. That's one second, eight kilometers. They go around earth 12 times per day. And at that speed, things\nget a little bit crazy. A few years ago, a fleck of debris, like a little piece of dust that was one millimeter in diameter, like the tip of a sharp\npencil, a tiny fleck, was floating through low\nearth orbit at this speed, and it hit a satellite's solar panels. And this tiny fleck of dust left a giant gash in the panels. It was one millimeter in diameter. In 2009, a collision between\na defunct Russian space craft and an operational commercial satellite created this exact kind of shrapnel cloud, completely disintegrated. More than 2,300 hunks of space junk that are now floating around our planet at 28,000 kilometers an hour. This shrapnel at one point put\nthe Hubble Telescope at risk, and it sort of freaked people out. In an instant, two objects\nturned into thousands of objects, all with new paths\nfloating around our earth. So the fear here is that what if this became a chain reaction? One collision makes more debris which leads to another collision which means even more\ndebris, and more collisions, and suddenly low earth orbit becomes a minefield of space junk hurling around our\nplanet at deathly speeds and launches a domino effect that would wipe out our\nspace infrastructure leaving us trapped on the surface of earth for generations beneath a violent cloud of speeding shrapnel. Unable to send anything up to\nspace for a very long time. This is the nightmare scenario. It's a scenario that's\nportrayed in the movie Gravity which is a very good movie. Quick pause to thank today's\nsponsor, Policy Genius. Policy Genius is a place\nwhere you can compare quotes for life insurance. Life insurance is one of those things that you sort of don't\nthink about very often, you don't want to think about it because it's sort of\nassociated with big what-ifs. But it's one of these\nthings that is wise to have. And especially while you're young, you can lock in a really\nlow rate on life insurance, I actually just went\nthrough this whole process. I signed up using Policy Genius, and was able to compare quotes from a bunch of different life insurers. I did this all very quickly and then got on the phone with\nan expert at Policy Genius and soon I had a life insurance policy. So now I am insured,\nI have life insurance, and it feels actually really good. You can save 50% or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policy Genius. And you can get covered\nin as little as a week. For me it was super quick, I didn't have to go do a\nhealth exam or anything, I was just able to do all the\nhealth stuff over the phone, and I got covered. It was like 15 or 20 minutes of my time. Policy Genius never\nsells your information, or anything like that\nwhich I am a big fan of. They're just simple, and save you money. So head to PolicyGenius.com/JohnnyHarris, going to that link, which\nis also in my description, helps support this channel, but it also gets you started today on saving money with life insurance. All right, let's get\nback to space borders. Eventually of course, over the years, this debris would slowly\nfall into the atmosphere, it would lose altitude, and it would burn up in our atmosphere. But that would be generations\nof a world without satellites. A world that is sealed from space. Okay okay listen listen, this is not gonna happen anytime soon, by all counts we are safe\nfrom the chain reaction, the probabilities are very low. It isn't likely right now. There's a lot of space up there. - [Man] Space, the final frontier. - But we are sending up thousands of satellites per year now. This may not be an issue now, it certainly will be soon. So what do you do with this? We're in the midst of this new space race, just like the one between the Soviets and the U.S. in the '50s but this time it's not governments, it's like this guy, and a bunch of guys just like him. And they're the ones\nwho are racing to space, and they don't really care about the potential scenario\nof a chain reaction. Do you know why? Because they have investors to please, and a world to show that they can privatize space the fastest. (laughing) So let's talk about the U.S.\ngovernment really quick. Of the 3,000 working satellites, about 2,000 of them are American. They come from American companies or the American government. So you would expect the American\nspace government agency, NASA, to be the responsible steward of low earth orbit, and make sure that these\nprivate space companies are at least following some traffic rules when they send them up into space so that they don't collide. Alas, no one, including NASA, wants to be the one to slow\ndown the new space race. Instead they are focusing on quote, accelerating a thriving commercial economy in low earth orbit. The U.S. government is sort of doing what it did in the '50s, we've got a get an edge\non this new space thing and let's focus on just getting as much stuff up as we can. So NASA is helping to fund\nthese private space companies who are sending up so many satellites and objects into space. Like SpaceX, Elon Musk's company is sending up 60 satellites a month. 60 satellites just being\nthrust into space every month, and he's asked for a lot more. He wants to get 42,000 up there. That's what he's asking for, that's what he's asking for approval for, 42,000, just 42,000. So far he's gotten approval for 12,000. Amazon is now getting into the space game. They've been approved\nto send up over 3,000. We're not slowing down. So clearly the race is on, and no one's thinking\ntoo hard about traffic. - You're blaming me for the traffic? - Should I? - So how do we avoid\nfilling up low earth orbit? And avoid the collisions that could potentially cause a devastating chain reaction. These companies are taking some protocol, like SpaceX will send up these satellites in like a caravan, like a line of satellites which looks really trippy by the way. I was out stargazing for\nmy galaxy video last year and I looked up and I saw\nthis like perfect line of blinking dots in the sky and I was like what is happening? I was sure that I was seeing a UFO, like this is it. Like I've had my encounter\nwith extra terrestrials. It was like an existential moment for me, I was like what is happening? 20 minutes later I looked it up and learned about the\ncaravans that SpaceX does. They do this so that all of the satellites are in the same path so that they have way less\nlikelihood of colliding because they're not just on random paths they're like all together. So yeah these private companies are taking some precautions, but as we all know, you can't rely on private companies to regulate themselves\nfor the good of everyone. Like, are we really gonna be like you guys regulate yourself and we'll all be safe and\neveryone will be good, no. That's not how it works. What we need is mutually agreed upon laws on how stuff can be launched\ninto low earth orbit so that we actually have some\ntraffic management in space. There are no rules of the road in space, no formal agreements on\nhow traffic should behave in low earth orbit. In other words, this is the wild west. Wait, isn't there like space law? Like treaties? Like the outer space\ntreaty, the moon treaty, the International Space Station, yeah but none of these\nthings talk about traffic. All these countries have\nsigned these treaties that just say space is for everybody, no one can conquer space, no Star Wars. - That isn't very reassuring. - Closest any treaty gets to addressing the space traffic thing, says that quote, states shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects. In other words, if you send an object up, and your country damages an\nobject from another country, your country has to take\nresponsibility in some form. But wait, does that actually happen? Remember that defunct Russian space craft that collided with the\ncommercial satellite in 2009? Who took responsibility? And wait, was it the Russian satellite that hit the commercial one, or was it the commercial one\nthat hit the Russian one? Like how do you dole out responsibility and blame when you're talking about two satellites just floating through space who happen to run into each other. So in the end, the responsibility landed squarely on the\nshoulders of, nobody. - How did we get into this mess? - Decision makers couldn't even agree on who was responsible for launching the commercial\nsatellite in the first place because multiple countries were\ninvolved with launching it, and they hadn't registered it with the UN like they promised they would\nback in some treaty in 1972. I mean it's a total mess. There is no order or regulation\nor clarity in space law, which right now is fine,\nbut soon it won't be. So here we are with no traffic rules, no history of holding anyone accountable for unintentional space collisions, and we're about to send up tens of thousands more satellites. What we need is productive cooperation, like humans have been able to do in so many aspects of our\nglobal international system. The International Space\nStation is a great example. It has functioned as a multi-national\ncollaborative project in space. Unfortunately what I've learned is that when there's\ncompetition among countries, a lot of these cooperative efforts sort of go out the window. There is growing tension\nbetween two super powers, China and the U.S. And China is in the middle of constructing their own space station\nfor low earth orbit. India is preparing to\nsend their own as well. This is competition, not cooperation. Our existing space law, which was all sort of drafted\nin the '60s and the '70s never anticipated private companies sending up thousands of satellites. And it didn't anticipate\nChina and India and the U.S. Competing for space power. Our desire to explore space is not just about showing how powerful and innovative we are. So much technology has come\nfrom our space exploration. From solar cells to cochlear implants, to firefighting technology. The development of the micro chip which was majorly accelerated by NASA, and now microchips drive our entire world. The pursuit of reaching out into space has consistently driven\nmeaningful innovation. So this is important, we should absolutely protect the future of this really wonderful\nthing that humans have done. We've escaped our atmosphere, we've escaped gravity, and we've learned so much in the process. So, there are a lot of objects in space, they're floating around, and there is a body of treaties and law that is way outdated. My hope is that as we send\nthese thousands and thousands of satellites into space, we consider the\nimplications of what happens if we get too hasty,\nsend too much stuff up and things start to run into each other. It's not worth the risk in my mind. If we don't look ahead, we could turn space from a border that we can all cross together, and learn together as human beings, into a border that is impenetrable, that's dangerous, that keeps us trapped here on this warming planet, unable to continue to explore\nthe world of outer space.

    "title": "The FISH & CHIPS Wars: U.K. vs Iceland",
    "video_id": "4Lv0xEFtUc0",
    "captions": "(upbeat music) (mumbling loudly) - Iceland is so cool. It's like, I'm looking for\nsomewhere to eat for dinner and every other results on\nGoogle maps is fish and chips. - [Narrator] A mobile Fish and Chips. (upbeat music) - Just do two orders of fish and chips.\n- Yeah. - So I'm in Iceland and I just found out that the\nUK went to war with Iceland several times between the 50s and the 70s, over one thing, fish and chips. I'm not kidding, there were three conflicts\nbetween the 50s and the 70s over fish that they\nuse for fish and chips. - [Narrator] Let's have\nsome fish and chips. (upbeat music) - Fish, and chips, this is real. I wanna tell you the story buckle up. Yeah, what kind of fish is it? - It's Cod. - [Narrator] Would you\nlike some fish and chips? - [Narrator] Iceland, it is above all the home of the vital fishing industry. NATO's banner flies proud. - [Narrator] The Iceland is\nunilaterally extended at fishing up to 12 miles. - Yes, I know I have done fish wars. (dramatic music) In multiple different permutations, from India, Sri Lanka, Prawn Wars to US, Canada, Fish Wars. Well, here's another installment of how fish make it really\nhard to draw borders because they live in the ocean and so countries fight over them. (soft music) (water splashing) (wind blowing) (mumbling loudly) To understand why the UK\nwould go to war with Iceland, you have to understand fish and chips. Fish and chips are a giant deal in the UK, it's like, I need to get those stats up. A quarter of Britons, eat\nfish and chips once per week. - First thing I think we\nought to take a look at is an English pub. - Pubs all around the\ncountry serve millions, tens of millions, hundreds\nof millions of meals, of fish and chips, every year. It is an institution, it is a\npart of the cultural fabric. (soft music) However, Britain doesn't have enough fish to upkeep this demand for fish and chips, so where do they turn to? - [Narrator] Iceland. - So the fish that they\nuse for fish and chips is called Cod. (soft music) Cod is a delicious buttery creamy fish. But do you know who else loves Cod? Iceland, in fact, you might argue that Iceland loves Cod more\nthan any other country on earth. If you need proof of how\nmuch Iceland loves Cod, you just got to go into\none of these grocery stores and you will see it right on the shelves. (dramatic music) - Okay, who wants to try some dried aged Cod?\n- Not me! - So yeah, Iceland loves Cod. In fact, they used to have Cod (chuckles) on their coat of arms, like it is a part of\ntheir national identity. And to understand why\nthey love Cod so much, you just need to look at the\noceans around this island. (upbeat music) (birds chirping) These waters surrounding Iceland\nhere in the North Atlantic are some of the most\nwell-stocked waters on earth with fish, especially Cod. This country has relied for centuries and continues to rely deeply on fish. I've been driving all around this country, deep into the west fjords\nand all around every region of this country. Everywhere I go, I see fish and fishermen and fishing infrastructure, the lifeblood of this\ncountry of Iceland is fish. (soft music) So you can see where this is going, the British loved their fish and chips, which comes from Cod. Iceland loves their fish\ngenerally, especially their Cod and for centuries, this\nhasn't been a problem. Iceland has been able to\nfish their abundant waters and Britain was also able\nto come into these waters and fish them for themselves but after World War II,\nthat started to change. (soft music) (birds chirping) (bell ringing) (acknowledging loudly) Hello, hi there. Like, crack them open, put 'em on a pan? - Yep, you can do that too. (engine roaring) - You guys, I bought eggs from a bird I don't really\nknow what it, is that one okay? - Why did you? Those really (exclaims), no. - We are eating these eggs. - I don't wanna eat.\n- We're gonna eat them? - We're going to eat these eggs. - Oh no! (eggs sizzling) - Man, it feels so good\nto be on the road again, after a year and a half home, so good. - [Narrator] The Cold War\n(mumbles) by the (mumbles), for all Europe, comes at last to Germany. - You have to understand\nthat after World War II, the entire world changed. Suddenly you have these super powers, especially the United States, calling the shots on what\na new economic world order was gonna look like and that\ncame with a lot of trade. Suddenly, if you had an\nabundance of some resource, you could ship it somewhere else and make money for your country. So Iceland started to\nparticipate more and more in the Global Fish trade. They had so much fish in their waters outside of their country and they were like, we should\njust start like shipping this abundance to other people and making money for our country. (upbeat music) But when they started to\ngo out into their waters to fish more and more, what they saw was a bunch\nof British fishermen out in their waters who had\nbeen fishing there for years. - [Narrator] Well, hello there, chaps. - And the British were like, \"Well, you don't technically\nhave any claim over this water, \"it's technically international waters, \"you've never claimed\nit, so we can fish here.\" And Iceland was like, \"You're\nright, let's change that.\" Iceland's territorial waters where they exclusively could fish only extended four nautical\nmiles off their coast, not very much. The British were like, \"Cool,\nlike we don't need to go \"into your little four mile zone.\" So Iceland, this tiny country was like, \"We're gonna extend it to 12 miles.\" The British were now technically fishing inside of Icelandic waters. But Britain, one of the most\npowerful countries in the world was like, \"Cool, there's\nthis island nation \"of 170,000 people with no military \"and they've just declared \"that their boundary goes 12\nmiles into the ocean, cool.\" And they totally ignored it. - Try and stop me. (dramatic music) - So it's the 1950s, Britain\nis fishing, fishing, fishing, their fishing ships Cod\noff the coast of Iceland and Iceland has no Navy, they have no way of really enforcing this\nbesides their coast guard. So they send their coast guard\nout to detain the fishermen, the British fishermen and this\nworks for like two seconds until the British sends\nin their like legit Navy to scare off the coast guard and thus begins the Cod Wars. (whooshing loudly) I wanna say thank you to today's sponsor, which is Skillshare. I've used Skillshare for many, many years, long before they came to\nsponsor a YouTube video.

(soft music) (mumbling loudly) So it's now, like the 1950s\nand the Icelandic coast guard is holding their ground. They're showing up to the ocean whenever they see British ships and they are confronting the Royal Navy. They are not backing down, even though they are a tiny\ncountry with no firepower and no leverage, they are not backing down\nbecause they freaking love Cod. - It's delicious. - I'm like, dude, Iceland\npunching above your weight here, this is amazing and guess what? It works! The world Navy backs down and\nBritain finally recognizes this 12 nautical mile boundary that Iceland unilaterally\ndeclared for themselves. The first Cod War is over. (bell ringing) (soft music) And now, we are entering\nthe west view wards. Hold on, look at the map. We're in this RV and I'm not really sure it's\ngonna handle these gravel roads but we will quickly find out if it does handle these gravel roads. I'm just excited to see Iceland\nat some of its most rugged, here we go. So now we are in Cod Peace. Cod Peace lasts for about 10 years, but Britain is getting\ntired of their expensive Cod for their fish and chips. They want more Cod and Iceland\nis the place to get it, so they come back. So British ships are now showing\nup into the Iceland zone, leaving the waters depleted. Iceland will not have this. They freaking love their Cod, they're not gonna let Britain steal it, So they decide to up the ante and they declare a 50\nnautical mile boundary. They're like, all of\nthis water is now ours, back off Britain. This really pissed off\nBritain and not just Britain, but also west Germany and Denmark because now Iceland's water expansion was now getting into the\nwaters of these other countries who had fisheries in this area. But Iceland didn't care, they're like, \"Listen, we love Cod, \"this is like the best fishing\nin all of the Atlantic, \"we are not backing down, \"even though we have no army \"and we only have 170,000 people.\" - I'm not fucking leaning! - Cue Cod Wars, Number two. - Let's get ready to rumble! (bell ringing) (cheering loudly) - [Narrator] In 1972, again, without international legal backing and increased it to 50 miles. - The UK took this one to court first and International Arbitration\nruled in favor of the UK. They're like, \"Dude, Iceland, \"you can't just extend your waters \"50 nautical miles into the\nocean, you can't do that.\" And guess what Iceland said? - Yeah, well, just watch me. (laughing loudly) - And they just totally ignored it. (soft music) - So even though the most\npowerful countries in the world, plus some of their friends\nand an international court ruled against Iceland, Iceland dug in their heels and was like. - I'm not fucking leaving! - Britain is getting tired\nof this, they're like, \"Come on guys, we need\nto fish these waters. \"we need our fish and chips, \"like you have no standing\nhere, we're done.\" So they send in their Navy once again. \u266a Mama mia, here I go again \u266a The British Navy decides to\nescalate things a little bit and start ramming the\nIcelandic coast guard boats. - [Narrator] Continued the skirmish which ended in yet another (mumbles). (horn blaring) (upbeat music) - No more warning shots, no\nmore soft core standoffs, we are now ramming each other. This leads to a series of\nstandoffs in the North Atlantic, between Icelandic coast\nguard and the Royal Navy, the most powerful Navy on earth. (exclaiming loudly) These fish and chips people, they love their fish and chips. - It's really good. (laughing loudly) It's delicious. - So, does Iceland back down\nin the second Cod War and say, \"Okay, fine, the International\nCourt ruled against us, \"Britain and West Germany\nand Denmark don't like this, \"we're just gonna chill out.\" No, they didn't, they\nkept it up and in fact, they decided to pull out their\none major piece of leverage in all of this, which was\ntheir alliance with NATO. - [Narrator] NATO land is\ncomposed of 14 different nations with a combined army, 7 million strong. - Easily, my favorite part about Iceland is that you can be driving through some random mountain paths,\nlike we've been doing, at midnight and you can\nwander upon waterfall after waterfall, after\nwaterfall that are just there. They're just there. Just look at this waterfall\nthat I'm looking at. It is insane. Iceland was a member of NATO. - [Narrator] NATO was\nfounded April four, 1949 by 12 nations of widely\ndifferent languages and customs. During its six years, NATO has well proved it's power for peace. - And they occupied a\nfairly important role because of where they exist, they exist right here\nin the North Atlantic, a very strategic place. So Iceland decides to\npull out their wild card, the thing that they've been\nholding onto this whole time, which is we will withdraw from NATO if you do not recognize our\n50 nautical mile boundary of the ocean. If Iceland withdraws from NATO, because of something the British did, the US is gonna be pissed at Britain. - No, let go of him (yells). - Tell that bitch to be cool. - I'm gonna kill you.\n- Say, bitch, be cool. - Be cool, honey bunny.\n- Say, bitch, be cool. - Be cool.\n- Tell that fucking bitch to chill! - Be cool, honey bunny.\n- Chill that fucking bitch out! - So Britain was like, \"Okay fine, you win 50 miles, you got it.\" - Gosh, darn it, I give up. It's yours, you can have it. - Cod Wars, Episode Two is over. (ringing softly) Iceland wins again (laughs). So this is now the\nsecond time that Iceland, this tiny country with no\nmilitary has like bested one of the most powerful\ncountries on earth, all because of fish. They freaking love fish here, like don't mess with Iceland's fish. But this isn't over. It's the 1970s and we are about to commence\nCod War, Episode Three, Return of the Cod. (soft music) (mumbling softly) Officially made it to the\nWestern most point of Europe. I think that's right, I mean, we tried to say we were in the Western most point of view like two years ago, in this moment. - [Narrator] Just a 30 minute drive outside of downtown Sintra is the Western most point\nof continental Europe. - And yeah, that obviously wasn't, I mean, it was like continental Europe. So now we, here we are again, in the Western most point\nof Europe right here. I don't know where we are, but\nwe're really freaking west. We've been driving for like\nfour hours on dirt roads to get to this cliff on\nthis very tip of Iceland on the west fjords. You know, we're here to see puffins. What are we here to see son? - Puffins?\n- Yes. (soft music) - Dad, wait for me. - I'm waiting for you, big team. Man, these puffins are just right here. They were just right under\nour nose the whole time, look at this. I mean, I guess I'd seen puffins like on Instagram or\nsomething, but I had no idea just how striking these birds are. This is, photographing these birds today has been just it's really\nhelped me appreciate them. (waves crashing) Episode Three is basically a repeat of the last two episodes. The British move into these\nwaters to get their little fish because they want fish and chips. More ramming, tons more\nramming, more standoffs. Britain is not okay with this tiny country pushing them around. I mean, it's Britain, they're\nused to just literally taking over any country\nthey want in the whole world and they're being told what to do by this little tiny island\nnation, they're not liking it. What I love about Iceland is that they don't just dig in\ntheir heels and not concede, they would push a little bit further. So this time they're like, \"We don't just want 50 nautical miles, \"we want 200 nautical miles off our coast \"for exclusive fishing.\" Britain is like, \"No, this is not good, \"how are we getting bested\nevery time we try to fish?\" This got so bad that the UK and Iceland actually broke off diplomatic relations. They were like really angry at each other until the Americans come\nin and they're like, \"Dude, stop it.\" NATO, the cold war, nuclear weapons, like stop crying over your fish and chips, we have bigger priorities. - Chill out Dick word. - And so they backed down and they recognize the\n200 nautical mile claim that Iceland was asserting. It turns out a couple of\nyears later, the UN developed the United Nations\nConvention On Law of the Sea, a big document that actually codifies that every country gets 200 nautical miles of exclusive economic activity. But Iceland was already\nthinking in these terms, they're like the exclusive\neconomic zone hipsters, like they were far (chuckles)\nahead of everyone else. (soft music) There are always sheep on\nthe side of the road here, including loads of baby\nsheep that are so precious, it always seems like\nthey're about to dart out in front of the side of the road, giving us loads of anxiety,\nbut they're very cute. She has never seen rain deer before, so she's taking in the reindeer. (exclaiming softly) Pretty special? - Unbelievable. - So, what are the Cod Wars teach us? Well, as an international relations guy, I'm sorta like, this doesn't square up with a lot of the theories\nthat I learned in school. In school, we learned\nthat when countries trade with each other and with when\nthey're bound by alliances, they tend to cooperate better than ever. In this case, what you see is countries that are bound to each other through Alliance and through\ntrade who are not cooperating because they are bound to each other by trade and institutions. In fact, one of the major\nbargaining chips in the war was the fact that Iceland\nwas gonna withdraw from NATO. They use the institution as leverage. - [Narrator] We have declared\nthat the Icelandic law will be upheld and I have on\nthat law, nothing more cliche. - All I have to say, this\nis a super unique case of a tiny country using its leverage to basically make one of the most powerful\ncountries in the world concede and it totally worked. - This is me, all right,\nI'm not a fucking athlete, this is my fucking way,\nthis is how I work. - But the bigger lesson\nfor me is, and the thing I'm gonna take away, is\ndon't (beeps) with Iceland when it comes to fish. (ringing softly) Okay, see you later."

    "captions": "- There is a chance that\nCOVID-19 was created in a lab. And then it leaked out\nand infected the world. - [Lady News Reporter] Chinese city, where the coronavirus pandemic is believed to have started... - A very competent,\ntrustworthy scientists. - Probably it was incompetent.\nSomebody was stupid. - Whoa. Did I just say that? Yes, I did. Six months ago, I would not\nhave been able to say that but today I can and we\nneed to talk about it. Humans, including myself,\nhate uncertainty, ambiguity. We want to know what happened\nbut in the case of COVID-19, we still don't know exactly what happened. We don't know where it came from. And to try to get at the real answer, you have to navigate\nall sorts of politics, but wait, isn't this a science question? Isn't it a matter of epidemiology? The origin of a virus? It should be but woven into\nthis scientific question are a bunch of heavy political questions and considerations that are influencing what kind of questions\nwe're allowed to ask and what kind of answers\nwe're allowed to give. So, I wanna strip away the\npolitics, the tension with China, the idea that this all sounds\nlike one big conspiracy and I wanna just look at the\nevidence of one question, which is, where did COVID-19 come from? - [Narrator] The most trafficked\nwild animal in the world. - Wuhan also has China's only bio-safety level four super laboratory. - China has a history of lab accidents. (suspenseful music) Are you suggesting that\nmaybe you have some evidence that this was not a\nnaturally occurring virus? - So it's not just me who wants\nto know the answer to this. Last month president Biden asked the U.S intelligence community to double down in answering\nthis one question, where did COVID come from? - It's important to\nknow the answer to that. Right now, there are two major hypotheses, one is the spillover hypothesis and the second one is\nthe lab leak hypothesis, which has up until recently been seen as a fringe conspiracy theory. - Complete baloney. - And I'm gonna explain why\nthat changed in just a minute but first let's look at each of these. First, the spillover hypothesis. - Health officials believe\nCOVID-19 originated in animals, sold in a so-called wet market in China. - Pangolin kissed the turtle. (audience laughing) - The spillover hypothesis says that the coronavirus came from bats in China, which is pretty predictable. Bat's in China have tons of\ncorona viruses all the time. They're usually not infectious to humans but the hypothesis says\nthat a strain came about that was infectious to maybe an animal, maybe one of these guys, a pangolin. And then that animal showed\nup in some supply chain, some market in central China and it came in contact with the human and the human got COVID-19. And in fact, for a while, it\nwas this particular market in Wu Han that was seen as the culprit. They thought the bat\nvirus was in an animal somewhere in this market. And now listen for a really long time up until just recently, I didn't\nknow this was a hypothesis, I thought this was a fact. In the early days of the pandemic, they would talk about this\nlike it wasn't a question, they'd be like, and the virus that came from this meat market. - The virus originated from a market. - [Male Reporter] This meat market, Ground Zero for the outbreak. - But guess what? There's\nno direct evidence for this. They don't even have pangolin\nin the Wu Han wet market. And soon we learned that the\nfirst official COVID case had no contact with this market. So the Chinese CDC had\nto come out and say, okay, no, it actually has\nnothing to do with this market, we have no idea where\nthis outbreak came from but even after they said that the market wasn't the epicenter, the idea was still that\nthis came from a bat that transferred it to an animal, that transferred it to a human, the spillover hypothesis. The main reason why this\nhypothesis gained so much traction was because this is how\npandemics usually happen. Of the past five pandemics, four of them were the result of a virus jumping from an animal onto humans. So even though no one had\nfound an animal with COVID-19 to prove this theory, they sort of presumed that it had to be because look at these other four, but wait, what about this one? The Russian flu of 1977, was likely the result of a lab accident. And it ended up killing\nhundreds of thousands of people but even still the spillover\nhypothesis was kind of gospel. (suspenseful music) Hey, real quick, I'm gonna be doing a Q&A\non discord next week, a week from today on Thursday, it's gonna be a live stage event, which is sort of like a personal like chat with whoever wants to join. Discord, by the way is the\nsponsor of today's video. Thank you Discord. But anyway, this event\nis where you can join and ask me whatever questions you want. And I will be talking for\nan hour about storytelling and about my process and about the future of documentary things and bright trip and all of the things I will be answering all of your questions in this sort of personal back and forth Discord live stage setting. Anyone can join, it's\nfree all you have to do is sign up for Discord, which\nis like a 15 second process. Sign up for discord, there's\na link in my description where you can register for this Q&A event, which is next week, Thursday\nat noon Eastern time. Okay. So I'm going to put on\nthe screen what time it is in other time zones around the world, noon Eastern time on Thursday, I'll be answering tons\nof questions on Discord as a live stage event. And I'm kind of excited\nto hear from all of you, to hear what questions you\nhave and to chat and catch up and see what people are thinking about. So, thank you this Discord\nfor sponsoring this video, let's get back to it. But quietly, there was another theory that was brewing under the surface. One that many experts\ndidn't talk about publicly at the time, but they thought about. They were thinking of\nanother building in Wuhan, not this market, but another building that was just a few miles down the road, this one right here, the\nWuhan Institute Of Virology. - So here's, what's crazy. It's exactly in this lab in Wuhan, where scientists have been experimenting for years with corona viruses, engineering them to make\nthem even more infectious to human beings. - More infectious to humans? Wow! By the way, that's Podgy,\nhe's one of my producers. He reached out to me a while back and said that we should look\ninto the alternative hypothesis of where COVID came from, including this idea that it\nmay have leaked from this lab. At the time I was quite skeptical, I had heard rumblings about\nthe idea of the lab accident that caused COVID and I'd\nsort of written it off because it just seemed so conspiracy like just like low hanging for conspiracy, like super engineered\nvirus escapes from lab and starts global pandemic. It's like new world orders. It just reeks of internet\nconspiracy and disinformation. And in addition to that, the only people who were touting this were like people who are\nnot very good at the truth and people who also liked\nto pick fights with China. - I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that\nlaboratory in Wuhan. - But I told Podgy that\nif there's any evidence, even circumstantial that\nwarrants looking further into this hypothesis,\nI would be interested in checking it out. And it turns out there was\nsuch evidence and here it goes. (lively music) So, this is the lab leak hypothesis, and I'm gonna unpack it the best I can. First, let's talk about this lab. It's located in central\nChina in the city of Wuhan and for years, they\nhave been experimenting on corona viruses what\nPodgy was telling me about. The question is, why\non earth would you want to make a coronavirus\nmore infectious to humans? - So this is what's known\nas, gain of function research and the idea is to study\nmore infectious versions of the virus in order to\nlearn from that what we need in order to stop the next pandemic from ever happening in the first place. - Gain of function research. This is sort of like\ntesting nuclear weapons. You're sort of playing with fire, testing something that has the power to kill millions of\npeople but you're doing so in the name of like helping humanity. There are only three places on earth that do this sort of risky research and it's supposed to be done\nin these super high security bio secure facilities that\nhave all these parameters to make sure that the\nengineered virus doesn't escape. And by the way, in the\nscientific community, many people think this is\ntoo risky and not worth it. One critique I read from a\nscientific journal said that, \"If the virus escapes, nobody\ncould predict the trajectory.\" We're messing with\ngenetics and that's scary. Okay, but just to remember for a second, that all of this gain of function research is happening in like 2015 through 2018. Just rewind for a second. None of us had heard the\nword coronavirus before. This was effectively some\nboring, wonky, nerdy debate happening between super niche scientists who were studying the best\nway to look at viruses and all the while, as they did work, studying all of these\ncorona viruses from bats, the freezers in this lab\nin Wuhan started filling up with more and more samples of\ncorona viruses of all kinds. Some just captured from bats and caves and others engineered to be\nmore infectious to humans. But again, no one really cared. If I had made a video\nabout this work in 2017, you wouldn't have watched it. But in 2017, there was\nsomeone who did care, it was someone at the\nU.S embassy in Beijing. They caught wind that in this Wuhan lab, they were curating corona viruses and engineering more infectious ones. This wasn't some secret, this was like in\ncollaboration with scientists in the U.S and around the world. But even still, they sent\na team of health experts to check out the lab and\nwhat they saw troubled them. The lab wasn't nearly as\nsafe as it needed to be. And the managers at the lab said that they were lobbying for more resources so that they could hire\nproperly trained technicians to safely run the lab. The diplomats were concerned and they sent two messages\nback to Washington, DC at two different periods of time. They said this lab isn't safe and the state department\nshould work with the Chinese to tighten security. These two cables went\nback to Washington, DC and both were ignored. Again, this was like super\nboring stuff in 2017 and 2018, no one had heard of Anthony Fowchee, this wasn't top priority. So it was ignored, until 2020 when suddenly we all care about virology. - Concerns about the deadly coronavirus, officially getting the U.S. (suspenseful music) - Okay, so you have this lab that's doing gain of function research, there may be not very secure. Now it's 2020, and I\nneed to explain something that was hard for me\nto understand at first but it's very important. Any hypothesis as to the origins of COVID has to take into account the fact that this new deadly\ncoronavirus called COVID-19 broke out in the very city where the largest repository\nof coronavirus samples sit in a freezer in this lab, some of which have been engineered to become more infectious to humans. Oh, in the lab has been\ndeemed not super safe. If the outbreak had\nhappened in some other city where there was no lab with a freezer full of corona viruses, we would not be having this conversation, this would not even be on the table, but Wuhan is the epicenter of\ncoronavirus samples on earth because of this lab- - Oh my God! There's been an outbreak of chocolatey goodness,\nnear Hershey, Pennsylvania. What do you think happened? Like, oh, I don't know. Maybe a steam shovel\nmated with a cocoa bean or it's the (beep) chocolate factory. (audience laughs) - Okay, wait, wait, hold on I know some of you were thinking this, I was thinking this, at first, I thought this\nwas a logical fallacy. Originally, I had said, well, of course, it's not a coincidence that\nthere's a coronavirus lab in the same city, that\nthere was an outbreak. The lab was probably set up because there's a lot of corona viruses so they set up the lab to study it so that they could prevent it\nbut then I read an interview with one of the top researchers at the Wuhan lab, one of\nthe biggest experts in bats and corona viruses and\nthis changed my mind. (upbeat music) Her name is Shi Zhengli but her nickname is, 'The bat woman.' (crushing noises) - You're about to become compost. - Because she's made her\ncareer out of going into caves, getting coronavirus samples from bats, so that she can study them. She's like a top expert on this stuff and she works in the Wuhan lab. When she heard that there\nwas a coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, she was in\nShanghai at a conference, so she got on a train\nto rush back to Wuhan so she's on this train and\nlater she said in an interview, \"I wondered if the local\nhealth authorities got it wrong by calling it the coronavirus.\" She's like, something's off here. Wuhan is in central China and from the bat woman's\nextensive study into this she knows that it's\nactually Southern China, where all the bats are and\nwhere coronavirus is most likely to jump from animals to humans. We're down here in Southern China that's where COVID-19\ncousin SARS broke out in the early 2000, that's the place where there is an actual\nmajor risk of coronavirus jumping from animals. So the bat woman is on this\ntrain, shaking her head, she literally said in the interview, \"I had never expected this\nkind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China.\" This is a thing that\nhappens in Southern China, not Central China. And then the terrifying\nthought hit her, she said, \"Could they have come from our lab?\" Her first thought was the\nhealth officials got this wrong, it's either not coronavirus or if it is, it probably came from our lab, that's the more likely scenario, not that it jumped from animals\nlike it does southern China. So no, the lab isn't set up in Wuhan because Wuhan is the\nepicenter of corona viruses jumping from animals,\ninstead Wuhan's relationship to corona viruses isn't that it's common, that it breaks out in wet markets, no, it's because of the lab. The lab is the world's largest sample of corona viruses on earth. Now, let's be clear this isn't part proof that anything happened,\nthis is circumstantial but it is absolutely a firm\nfoundation for a hypothesis that potentially this\ncould have come from a lab bat woman herself, that\nwas her first thought. And as I've been reading the\naccounts from other virologists and epidemiologists around the world who heard of a virus coming out of Wuhan, they thought about the lab. They're like, oh, shit\nthere's a giant lab there with tons of viruses, I\nwonder if it came from there. Now, listen, this lady who\nwe're calling, bat woman, the bat expert, went to the\nlab as soon as she got to Wuhan she was sort of freaking out. She had been losing sleep. And she looked at all of\nthe data, all of the samples and determined that none\nof the samples engineered or natural were the same as COVID-19. None of them were an exact match and she sighed a breath of relief and she felt like,\nokay, it wasn't our lab. For most scientists, that was enough proof to put the lab leak hypothesis to rest. They're like, oh yeah,\nbat woman said that, none of the samples were\nidentical to COVID-19 but for many others,\ntrusting this one woman to tell us the truth or to have done a thorough investigation is not good enough evidence\nfor us to rule this out. The world who has suffered\ngreatly because of COVID-19, deserves a chance to truly investigate not trust one Chinese researcher. - The world has reached\nanother grim milestone in the history of the\ncoronavirus pandemic. - This is globally the\ndeath toll has now topped a staggering 3 million people. - But for some reason, China is not really playing\nball with letting an inquiry or an investigation happen. When Australia got up and called for a transparent investigation into COVID origins, including looking into\nthe lab leak hypothesis, China immediately retaliated\nwith economic sanctions on Australian products like wine and beef. What? A little defensive. Like wouldn't China want to have an independent investigation\ninto this hypothesis so that if it's false,\nit can be proven false and we can put it to rest. It seems like that would\nbe in their interest and yet they're making\nit incredibly difficult for anyone to do an investigation. Instead, we have to rely\non U.S spies and intel to like piece this together. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that there was intel that said that, three researchers at\nthe Wuhan lab got sick with COVID like symptoms and they had to be\nhospitalized in November 2019, weeks before the first\nofficial case of COVID. Again, this isn't proof but it's definitely reason\nto ask more questions. China, stop making us\nrely on intel from spies, put the hypothesis to bed\nand let us investigate but they won't, which is\nlike incredibly suspicious. - Mike at the end of the day, it's profoundly in China's\ninterest to do this as well because look, it's suffered too. - That's the lab leak\nhypothesis, unsafe lab, that's the coronavirus epicenter and an engineer's viruses to\nbe more infectious for humans has a little mishap, which\nturns into a global pandemic. It's a feasible hypothesis\nthat deserves investigation. Now, listen, if your brain\nis anything like my brain, what both of our brains\nare doing right now, is scheming to find\nsome sort of certainty, we're like, oh, look at\nall this evidence here. They were in the hospital and Wuhan is actually the epicenter and we're like piecing it all together. Our brains love to do this, to lay out the circumstances\nand fill in the blanks so that we can believe in\nsome sort of certain thing, our brains hate ambiguity but please don't be tricked\nby your hate for ambiguity. We have to remember that\nneither the spillover hypothesis nor the lab leak hypothesis\nhave solid direct evidence that proved them one way or the other. The main evidence for the\nspillover hypothesis right now is the idea that historically, this is how viruses like to start, they jump from animals onto humans. That's a really solid\nbasis for our hypothesis. We should absolutely\ncontinue to investigate that. But guess what? It's been a year and a half\nand we haven't found an animal who carries COVID after a year and a half? So as of now, it is still in\nthe category of hypothesis but if you read the news in 2020, it seemed like the case was\nclosed, it was a settled thing, yeah, the coronavirus\njumped from an animal. - The pangolin. - Pangolin. - Pangolins. - Probably one of these\npangolins in a market, everyone move on. Meanwhile, the lab leak\nhypothesis also had solid basis. None of the evidence I've\ntalked about today is new, it's all been around. And yet until recently\nthe idea of a lab accident being the origins of COVID-19, was deemed as far off fringe conspiracy. - This question about the Wuhan lab, we know that it's been debunked that this virus was manmade or modified. - A major reason for that was because there was\nthe Trump administration that was constantly\noverstating the hypothesis, claiming they had way more\nevidence than they actually did, labeling it, the China virus. - The Chinese virus. It's not racist at all, no, not\nat all, it comes from China. - Which helped fuel a\nspike in discrimination and violence against people\nof East Asian descent. And then Tom Cotton\ngets up and says, this- - The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market. So we don't know where it originated but we do know that we have\nto get to the bottom of that. We also know that just a few miles away from that food market is China's only bio-safety level four super laboratory that researches human infectious diseases. - Well, this is awkward. Yeah. It turns out what Tom Cotton said, actually is totally sensible. I had written this into the script, thinking that Tom Cotton said some crazy stuff about something. - What 5G actually does, it absorbs oxygen and that's really important know. - But it turns out that Tom Cotton back in like February of\n2020 was stating a hypothesis that a bunch of scientists\nnow think is totally legit. Nothing's changed, we\ndon't have any new evidence and yet at the time it was written off as a total fringe conspiracy. Here's the New York Times, Senator Tom Cotton repeats fringe theory on coronavirus origins. It was completely downplayed, written off and put aside as a fringe conspiracy. This was a failure of journalism and journalism's job of\nlooking into hypothesis and actually validating them\nbased on the available evidence as Tom cotton says, \"There actually wasn't any direct evidence\nand there still isn't.\" And yet today nothing has changed but scientists look at the hypothesis and see it as totally legit\nand worthy of investigating. And I almost just got\ncaught in the pitfall, trying to do journalism\nand about to regurgitate what I read on the Washington\nPost and New York Times that Tom Cotton said some crazy stuff, when he actually didn't. That is dangerous, when\nreporters just repeat what others are and jump on the bandwagon because it's correct to do that. What's correct is to go report\nand look into the evidence, which is something that a\nlot of journalists didn't do during this time. And so scientists, even if they believe that we should investigate it\nand the media downplayed it, wouldn't touch it until recently. - Now the coronavirus may have leaked from a lab in Wuhan China. - [Lady News Reporter]\nU.S president Joe Biden launched the investigation in late May. - Why would you have a bad\ncoronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and not in Southern China where these horseshoe bats are located? - Trump left office\nand things settled down with China a little bit. And lo and behold, we're\nnow seeing legitimate, well-respected experts on\nthis topic come out publicly and declare that the lab leak\nhypothesis isn't a conspiracy and that both hypotheses\nneed to be taken seriously until we have sufficient data. It's called science, by the\nway, it's just called science, should look into legitimate hypothesis. But what was troubling\nto me is that even still, there are scientists who\nare digging in their heels saying that the case is closed. - There is zero evidence that this virus came out of the lab in China. - Like this guy, for example, he's a leading expert in animal\ndiseases and disease ecology and he's been the leader of\ncalling the lab leak hypothesis, a fringe conspiracy theory,\nlike since the beginning, when we knew nothing,\nbut here's the thing, this guy has skin in the game. His NGO gets loads of funding\nto perform research at, wait for it, the Wuhan lab. - [Male Reporter] Members\nof the scientific community have said that Daszak has\na conflict of interest due to his close ties to the\nWuhan Institute of Virology and its leading scientist, Shi Zhengli. - Yes of course, he\ndoesn't want the Wuhan lab or gain of function\nresearch to be smeared, like this is his home\nturf where his livelihood and his life's work comes from. And he's the guy we're listening to? Like we're letting this\nguy lead out on the inquiry about where the origins\nof COVID come from? (suspenseful music) Oh and it gets worse. So the WHO, World Health Organization sent a group to investigate\nthe origins of COVID a few months ago and this\nguy helped lead the team. I mean, he's like a world\nexpert, but guess what? The results of what he came\nback with, were not surprising. - A team Of international experts investigating the origins of COVID-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a lab. - And talk to people,\nask critical questions, got critical answers and\nthey've come to their conclusion and I have as well and what\nthey say is extremely unlikely. - But then eventually a\njournalist calls him out. - Given that this report\nrules out of that leak, isn't your credibility on\nthat a little undermined by the fact that you've been saying that even before you came here? - No. - Yes, you can't go into an investigation with your mind already made up dude! Especially when millions\nof dollars of funding for your organization is on the line, that's not science that's\nself-interest and tribalism. Listen, I don't doubt that Daszak is an earnest believer in his theory, I mean, he's a zoologist by training of course he thinks it jumped from animals but this shouldn't be the\nguy doing the investigation. Oh, and it's not just me who\nthinks that this investigation was BS, the head of the\nWHO, literally the head who commissioned this study said that the investigation into\nthe lab leak theory, \"wasn't extensive enough.\" It was too hasty. So yeah, they didn't\nactually look into it. This scientists are not\nactually looking earnestly for empirical evidence. Okay, that was a lot. there's\na lot to soak in here. And I wanna give you a few big takeaways that are like nothing we should\ntake away from this video. Number one is that, we don't know, I know we all hate to hear\nthis, but we don't know. The evidence I've laid out here for both the lab leak hypothesis, as well as the spillover\nhypothesis is all circumstantial meaning, it's like you have\nto connect a lot of dots to make it work. And science isn't about connecting dots, it's about proving something\nwith solid evidence. We don't have solid proof of anything. So please, please, please\ndon't give into the temptation to now believe that COVID came from a lab. It may have come from a lab but it may have jumped from animals after being infected from\nbats, we do not know, we should investigate both. Number two, it is mind blowing to me that a hypothesis can be labeled as fringe and conspiracy all because of politics. And then it can just\nimmediately get reversed depending on the political climate. The media so hardcore\ndownplayed the hypothesis of the lab leak and they did\nso because Trump was in office and he was using an\noverstated version of that to stoke hate and tension and lies. So I kind of get it but we\nsort of threw the baby out with the bath water. Number three, it is\nvery disappointing to me that scientists whose\nmotives should be nothing but seeking the truth, keeping\neverything on the table that has any promise, they\nare digging in their heels, throwing a legitimate\nhypothesis off the table and lobbying to keep it out of the public and showing that they're\nprobably influenced by the fact that their funding and life's work is associated\nwith the other hypothesis that they don't like. I get it when politicians do that but leading experts who were\nall looking to for truth and guidance, like, come on guys, we need to stay open to any hypothesis that has a reasonable basis to stand on and we need to do that so we can find out how this thing started and ensure that it never happens again. - A final note, more than a year ago, top scientists published a letter in the prestigious medical journal, Lancet that dismissed the lab leak theory, they called a conspiracy theory. So ABC news reached out\nto all 27 scientists who signed that letter\nabout a dozen responded, several of them telling us, they're not so sure this\nthing came from nature and one scientist is telling\nus he's flipped entirely and he believes it now the lab\nleak theory is more likely.

    "title": "What Iceland Taught Me About Hot (And Cold) Water",
    "video_id": "QsXM5uUbqLA",
    "captions": "(Seagulls Chirping) - I'm in Iceland and I am on one of the most popular\nbeaches in Iceland, but it's completely\nempty and it's midnight. But anyway, I want to tell you about something that I've\nlearned while I'm here. And it has to do with hot water. (upbeat music) Through a lot of dipping myself, into a lot of hot and cold water. What I've found about this, what I've learned about it. Is something that's probably\ngoing to change my life. Let me show you. - Road Trip - [Radio] Your in Iceland - Look ice cream. - It's still funny. - Okay. Are we done? - Then let's get started. - A long time ago, Iceland didn't exist. And then these two plates in the middle of the Atlantic ocean moved apart and let a bunch of magma from under the crust come up. That magma cooled and that became an island called Iceland. In other words, Iceland is sitting on a literal\ncrack in the Earth's crust from which a lot of heat\nand magma vents out. And it's because of this, that this little stream\nbehind me is super warm. I'm about to get in it, by the way. It's warm because there's\nheat from the Earth's magma that is coming up, and making it warm. The word Saturday, Laugardag in Icelandic means pool day or hot spring day. It's literally a part of their language. And I've been seeing this\nas I traverse this country. Everywhere we go, there\nis a pool or a hot spring. They are everywhere. There are more pools per capita in Iceland than anywhere on earth. And that is because they\nlove their hot water. It's not just hot springs. Iceland uses the fact\nthat it lives on a crack between two tectonic\nplates to use that heat, to do a bunch of stuff. Right now, I'm in a greenhouse where they use geothermal\nheat to grow thousands and thousands of kilograms\nof tomatoes every year. They're able to grow all\nsorts of things that wouldn't naturally grow in Iceland\nbecause they have geothermal heat that they're able to sustainably\npipe into these greenhouses and grow a ton of food. It's pretty amazing. Real quick, I want to say\nthank you to better help. Who's the sponsor of this video. Thank you, better help\nfor sponsoring the video. I started therapy about\na year and a half ago, and it has changed my life. It's changed the way I\nthink about everything and I've become a major\nproponent of therapy.

(upbeat music) The boys are freaking\nout right now because I just told them that we\nare swimming in a volcano. Which we kind of are. (upbeat music) So yeah, Iceland is a place\nwith a lot of hot water. It's become a part of their culture, but is it just because it feels good? - Yeah it feels good. - The answer is no, it is not\njust because it feels good. So let's get into this. Let's talk about what\nactually happens to your body when you immerse it in hot water. The first thing you have to\nunderstand is that your body is obsessed with one temperature. 37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your body wants to stay\nat that temperature, especially in your core vital organs. Your brain, your heart,\nyour liver, your lungs. It has to keep it at that temperature. If it goes a few degrees\nabove or below, you're dead. And your body has one\nreally important mechanism for keeping itself cool,\nwhen it's too hot outside. Or hot, when it's too cold outside. And that very important\nmechanism is blood. So let's say you jump\ninto super hot water, 40 degrees Celsius,\n104 degrees Fahrenheit. Your body freaks out a little bit. It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. This ambient temperature is way hotter than what we are used\ntoo and what we want. So it immediately gets to\nwork, cooling yourself down. And it uses blood to do this. It says, get all of the blood out of this center of the body, where all the important organs are, send them out to the extremities. Let the fingers and the legs\nand the calf muscles get hot. Don't let the heart get hot. So your heart pumps and your blood vessels start pulsing a little\nbit to push that blood out into different parts of your body. Your blood vessels, literally open up to allow this to happen. Like they like open up to make it easier for the blood to get the\nhell out of the heart and out to the extremities. And it works, it works really wonderfully. And honestly, it feels really good. (upbeat music) If you dip your body\nin hot water regularly, you are giving the body, a chance to push blood\nout to all of these places that don't get a lot of\nblood most of the time. Mix that with the fact\nthat these hot Springs are usually loaded with minerals that are really good for the body. And as you soak in them, you absorb them and that\nhelps your body too. So it's no surprise to\nme that not only Iceland, but all sorts of cultures\nall around the world have discovered that soaking\nin hot water is a good thing. (upbeat music) Water break. Ready to get some water. Since we're in an RV, we don't have tap water and\nno one sells water in Iceland. They don't sell just natural water. Cause every time I asked there like you don't need to buy water just go get water from anywhere. So we've made it a habit to just come down to whatever river or creek or stream we see to fill our bottles. Yes, please. Pretty delicious huh? - Yeah - See ya - Okay but this gets juicer. When I've been going to\nsome of these hot Springs. I've noticed that in the corner, there's always like a\nbucket of cold icy water. We're going in the freezing cold. (screams) Henry, Henry James. At first, I was like, why on\nearth would they have this? And at this relaxing hot spring. And they have a bucket of cold water. So I decided to dive into this. Okay, we've talked enough about hot water and we all love hot water. And we know it feels good. I think it's time to flip the script a little bit and talk about the other side of this whole thing. Which is the part that\nI'm literally dreading. Lets do this. That's really cold water. - [Women] Careful - Wow that was adrenaline. That waterfall is so intense. I've been asleep all day\nand now I've just woken up. Like I just see everything in its true color for the first time. - To put in to perspective how cold it is I have a wool blanket and a puffer and I am still cold. Like shivering cold so. - I freaking love Iceland. Okay so remember that when\nyou go into hot water, your body kind of freaks out and it uses all of these little tubes in the muscles in your arteries and veins. To pump blood out to your extremities, to keep your heart cold. When you go into cold water,\nthe exact opposite happens. Your body still freaks out. It's like we're going to die\nbecause we are now freezing. It prepares to save the most\nimportant parts of your body. It's like, don't care about the arms at this point, we don't\ncare about the toes. Get the blood out of all of those places, bring them back to the heart and the brain and the liver and the lungs\nkeep those alive and warm. So now all of your little\ntubes are flexing and pulsing and pushing all of this blood back to the center of your body. And here's the deal,\nyour veins and arteries, don't get to do this very often. Especially in our modern age where we're like cozy all the time. They don't have a lot of practice pushing blood out to the extremities when everything's hot and then pushing it all back to the\nheart when everything is cold. This is sort of like lifting weights for your cardiovascular system. You're giving your circulation system a chance to work out in a way that it never really has the opportunity to do when you're like sitting around cozy all the time in\nyour nice warm clothes and nice warm house. (upbeat music) Dude its freaking gorgeous. Boys look at this. (seagulls chirping) Alright let's go explore a glacier. (upbeat music) I know this is sort of trendy right now. Cold showers, cold baths, whatever. Like this is something that\nis definitely catching on. And the leader of a lot of\nthis is this guy named Wim Hof. He's like a Dutch Iceman. He has all these world\nrecords for holding his breath and running marathons\nin the Arctic circle. Just in shorts and he's\nbarefoot and all this stuff. I gotta be honest. I've been very skeptical of\nWim Hof and his followers because he sort of has\nthis guru vibe going on. Where he's like this\nwild, crazy character. And like he has this wild, new methods. That's going to solve your world. However, I started looking into study after study, after\nstudy, after study. About cold water and what\nit does to our bodies. And I have to say, despite my deep skepticism\nof Wim Hof is the guru and his followers as just another sort of like trendy new\nage wellness business. I'm convinced. (upbeat music) It turns out that the benefit\nof going into cold water is actually incredibly well-documented. Through randomized controlled studies that have nothing to do with Wim Hof. They studied people who go\nswimming in ice water in Finland. And found that these\npeople are way stronger, more resilient, less prone\nto anxiety, depression, their bodies function more effectively. And the craziest part, the one that blows my\nmind is they discovered that when you go into cold water, your body actually creates\nmore white blood cells. The defense cells that\nhelp with your immunity. So people who dip in cold water actually have stronger immune systems. There's absolutely something to this. And as I've scrutinized\nit and looked into it and done it myself. I've learned that it's\nactually pretty compelling and something that I\nfeel like I'm probably going to start doing\nmore and more in my life. The data is there, it's\nreal, it is very compelling. And here's the deal. As I've been here in Iceland, I've been experimenting with this. I've been going into cold water. It's been horrendous,\nbut it's been amazing. There's this feeling you\nget when you come out of it, where you're just like in this euphoria. I freaking love Iceland. So my little adventure into hot water, into natural hot Springs. Into cold water has\nbeen really interesting. Not just because it feels good, but because it has really amazing health benefits that people caught onto. And that's why they made\nit a part of their culture. Because it helped people live better."

    "captions": "(clock ticking) - Let me take you back to July 16th, 1945. On this day, a team of nuclear engineers detonated the world's\nfirst nuclear device ever, right here in New Mexico. It's hard to overstate this moment. This moment ended an era\nand started a new one. (bomb explodes) 21 days later, a U.S.\nbomber flew over a city in Southern Japan with one\nof these bombs in its belly and it dropped it from\n30,000 feet above the ground. The bomb dropped for 43 seconds before exploding a few hundred\nmeters above the ground, turning this city into dust. This was the first time\nthat a nuclear weapon had ever been used to kill humans. And three days later, the\nU.S. dropped another one on another city in Japan. 360,000 people, most of them civilians, dead from these attacks. The president at the time, Harry Truman, was on a ship crossing\nthe Atlantic from Europe, his voice broadcasting across the world. - An American airplane\ndropped one bomb on Hiroshima. That bomb has more power\nthan 20,000 tons of TNT. - The nuclear era had begun,\nand soon the Soviet Union was developing a bomb of their own. It became a race, who could develop the\nbiggest and best bomb. But this nuclear bomb\ntechnology was unpredictable and not really well understood. The only way to keep\ndeveloping it was to test it, so that they could understand\nhow to build these things. The first test was here in the U.S., but soon the tests moved\nfar away from the U.S. deep into the Pacific. This is the story of a bomb,\nbut it's also the story of the cultural shock waves that these far away tests\ncreated here in the U.S. and around the world. From French swimsuits to propaganda films meant to deceive the nation, to monsters and Japanese protest films, this story has some twists and turns. So buckle up, and let\nme tell you the story of why the U.S. bombed the\n(beep) out of these islands. - A bomb will not start a\nchain reaction in the water. Converting it all to gas,\nletting all the ships on all the oceans drop down in the bottom. - [Man] We have spent more than $2 billion on the greatest scientific\ngamble in history. And we have won. - One second. Let's just take a quick pause\nto talk about today's sponsor, who is Policy Genius. Thank you Policy Genius\nfor sponsoring this video. I always thought life\ninsurance was something I had to think about\nwhen I got a lot older. But with a little bit of research, I realized that having life insurance now is a much smarter and cheaper thing to do. If you have anyone who\ndepends on your income, it is very smart to get life insurance, and Policy Genius is a\nreally easy way to compare different policies and pick\none that fits your life. I've just recently signed\nup for Policy Genius to get a quote on life insurance, and it's a really easy process. You go through a very simple questionnaire that is not complicated,\nvery approachable, very easy. It took me a few minutes, really. And then a representative at Policy Genius handles all of the paperwork\nand all the complicated stuff so that you just have\nto answer the questions that pertain to you and your life. They do the rest. The licensed expert at\nPolicy Genius works for you, not the insurance companies, so you can trust them to\nhelp you navigate every step of the shopping and buying process. Policy Genius makes it\neasy to compare quotes from over a dozen top\ninsurers, all in one place. You can save 50% or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policy Genius. You could save $1,300 or more\nper year on life insurance by using Policy Genius\nto compare policies. One of the things I learned in my research is that life insurance is a lot\ncheaper the younger you are, so getting locked into a plan while you're young is not\nonly prudent and wise, but also saves you money. Policy Genius is a fantastic\nway to get started with that. There are no extra fees. They don't sell your data to anybody. It is just a place to go compare quotes from a bunch of different insurers and pick a policy that's right for you. So go to policygenius.com/johnnyharris, link is also in the description,\nto get started right away. Thank you again Policy Genius\nfor supporting this channel, and now back to our story. - Oops. (bomb explodes) - Okay, let's back up and\ntalk about that very first nuclear test in New Mexico. This is the bomb that they used. They blew this thing up in the most remote place they could find in the U.S., 100 miles\nsouth of Albuquerque in the middle of the New Mexican desert. Because this was the first nuke ever, no one really knew what was gonna happen. They had no idea how\nexplosive this thing was. And so this guy who ran the test range, his name was Norris Bradbury, he was in charge of measuring this, of assessing how big the blast was so he could report and be like, \"These nuclear bombs are this powerful.\" He was not ready for what he saw next. (bomb explodes) After the explosion, he\nsaid, verbatim, quote, \"The atom bomb did not fit\ninto any preconceptions \"possessed by anybody\",\ni.e. you can't fathom how insanely powerful this thing is. You could see the flash and feel the shockwave\nfrom 160 miles away. It was clear that this\nbomb was unpredictable and hard to measure, and scientists were\nrealizing that the radiation from this bomb could spread\nand they didn't know how much and how far and how dangerous\nthis thing would be. The director of the project\nof the nuclear weapons sort of freaked out with\nthe lack of precision on all of this. He's like, \"Did we just poison \"the entire Southwestern\nUnited States with radiation?\" (suspenseful music) So they realized that they had\nto find a more remote place if they were gonna keep\ntesting their nukes. And so this is where the treasure hunt for the perfect nuclear\ntesting site begins. - It is the duty of the military services to explore the military\nmight of this new weapon. - So you get these two Naval\nofficers who were tasked with finding the next nuclear test site, and they literally just said, quote, \"We just took out a dozen maps \"and started looking for remote sites.\" Okay, I can get on board\nwith just pulling out a bunch of maps and just perusing around, it's sort of what I do in my spare time so I can totally see this happening. As they were looking at these maps, they quickly realized\nthat nowhere in the U.S. is a good fit for a nuclear test site. They needed somewhere that\nwas extremely far away from population centers and they needed it to\nbe not freezing cold, like in Alaska or something. I'm just imagining Harry Truman,\nthe president at the time. In the course of 30 days, this guy just tested this\nnew bonkers technology, which happened to put\nan entire city at risk. He literally destroyed two Japanese cities and won the war with this technology. From a global control and\nleadership perspective, this guy is feeling very powerful, except for he's a little bit nervous about the intel that the USSR is working on the same weapon. They've been doing it for three years, and the world is generally\nin a state of uncertainty. Empires that ruled for\ncenturies are losing control. There's now two governments\nthat are competing for global dominance, and these weapons, these nuclear weapons,\nare the key to winning. And now Truman is being told that you can't test these\nweapons on American soil because they're too close\nto population centers. So what do you do? So Truman decides that if\nthe perfect nuclear test site doesn't exist, he will make it exist. So back to these maps. Where do we go? Where do we set up the test site? They start looking far\nfar away off of U.S. soil, deep into the ocean, and\nthey eventually settled on this little strip of beach\ncalled the Bikini Atoll. - [Man] This is Bikini. It is here that the military\nand scientific personnel conduct the tests for the atomic bomb. - The name Bikini means coconut island roughly in the local language. They liked this island\nbecause the weather was good. There wasn't a lot of storms\nand it had this nice lagoon that they could position\na Naval fleet there to see what nuclear weapons\ndo to Naval vessels. These islands had sort of\nbeen conquered by Japan, but then the U.S.\nobviously conquered Japan so they sort of took over these islands, but they didn't officially\nown them, but they wanted to. The problem was that there\nwas a bunch of people living on these islands. Oh, and by the way, this isn't 1893. You can just show up and\nsteal islands anymore without people getting sort of pissed off. So Harry Truman, what do you do? You send in this guy. - Mr. Ben Wyatt. - Thank you, thanks. - The guy's name was Ben Wyatt. No, no, no, no, not, not that one. It's a different one from the 40s, and he is on a mission to obtain\nthis Atoll from the locals so that the U.S. can turn it\ninto their nuclear playground. One of the secret reasons why\nthe U.S. picked this island wasn't just because of the\nweather and the lagoon, it was also because these\npeople had already been visited by Christian missionaries. They were used to white people\narriving to their country and trying to convince them of things, and this became really useful. So one Sunday after church, he gathers all the local Bikinians to ask them if they would\nlike to leave their island, and he promises them, \"This will be temporary. \"We just need it for a little bit.\" And people are like, \"Okay.\" But don't worry, Ben is prepared for this. He's got something in his back pocket. He starts to compare the Bikinians to the children of\nIsrael, the chosen people, saying that this is their\nduty to leave the islands so that the U.S. can\npursue their noble aim of testing nuclear weapons. - [Newscaster] The\nUnited States government now wants to turn this\ngreat destructive power into something for the benefit of mankind. - He's just buttering them up with Jesus, and it is so blatant. - Everything being in God's\nhands, it must be good. - So eventually, we're not\nreally sure how it all went down with whatever backroom deals,\nbut under the condition that these people would\nbe able to come back, they agreed to leave the island, to hand them over to the U.S. \"But wait, don't go yet\", says Ben Wyatt. After the deal is made,\nhe invites a film crew from National Geographic\nto stage a reenactment of the whole scenario to\nmake a film for a month. - Crossroads scene 25, take one. - They had these shoots in the churches that they had to have the people there go to church several times so that they could get\nit from different angles. - [Narrator] First they\nsing their own version of \"Glory to God in the Highest.\" (speaking foreign language) - They made this huge propaganda film and guess who it was for? The American people. It was like, \"Look, United States, \"yes we're taking over this island, \"but look at how happy these people are. \"They love this. \"Look at how cool Ben Wyatt is \"with his charismatic, convincing,\npersuasive Jesus talk.\" So the U.S. is one step closer to having their nuclear playground. They ship away these\nnatives to nearby islands with no food, water or shelter, and then the bombs begin. - [Announcer] It is now\n30 seconds to zero time. (bomb explodes) They dropped their first\nnuke on the Bikini Atoll on June 30th, 1946. These were much bigger bombs\nthan were dropped in Japan, and unlike the original\ntests, which were very secret, the U.S. now wanted the world, or the Soviet Union, to know about it. It was like a giant PR campaign,\nthe opposite of top secret. - [Radio Announcer] The radio\nstation will be broadcasting from Bikini. - And it totally worked. Soon the whole world was like, \"What? \"The U.S. is testing atomic bombs \"on a random atoll in the\nmiddle of the Pacific? A few days after this\nfirst test on Bikini, a French fashion designer\nreleased his new swimsuit. It was a two-piece women's\nswimsuit that, wait for it, revealed a woman's belly button. Highly scandalous. There was a ton of outcry,\nit was highly controversial, and when he announced\nit, he saw an opportunity to ride this publicity wave happening from the nuclear tests, so he named this swimsuit the bikini. (groovy music) It was radical, it was\nscandalous, it was controversial, but it totally worked. - The question: should bikinis be banned? - He and his swimsuit\ngot tons of attention, both good and bad. - Do you think bikinis should be banned? - Well, I most certainly do. - No, definitely not, no. - Rather than wear a bikini,\nwhy wear anything at all? - But the naming of the\nbikini is just the beginning of how these nuclear bombs started shaping and influencing popular culture. Children's toys, comics,\ncartoons, superheroes, alcoholic drinks, beauty pageants, songs. The word atomic was everywhere. People started saying, \"You're\nthe bomb\" as a compliment. People calling someone\n\"Atomic\" now meant you're hot. And all the while, the tests on Bikini got bigger and more frequent, way way bigger than anything\nthat happened in Japan. You know, that bomb that\nkilled over 350,000 people. Yeah, these bombs were way bigger and people started to get scared, so much show that the commander\nfor these Bikini tests had to get up in front of the nation and dispel some of these fears, like whether or not the bomb\nwould blow up the whole ocean. - The bomb will not start a\nchain reaction in the water. - Or whether or not it would\nturn the ocean into gas. - Converting it all to\ngas, letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom. - One of the leading theories was that this bomb was so intense that it would crack open the Earth and the core would leak out, and it would be the end of gravity. - It will not blow out\nthe bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole. It will not destroy gravity. I am not an atomic Playboy. - Wait, what, what did she just say? - I am not an atomic Playboy. - Oh my God. (Johnny laughing) So it turns out this guy was in love with what was happening on Bikini. He was just so into this. And after the first test, he\nstaged a giant celebration, in which a literal nuke\nshaped cake was produced. And it turns out that some\npeople didn't like the fact that this guy was celebrating the advent of this destructive weapon, especially surrounded by women, quote, \"Dressed to the nines.\" And so, because of all of this partying and the cake and whatever, he\nwas dubbed the atomic Playboy, which is just an amazing title. - I am not an atomic Playboy. - Okay, but there's one\nmore very important way that these nuclear tests on\nBikini influenced our culture, and it's not swimsuits,\nand it's not even SpongeBob who lives in Bikini Bottom and occasionally has a run-in with nukes. - Atom by atom! Uh oh. (bombs exploding) - It's what happened in February 1954, when they tested this guy,\na particularly huge bomb, a thousand times larger than Hiroshima. When this bomb was detonated in Bikini, a Japanese tuna fishing boat\nnamed Lucky Dragon was nearby. I mean, it wasn't nearby, but it, for this bomb, it was in range. It received a large dose of radiation, and the crew of 23 men returned to Japan, where they were hospitalized. It was reported that some\nof the tuna from their boat was sold and consumed\nby Japanese citizens. - [Newscaster] The\nship's cargo of tuna fish was found to be radioactive and had to be buried in the ground. - You have to understand,\nradiation is a freaky thing. It is this invisible force\nthat destroys your cells without you ever seeing or\nfeeling anything at first. This panic spread and Japan's fishing\neconomy took a giant hit. Japanese citizens were horrified. - [Newscaster] Throughout the\ntowns and villages of Japan, the people, young and old, are adding their\nsignatures to this appeal. Stop the experiments, outflow the bomb. - And when activists\ncreated a protest film, which took place on an island that has a very similar\nresemblance to Bikini. And then near this island, a\nmonster named Gojira is born. He comes out of the ocean, quote, \"Emitting high levels\nof H bomb radiation.\" Are you getting where we're going here? The first thing that the monster does after emerging was destroying a tuna boat labeled Lucky Dragon. I mean, this is totally on the nose. It's not a hidden symbolism film. This film was a pointed\nprotest at all of these tests and the effects that they were having on the local people,\necology and economies. And it helped mobilize a\nfierce anti-nuclear movement in Japan that was already there because of what Japan\nhad already experienced. Oh, and the film was actually pretty good. So the film actually came to the U.S. too. It was dubbed over in\nEnglish for U.S. audiences, but it was renamed to Godzilla and it was edited to remove all of the overt anti-nuclear symbols. The government's like, \"We\ncan't have that happening. \"We're putting so much work into the PR \"of projecting how good\nnuclear weapons are. \"No way some protest film from Japan \"about a monster is gonna derail this.\" So Godzilla lost its protest appeal and became just another monster movie. - [Announcer] Dynamic violence! Savage action! Spectacular thrills! - In the years following World War two, this is the total amount of\nexplosive force detonated between the U.S. and Soviet Union. But when broken down by location, you can see that 87%\nof this explosive force took place right here. So many bombs were dropped here, including one named Castle Bravo, which was literally a\nthousand times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima. There's no way we can fathom this really, but we can sort of try\nto do a thought exercise to understand how\npowerful these bombs are. If you detonated this\nhere in Washington DC, 90% of the population of DC\nand Baltimore and Philadelphia and New York would disappear\nin just three days. Okay, so unsurprisingly, back in Bikini, the locals never got to go back. That was never the intention. It was all a lie, as much of a lie as the\npropaganda film itself. Even if they did go back, it\nwould be a death sentence. A recent study found that\nthis group of islands is more radioactive than the\nChernobyl exclusion zone. But guess what? No one cared. No one cares. When told about this\nradioactivity in the Pacific, Secretary of State Henry\nKissinger said, and I quote, \"There are only 90,000 of them out there. \"Who gives a damn?\" What an asshole. So this story explains how we got the name for the swimsuit, the bikini, why SpongeBob lives where he lives and why we use the word\nbomb as a compliment. But it also teaches us a deeper lesson about what lengths we\nwill go to retain power, or as some frame it, to maintain peace. That's a complicated paradox to entangle, especially when this peace\nthat we're talking about relies on the potential\nof absolute destruction. The race to build and\ntest these nuclear weapons led to the U.S. not taking\nthe risk on their own soil. Instead, doing what we've done so expertly for many many decades, exporting that risk and those consequences to faraway places, to places\nwhere we can manipulate and lie to the people and then\npollute their oceans forever."

    "title": "Why I Left The Mormon Church",
    "video_id": "aTMsfOcHiJg",
    "captions": "(piano music) - I grew up Mormon. (speaks foreign language) I was Mormon most of my life,\nup until a few years ago. - Hi. - I then left the Mormon Church,\nand that is a whole story that I want to talk about\ntoday with all of you. My purpose in doing this\nis to share my perspective so that anyone who is in\na situation like I was a couple of years ago, who\nis questioning and wondering can have another perspective to lean on. I'm not looking to get into debates or to talk about the history\nor the theology of the church. I'll do that in future videos. Today, all I want to do\nis tell you the story of how and why I left the Mormon Church. 23rd of May, 2000, 2009. What are we even doing out here, man? I grew up Mormon. Both my parents were Mormon\nor LDS, Latter-day Saints. I grew up going to Mormon youth camp. I then eventually served\na two-year mission in Tijuana, Mexico, where\nfor two years, I went around and spoke to people in\nSpanish about the church and learned a lot, learned\nto speak Spanish fluently. (man speaks foreign language) - [Man] How you feel? (speaks foreign language) (man laughs) (speaks Spanish) I then went to the Mormon university called Brigham Young\nUniversity in Provo, Utah, where I graduated. I went through all Mormon\nrituals in the church and temple. I worked in the temple as\na volunteer for a time. I was very, very Mormon,\nand I believed it. I believed deeply in the unique doctrine of the church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-day Saints, which is a Christian organization unlike any other Christian\norganization in its doctrine. (heartfelt music) The story of how I decided to leave this really begins with the birth of my son. Isabelle, who also grew up Mormon, and I got married in the temple, which is a huge Mormon ritual. It's a huge part of being in the church. We got married in the temple. We went back to BYU together, and a few weeks before\nwe graduated from BYU, we had a baby, or Ize had a baby. I didn't have a baby. She had a baby. Then we took finals and graduated, like, literally two weeks later. Here we are literally in our cap and gown with Henry, who is, like, two weeks old. After we graduated, we\nmoved out to Washington, DC, and that's when my wheels\nreally started to turn. I started to think, you\nknow, I have a child now. I have to decide how I raise this child and what I teach him about the world. (rolls tongue) Da, da, da, da, da. I think having Henry really made me wonder and think about how I should\nteach him about the world. I'd grown up with this firm\nconviction of the LDS doctrine and its beliefs about the world, which are very specific and very peculiar. And I really started to question, is this what I want to teach my son? And the answer initially was yes. I want to teach him everything\nthat I know about this faith because I really believed it. So, we're moving out to Washington, DC, and I realized that if I'm\ngonna teach this to my son, I need to double down on my faith. I need to go deeper than I ever have and really, really establish\na strong foundation and conviction around this doctrine. I had one, but I knew\nit needed to be stronger if I was gonna teach my son this. One of the things I loved about\nMormon doctrine at the time was that there was always a\npush to ask God if it was true. Not to trust any people\nor any organization, but to, like, get on your knees\nand say, God, is this true? Is this church actually real? Is all of the things that they\nsay actually the real deal? I had kind of taken advantage\nof that promise before, but never really. I'd always been in a setting of pressure, whether it was my home as\na kid or my mission or BYU. In other words, there was\nalways an incentive to believe. So I'd never really been in a situation where I could truly ask this question and not feel like there\nwas some price to pay if I decided I didn't believe. Being in Washington DC\nwith my child out on my own in the workforce was my opportunity, so I spent an entire year reading the \"Book of\nMormon\", going to church. I had a responsibility at church that I was putting a lot of work into, and praying every morning and every night for some sort of conviction. I said, I am more earnest and sincere than I've ever been about this. I'm willing to listen to any answer. I just need an answer. I spent a year doing this. A year. That's a long time. And then I remember this day, I was biking into Washington, DC, on a sunny, like, spring day, and it just hit me in\nsome really strong way that no, this isn't working. I've put in the years of asking and the effort towards\n(sighs) making this work, and it wasn't working. This isn't true for me. And like a switch, it just\nso much came out of me, and I quickly decided that I was done. I don't think it was all at once. I think I had been slowly\nmoving in this direction for a long time, but\nin a moment of clarity, it clicked for me in a\nvery satisfying and, like, very true way. So Iz, who, Ize, Isabelle, whatever you want to call her, my wife, it didn't click for her. She was not on this journey that I was on. And I came back and I told her. I said, I think I am done being Mormon. And I had always been the sort of more devout, convicted Mormon. And she was just like, \"What? \"Like, you just, like, have decided \"to be out of this church?\"\nAnd she full on said, like, \"This is gonna end our marriage. \"Like, you can't just leave the church.\" And I just told her. I said, \"This is where I stand\nand this is what I feel,\" and I felt very strongly about it. Luckily, soon enough,\nIze was on her own path of reconciling her\nthoughts about the church, her qualms with the church, and soon she would join me in this path towards leaving the church. Now, I call it a path because\nthat's exactly what it is. Leaving any Orthodox religion is not easy. There are layers and\nlayers of psychological and cultural conditioning\nthat you don't even realize is there until you start to peel it back. So, even though we started\nto leave the church, we were still going to\nchurch every Sunday, which I don't really\nunderstand in retrospect. All I can say is that, like, we were just, that's what we did every Sunday. We went to church, and there was some guilt\nif we didn't go to church, and so we went to church. But we slowly started to\nfeel an emptiness towards it, and over the course of six months, we finally decided to\nstop going to church. My behavior didn't change all of a sudden. Like, I didn't leave the church so I could start drinking\nalcohol or coffee or smoking. Like, that was not a part\nof the agenda for me. I kind of just carried on\nexactly how I'd always been, except for now I looked\naround in the world and I didn't have a doctrinal\ntheological framework to understand it, which\nwas at once exhilarating and horrifying at the same time. My existential view had\nbeen so neatly packaged by the plan of salvation, which is at the key doctrinal framework within the Mormon Church,\nand that was now gone. I had no plan. I had no framework to\nmake sense of the world. Exhilarating, but horrifying. There was also a deep fear of the cultural and social\nrepercussions of my decision. Most of my friends were\nstill LDS or Mormon, and, of course, my family was, too. So was Ize's. And let me just\ntry to give you a perspective on why this is such a big deal. A quick primmer on Mormon theology is that our whole purpose in life is to come down here to\nEarth to learn and to grow and to progress and to attain knowledge, and to fulfill certain we call\nthem covenants or rituals. There are four of them\nthat are really important to do while you're on Earth,\nbaptism, confirmation, this hour-long ritual inside the temple, and then, called the endowment, and then the ceiling or marriage. If you can do those four things, then you're in really good shape. You have the knowledge necessary to go back and live in\nthe top tier of heaven. And yes, in Mormon theology, there are multiple tiers of heaven. If you're not able to\nget these rituals done while you're on Earth, no worries. When you're in the next\nlife, people on Earth can do all of the rituals\nfor you when you're dead, and then you can have those, the chance to accept those\nrituals or those covenants when you're on the other side. It's a huge deal. I had gone through all of the rituals. I had accepted all of those covenants, which are very serious covenants. You wear undergarments that are symbolic of those covenants that you've made. People call them, like,\nsecret underwear or whatever, but it was just religious clothing that symbolizes your\ncommitment to these doctrines. And the beauty of all of\nthis within Mormon doctrine is if you do this and everyone\nin your family does this, then all of you are sealed together in this never ending\nchain of eternal family that is at the epicenter\nof Mormon doctrine. If you know Mormons and you know that they\nare family-centered, it's because of this. The whole doctrine is based\non creating family units that are all tied into this covenant, these promises that bind\nyou, that seal you together for time and all eternity. If you've accepted those\ncovenants, and then you leave, you break away, you\nreject those covenants, you take off your garments,\nyou say I'm done with this, that's a pretty big deal\nwithin the LDS framework. You are no longer able\nto be with your family in the celestial glory of\nthe top tier of heaven. So if you believe that,\nand you're a parent, and you see your child\nrejecting those covenants, rejecting that eternal\nceiling to the family, you're basically seeing\nyour child go away, and you feel like you're losing them. So unsurprisingly, people\nleaving the Mormon Church creates huge upset within families, like many other religions. It's not just an insular\ncultural experience. It is a deeply held\ndoctrinal theological belief that if you leave the church,\nthere are major consequences. Luckily, I had parents who,\nby the time I told them that I was leaving the church,\nwere very open and loving and accepting of my decision. Certainly, it was hurtful for them, but they did not project that onto me in any way that made me feel ostracized. Unfortunately, that is not the\ncase for a lot of my friends and a lot of other people\nwho have left the church. But even still, with\nparents who were accepting and loving despite my decision,\nI still had years of purging and processing to do,\nsomething that continues to this day now four or five years later. What I didn't realize is\nthat I had internalized a lot of assumptions of shame and guilt and fear and judgment that\nI didn't even realize I had. And for the years following\nleaving the church, it was a process of slowly purging and peeling back and\nprocessing those things. I went through the Mister Nice Guy phase, which is a very common thing for people who leave the LDS church, which is like, I'm just leaving the\nchurch nice and peaceful. I'm gonna not be mean. I'm not gonna be spiteful\ntowards the church because in the church, when you're in it, there's sort of this, like, archetype of the spiteful, angry\nanti-Mormon who goes out and spreads lies about the church, and they're just offended and angry. And I didn't want to be that person. I don't want to be that archetype. And so I tried to maintain very cordial relationships with everybody. I tried to be super nice. Like, you know, the church\nwas really great for me and yet I just, you\nknow, disagreed with it, so I walked away. I went through that phase\nfor a couple of years. But through therapy and through a lot of thinking about this, I came to understand that I actually had some deep problems and\nanger towards the church and what it instilled in me. I had anger and resentment towards a lot of the authority structures that made me feel unclean or dirty. I had anger towards the\nsystems that made me feel like obedience was the\nmost important thing, that submission to a law from\nGod was much more important than self-expression\nand self-actualization. I developed a resentment\ntowards the church structure that has very homophobic\nand heteronormative and misogynistic structures that taught me to think in those terms. A church that purports to love everybody, but deeply condemns certain\npeople because of who they love. I had to rewire so much\nof that upon leaving, and perhaps most frustratingly, and maybe this is gonna be hard\nto communicate the nuance to to someone who's not LDS, but I felt deep frustration\nat the church's claim to have a monopoly over\nthe fullness of truth, that the few million\nmembers are the only keepers of the real truth of what\nGod wants today for us, and that everyone else has truth, too, but through prophets and apostles\nand modern day revelation, the Mormons are actually the\nones who have the full picture. They know what's going on. I believed that they had the truth that was going to deliver me and my family to eternal bliss in celestial glory. I believed that, and I\nmodeled my life around it deep into my adulthood. And I feel resentment that I did that, and that the stakes were\nso high for leaving, for expressing myself and\nmy qualms for this doctrine. Because after all, if you question it, you're questioning prophets,\npeople who are talking to God. You can't do that. It all left me very confused and required a lot of\nhealing and processing, and that is still going on. And let me just be clear about something. This isn't my millennial brain trying to reject authority structures and subvert old institutions\nlike is happening in a lot of religious contexts right now. A lot of people are leaving religion. I wasn't trying to get away\nfrom some disciplined structure. My life is still a disciplined structure. I still have a lot of the artifacts from my Mormon upbringing. What I was fleeing when\nI left the Mormon Church was a structure that I feel\nlike put down who I really was, made me cover it up in the\nname of a broader vision of what righteousness is and\nwhat Jesus wants me to do. It wasn't me. It was harmful towards me, and it was harmful towards others. And the consequences were\nsevere if you spoke up and you challenged the status quo. The culture is not one\nof discourse and debate. It's one of obedience, obedience, obedience, obedience. Obedience is a hallmark belief and tenet of the LDS experience, and as a member, you feel it. Leaving the church is\npainful socially, mentally. You experience a cost for doing so. And if you're in that situation now, which I know some of those watching are, where you know that your\nfamily and your peers will think differently of\nyou if you decide to leave, just know that it's a lot\nbetter on the other side, if you choose yourself and you choose your personal experience and your personal expression,\nand you honor that, as opposed to honoring\nthe fear of obedience. There's some years of pain and adjustment, but there is a sense of\nfreedom on the other side. This is uncomfortable for me to say. Even right now, I'm imagining whether it's family or friends who are still active believers\nin the church watching this. I can feel that discomfort,\neven now, years later, of what are they thinking\nof me making this video and effectively talking to\nothers who might be in the church and telling them to leave. That old archetype of the bitter ex-Mormon who's polarizing and extremist\nis ringing in my ears. And yet, day by day, those\nvoices and those old models, they dissolve more and more,\nand they become less loud and they become less part of my identity. I, for many years, did identify as someone who used to be Mormon and now I'm not, but yet, with time I'm slowly developing my own new identity that isn't pinned to my reactionary\nexperience with the church, but is just pinned to\nwho I am, what I love. I'm a father who loves my children. I love to learn about the world and explore and explain things. I love film, I love animation. I love moss, I love cooking. I love reading stories to my boys and teaching them about the world. I love traveling. I love trains. I love science. I love the beauty of our world\nand the mystery that it is and the mystery of life and cultures. That appreciation is enough for me. I don't have a spiritual\nframework to fill the vacuum. I haven't joined some religion. Maybe someday I will. Maybe I will develop that, but for now, the wonder of the world,\noutside of the plan of salvation and God looking out over his children for this big plan of obedience, outside of that, I feel\nlike there is plenty to stand in awe of and love without a God and a savior\nto create meaning for me. And yet, there's a strange\nparadox within all of this that I have to talk about, which is the Mormon experience\nalso gave me so much. My mission, while I feel\nconflicted about what I was doing and how I was doing it,\nI learned to work hard. I learned to speak Spanish. I learned to navigate\nin cultural experiences outside of my own. I was in Tijuana for two years next to a giant international border, one of the most violent and\nintense borders on Earth, and that instilled a love for the stories of people who live near borders, which helped create my career. My parents raising me in that environment gave me beautiful\nexperiences and community, taught me how to be industrious and hardworking and disciplined. It taught me how to care\nand love and serve others. Those are all good things. So how do I reconcile the pain and the psychological confusion that this organization brought to my life, packaged tightly with the reality of all of the beautiful things\nthat it brought to my life? The good, the community, the memories, the values of honesty\nand service and love? That's a paradox that will\nprobably be with me forever. It's impossible to summarize\nthis experience as one thing. good or bad, and that's okay. That dissonance is okay. So, that's a little bit of\nmy story and my thoughts around why I left the Mormon Church. I wanna hear from you, especially those who\nhave experience with this and can speak about the complexities. I also wanna hear from\nthose who have questions and are worried or scared. This isn't an easy decision. I also want to hear from those who have experience with this, whether it's from the Mormon Church or any other Orthodox\ninsular religion or culture. Breaking out of those systems is hard and sometimes not worth\nit, but sometimes it is. Sometimes it's worth it. And sometimes on the other\nside of that hard journey, there is a much brighter future. Hey, thanks for listening, everybody.

    "title": "Why Indonesia is Always Erupting",
    "video_id": "kqtN794yb1o",
    "captions": "(suspenseful music) - These are all of the\nvolcanoes in the world. You've got this big\nstrip here in Ethiopia, a big cluster up in Iceland, and a long strip down the\nwest coast of the Americas. But there's one spot\nthat has more volcanoes than anywhere else on Earth,\nright here in Indonesia. And it's not even all of Indonesia, this country of 17,000 islands. It's really this belt right here. This is called the Sunda Arc. And it's where the majority\nof volcanic activity in Indonesia is happening. It's where the violence, the intensity, the beauty of all of these\nblasts is taking place. I want to show you some of\nthe most striking volcanoes on Earth, and I'm doing this because I want to try to better understand why they are so deadly\nand why millions of people live right in the shadow\nof these sleeping dragons. (suspenseful music) Okay. Let's quickly go\nover why volcanoes exist. Maybe you've heard this\nbefore, but I'm going to try to explain it in a way that makes sense. It's important to remember that the ground under your feet is actually a giant plate a hundred kilometers thick, one of many plates floating\naround on molten lava. They're all moving in certain directions and at different speeds. There are seven main plates on Earth and a bunch of smaller ones. And they're always moving. When these plates move into\neach other, they make mountains. When they spread apart, they\nmake underwater volcanoes that cool and turn into rocks\nand we call them islands. When they slide against each other they make terrible earthquakes. And when they run into each other and one gets forced below the other, they make volcanoes. - [Narrator] A whole series\nof volcanoes begins to pop up along the edge of the continent,\nparallel to the trench. - So the real reason why this\none strip of land in Indonesia has so many volcanoes\nis because this plate is slamming into this plate at a rate of seven centimeters a year, which is one of the fastest movements of plates in the world. So you're getting a ton of this, which results in a ton of this. (exciting music) If you zoom into one of these volcanoes, you're going to see a\nlot of this dark green around the volcano where no one lives. But all of this, each\none of these little dots, are villages where tons of people live. And they're right in the\nstrike zone of this volcano. Volcanoes kill people\nwhen they suddenly erupt, but it's not the lava that kills them. It's the ash. This huge column of ash\nand gases first goes up and then it eventually falls down. As it falls it gains momentum\non these steep mountain sides. And eventually that\nwill slam into villages up to three kilometers in\nradius from the volcano. If you were standing in the\nway of one of these massive ash avalanches, you will die. And then if it rains, it gets really bad, because the ash and the\nrain make these horrifying mud rivers that cut through the mountain and flood villages all around the region. Okay, before we go any further I want to thank today's\nsponsor, which is Morning Brew. Morning Brew is a free daily newsletter, Monday through Sunday. I love Morning Brew because it is a great way to start your day. I used to start my mornings\njust sort of like rolling over, opening my phone and wandering\nthrough several apps. not really knowing what\nI should be reading. Morning Brew is a clear,\nconcise, and honestly witty and fun-to-read\nnewsletter that focuses you on the relevant news in\neverything from tech to business to what's happening in the world. One of the things I've been following is the cryptocurrency world. And obviously I made a video about NFTs. They're witty. They're\nasking the right questions. It's just a really nice, solid breakdown that's fun and very\nquick and easy to read. Again, there's nothing to sell here. Morning Brew is a free newsletter. It takes 15 seconds to sign up. There's a link in my description. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel but it also allows you to sign up for this awesome newsletter. For five minutes a day\nyou're getting smarter and more informed about today's news. Thank you Morning Brew\nfor sponsoring this video and let's get back to volcanoes. Every volcano has its own personality. And I want to show you some\nof the most striking volcanoes along this strip and in the process, explain how and why humans live so close to these sleeping dragons. (exciting music) First, let's talk about Kawah Ijen. This volcano blew up\nreally bad 3,000 years ago, and left a one kilometer\nwide crater that is now full of this bright blue, very acidic water. The most acidic lake on Earth,\nbecause under the surface there is a huge deposit of sulfuric gas that is venting out of\nthis crack in the earth. All of this sulfur gas\nmeans that when this thing erupts with lava, it burns that gas and ignites it in this\nmesmerizing blue flame. All of this gas also means that there is some money to be made. The locals have installed\nthese ceramic pipes to catch the gases and force\nit to condense into a liquid. It flows down here to where it cools and turns into a solid which\ncan be harvested by locals. My friend Christian is there right now, covering the realities of this job. I'm going to let him show you what this work is actually like. - Hey, Johnny. So right now we are inside of\nKawah Ijen, a active volcano. And this crater is full of life. You can see all the steam\nrising off of the water, this insane plume of yellow smoke, and this yellow smoke is\nwhat creates the sulfur. And with me here are the\nbad-ass, hardworking dudes. No other way to put it.\nThey're literal superheroes.. - [Man] This here is\nSupano. What's up Supano? - I've had this amazing\nopportunity to just pick his brain, try to understand a little bit better why is it that these guys are taking on some of the most\nchallenging work conditions on planet Earth. What is the heaviest weight\nthat you'll take up the hill? - 75 kilogram.\n- 75 kilograms. I just tried 40. I could barely manage it. I mean, you look at these guys, they're not bodybuilders,\nbut they're strong minded. They're incredibly driven and they've got a good purpose for it. - How much money? For one kilo only 1,250. - [Christian] So how much do\nyou make at the end of the day? - 300,000. - If you were to convert\nthat to you U.S. dollars that's about 20 to $21 for the\nentire day's worth of work. (exciting music) - These workers make it into town where they sell this sulfur to factories, which mainly use it to bleach\nsugar so that it's white. It's back-breaking, dangerous work. Christian made a whole\nvideo from this mine and the realities of this work. I will link to that in the description. Next up we have Mount\nMerapi or Fire Mountain. This volcano has killed\nmore humans than any other. It erupts all of the time,\nlike every few years. Here it is erupting just last year. This thing is happening over\nthe course of five minutes. This time-lapse was recorded\nby VolcanoYT and Frekom, two different YouTube\nchannels that we'll link to in the description. The reason why this volcano is so deadly is because like I said before, there are millions of\npeople living around it. And not just remotely around it, like right up against the mountain. Here's the volcano. And these are all the\nvillages right up against it. Which raises an important question I had going into this story, which is why do so many people live here? Like so many people. The answer is that this is\nan amazing place to live. (upbeat music) Indonesia has mild warm weather. It rains super hard for a few months and that rain is effectively\nstored in these mountains. And it provides water to these\npeople throughout the year. And then there's the fact that\nthis is perfect fertilizer, all mashed up and broken down, ready to make this soil\nincredibly fertile. This is some of the most\nfertile land on Earth. You get three rice harvests\nfrom this soil every year because the soil is like magic. So yeah, the people\nliving here are sort of in a high risk, high reward situation. They live on a sleeping dragon that could wipe them out at any moment. And yet, as long as it doesn't, they have some of the best weather and growing conditions on Earth. Next up is Krakatau. What you're looking at here is actually like a graveyard of what\nused to be a big island. It used to look a lot more like this, but a hundred years ago, it blew up. We think this is the\nmost explosive volcano in modern history. 10% of the world could hear\nthe blast, it is so intense. Tens of thousands were killed in the ash and the ash exploded so high into the air that all the way in Europe\nthe sky was red and hazy. Which has led some to speculate\nthat it was this event that inspired the red hazy\nlook of this painting, one of the most famous\npaintings in the world called \"The Scream\". (exciting music) The volcano that grew out of\nKrakatau has kept erupting over the years, breaking\nthis island down further and further until the whole\nthing just eventually collapsed and caused a huge tsunami\nthat killed hundreds. Just a couple of years\nago, the island went from looking like this to this. And today it's one of the fastest growing volcanoes in the world, and will certainly be back for more destruction. Okay, the last one I want to talk about is this set of volcanoes. This one is Mount Bromo and\nthis one is Mount Semeru. First off, these two\nvolcanoes are some of the most stunning volcanoes I've\never seen in my life, but they also represent the\ndeep religious symbolism that volcanoes have come\nto symbolize over time. This mountain, Mount\nSemeru, is named after the mythical Mount Meru, which is a sacred five-peaked mountain in the cosmology of three religions; Hindu, Jain, and Buddhism. It is considered to be\nthe center of the physical and metaphysical and spiritual universes. The neighboring volcano\nis also deeply symbolic. It's called Bromo, which\nin Javanese is the name for Rama or the Hindu god of creation. Every year, Hindus hike up this mountain and make an offering of\nvegetables and plants and animals to the gods embodied in this volcano. (gentle music) There are so many more\nvolcanoes in Indonesia. And my goal is to go to\nIndonesia with my camera and actually photograph them for myself. A lot of the footage from this\nvideo came from Christian, who gave me a lot of his footage. He lives in Indonesia\nand from other places. I didn't go there, but I really want to. I'm now deeply fascinated with volcanoes because I've been deeply\ndiving into plate tectonics. So I hope you understand more\nabout why volcanoes exist, why so many exists in Indonesia, and how the people cope living next to these ticking time bombs. What's so intriguing to me is\nthat the volcano is a giver. It gives abundance and\nfertility most of the time. But sometimes it chooses to take away. Okay. That's it."

    "video_id": "djdU9uyi9O4",
    "captions": "- Oh, my gosh, this is a great question. (inhales deeply) (groans) In that moment, I was like,\nyep, this could be it. For many years, I felt outside\nthe loop on understanding. (claps) Let's get started. (hard exhale) My favorite videos I've\never worked on are... (camera flashes) Hey, everyone, I am sick. But I am dedicated to this Q + A, because I have gotten literally thousands of questions from you and I'm going to answer\nnot every single one, but a lot of them, today. Let's do this. - Can I ask you a question? (uptempo music) - Can I ask you a question? - We have a delivery. - Just cause you, you really sound bad. - \"Fire Cider,\" literally\nhas habanero peppers! All right, (moans) fire cider. (gulps) (grunts on exhale) Well, if that doesn't cure\nme, I don't know what will. What's question number one? (sniffs) What are the top three\ncountries I have visited, ranked by cuisine? Ooh, that's a good question. Um... (groans) I hate tops because it always means I have\nto, like, choose the best. Let me just give some\ntop three that aren't THE top three. Taiwan, Taiwan. Taiwan's street food is so amazing. It is optimized for convenience and deliciousness and speed. And one of the things I\nlove about food is when you order it and then\nit comes moments later. And in Taiwan, that happens. It's amazing. Northern Italy, because I\nhaven't been to Southern Italy, so I can't speak for Southern Italy. But Northern Italy cuisine is excellent, amazing, and very special. Number three, Northern Mexico. Northern Mexico near\nTijuana and Mexicali have some of the best tacos on the earth, in my opinion. Carne asada on tortillas de harina that are so delicious.\nThat is my favorite. Do you ever unplug? How\ndo you manage to take care of your mental well-being as a journalist? I mean, clearly I'm not\ndoing great. (scoffs) - Most of these people are\nnot ready to be unplugged. - I do unplug. This year,\nI have been unplugging less because we are sort of in a\nsprint in a lot of things. Bright Trip is sprinting, we're building, we're scaling Bright Trip. We're scaling my channel, making a lot of content. So I have not been unplugging. And I'm sort of paying the price. \u266a Hello darkness, my old friend \u266a In terms of unplugging from the news and unplugging from global events, I'm actually quite unplugged. A couple of years ago, I made a decision to not be constantly, deeply\ninvolved in the news cycle. It was one of the best\ndecisions I made in my life. I follow the news, but I\ndon't follow the daily news. I read the news once a week and it is \"The Economist\"\nand other publications, but I only let it come\ninto my life once a week. And I'm not following Twitter, I'm not following any feeds,\nApple News, any of that. So that is a big part\nof my mental wellbeing, is being informed without having to feel the constant buzz of, of daily news. (swish) What's the first effect in\nAfter Effects that you learned, and what made you want to learn it? Oh, my gosh, this is a great question. So, for those of you who don't know, After Effects is the\nanimation program I've used since 2012 to make animations, Maps, and motion graphics, all of it. The first effect that I ever\nlearned in After Effects was trim paths. Trim paths is a way of drawing on a shape so that it goes from not\nbeing there to drawing on. And the first thing I\never drew on was this owl. (swish) (owl hoots) This owl was the first\nanimation I ever made. The owl draws on and then it drops. And it's just my first\nanimation I've ever did. - Good job, little buddy.\n(audience laughs) - Oh, man, you've got to start somewhere. That was a good question. - Some honey...\n- Bless your heart. - ...at the bottom so you need to stir it. - Bless your heart. Man, I am very well taken care of. Okay. Since Is is clearly\nhere, let's give Is a mic and she's going to ask\nthe rest of the questions. - Look at me.\n- Sure - I'm the captain now. - [Is] What are the top three videos you've worked on, ever? - Ooh, man. How do I even\nanswer that question? - You must choose, but choose wisely. - My favorite videos I've\never worked on are... I think this one I made a years ago about why so many people go to Iceland, like tourism in Iceland. (splutters) - Why does everyone come to Iceland? - That was the first\ntime that I had gone out not as Vox or just not as anyone, as me, to make an explainer\nand to do it in the field. And it was really fun. We were sort of just going around Iceland just for this random\ntrip, and I just sort of made this video about why\npeople went to Iceland. And there was this one moment when I'm on this black sand\nbeach in Southern Iceland, and I was like, what if I drew the graph on the black\nsand with a drone shot and I just animate over the drone shot? And it was this fun moment. And then I did, and it just worked out, and then it was like,\nwe're in the blue lagoon and there was no one there. And it was just like, just\nthe perfect little thing and the explanation came\ntogether really nicely. The second one, I would say, is when I did Hong Kong, China for, for \"Borders\" and went into China through, and we had to wait in the border. I had to go through this border patrol scene that took forever. And then I made it into China and I just had this adventure in China. And that was a really\namazing experience for me. And it was a story that I was drinking up. I just, I couldn't get\nenough of this story. Another \"Borders\" season one episode that was a favorite of mine\nis when I went to the island of Svalbard up in north of Norway, to this island that's\nowned by 90 countries, but it's controlled by Norway. I went on a boat and went\nto this, this village, this Russian village on this island. And it's Russia just has people there just so that they can say\nthey have people there. And they run this coal mining operation that loses money but it doesn't matter. It's like, that was such a wild place. I was all alone in this, in this village. So those are some of my favorites. Those were really good videos. - [Is] What motivated\nyou to go to therapy? Did you have any initial resistance? How has it impacted how\nyou show up as a partner, father, and in your\nrelationship with yourself? - Wow. - Wow. - I started going to therapy\na year and a half ago. I was resistant. I thought\ngoing to therapy was a thing that you did for six weeks to sort of get fixed\nand then you're better. And I sort of approached it in that way. After the first couple of\nsessions, I was like, so why did we just talk\nfor those two sessions? Why didn't we get to the, you know, the hard stuff. And I quickly realized that therapy is actually coaching. It's like, it's like having a teacher to teach you how to develop\nnew skills in your mind and in your relationships. Like playing piano or\nlearning a new language, you have to practice. And usually having a teacher helps you practice in the right way. Over the past year and a half, I've learned a lot about my mind, about my insecurities, about my behavior and where it comes from and how it's linked to\nother parts of my life. More importantly, I've\nlearned a lot about patterns, patterns in my relationships that are just cycles that just happen. And they happen unconsciously to me. But as soon as you are with\na trained professional, talking about your relationship, you see those patterns and you're like, oh, these patterns aren't actually what I want in my relationship. And here's how to change them. That's a hard process, it takes a long time, like any new skill, but, man, it is, has changed my life. It's changed the way I think, it's changed my relationship with Is, it's changed my relationship with my boys, it's changed my relationship\nwith my parents, it has changed all my relationships. And of course it has. I have new skills that\nI didn't have before. I wish therapy was more accessible and more available to people than it is in this country, at least. I'm glad that this\nconversation is normalizing it a little bit more and\nI'm grateful for therapy. Good question. (slurps tea) - [Is] Have you ever felt\nlike your life was in danger during a visit in a foreign country? (dial-up sounds) (ding)\n- Yes. So in 2010, I was hiking up a volcano in Guatemala with my little brother and a guy popped out of\nthe bushes with a gun and pointed it at my head. In that moment, I was like,\nyep, this could be it. He just wanted to steal our stuff. I don't think there was any scenario in which he would\nactually pull the trigger. And I'm sure that gun wasn't even loaded now that I see it now. But in that moment it felt very scary, but that was about it. I think the other, the only other one was when I was driving up\nthese mountains in Nepal on these really sketchy roads. And there were just huge\ndrops left and right. Yeah, that's about it. - [Is] What is one topic\nyou wish to explore but you don't think you'll\nbe able to make a video on? - A topic I really want to\nexplore is climate change. And yet, every time I think about it or every time I hear\nabout it or read about it, there's this sort of, I think there's this collective apathy that humans\nhave about climate change because it's so incredibly invisible until it's not. It's so incredibly slow until it's not. And it's so incredibly\nwidespread, the causes. And, and, and so, I am always scheming on how can I bring climate change\nto life and make it real? I don't know how to do that. Hopefully, someday I'll,\nI'll crack the code on that but I've been stumped time and time again on how to make climate change, which is a very real\ndooming thing, come to life. Because right now it's a lot of data and it's a lot of squishy, extreme weather patterns, and it's just stuff that, that is hard to, to really communicate to a big audience, but I'll get there. - [Is] Do you travel with your children? If yes, what is their favorite thing about traveling so much? - I do travel with my children. We've made it a point to\ntravel with our children since the very beginning, which is more complicated and difficult than traveling\nnot with your children, but incredibly gratifying. When we travel, the\nboys like to ride bikes. We always try to find bikes. So we'll bike through Amsterdam or we'll bike through\nFlorence or whatever. They love boats and water. And so, we always find a boat. So one of our favorite things to do is rent a boat and just drive it through a river or a lake somewhere. I think that it's a\ncommon misconception that when you travel with kids, you have to do kids stuff all day. And yet, we've found a way\nto travel with our kids to make it fun, to go on a hike. Like we went, we were\nin Italy before COVID, and we went up this mountain and it was this fun activity, this adventure that we were all on. I was having a blast. We made it a fun thing for the boys too. And that, that's sort of\nbeen our ethos with travel. - [Is] What does your\nbreakfast look like today? We need an update to that\nvideo for (laughing) 2021. - Well, I'm making a breakfast update. So, for those of you don't know, I made a video called \"Why\nI Hate American Breakfast.\" - I (bleep) hate American breakfast. - And apparently you all liked it, and so then I made a follow-up about what I eat for breakfast that isn't American breakfast. And now, I'm working on a video called \"All of the Breakfasts That You Gave Me,\" cause I got so many suggestions, like Turkish breakfast, that I am now trying\nin my life that I love. So, my breakfast now is\nstill a lot of Japanese, still a lot of hummus, but\nI'm starting to branch out and learn what other breakfasts there are in the world that I can\nintegrate into my life. And I will make a video\nabout that, I promise. (swish) Before we continue, I want\nto thank today's sponsor, which is Policygenius. Policygenius is not an insurance company. They are a marketplace\nwhere you can easily compare life insurance policies. Life insurance is something I've started to think about more. It's something that I think is just wise for us to have as people\nliving in this world. Policygenius makes it\neasy to compare quotes from over a dozen top\ninsurers, all in one place. You can save 50% or more on life insurance by comparing quotes on Policygenius. You could save $1,300 or more per year by using Policygenius to\ncompare life insurance policies. What I like about Policygenius is that once you apply, the Policygenius team\nhandles all of the paperwork and scheduling for free. Another major thing I\nlove is that Policygenius doesn't sell my information\nto other companies, which is a very rare thing these days. And there's no extra hidden\nfees anywhere at the process. It's just clear, smooth, easy, transparent shopping for life insurance. I'm thinking more and\nmore about life insurance as I'm trying to become\na more responsible adult. And I'm just, it's not\nsomething that you think about very often, but it's something that you can rest easy at night, knowing that you have life insurance, in case some emergency happens. It's for this reason that\nPolicygenius has gotten five-star reviews on\nTrustpilot and Google. They just clearly have\nreally good service. They make applying for this\nstuff easy and very doable. So head to policygenius.com/johnnyharris to get started right away. Thank you, Policygenius,\nfor sponsoring this video. Back to the questions. (swish) (gulps) And now we're back and\nI've finished my tea. - I (bleep) love a cup of Rosy. - All right, what's the next question? - [Is] How's your Italian\nlanguage learning going? - (groans) No molto bene. The fact is I am simultaneously\nworking very hard on piano. And so I have, I memorized\nmy thousand words. I have been speaking\nwith a local every week, but I'm like, I wanted to start to do this and start to really fly, but I feel like I'm\nnot, I'm not there yet. I'm chipping away and I can understand it. And we were watching a documentary and there was a bunch of Italian. I was like, I understand this. - Well, do you understand? - Everything except \"capeesh.\" - But, man, I want to be\nso fluent in that language. - [Is] We're thinking about\ndoing these videos where it's like 30 days of jazz piano, 30 days of Italian language, 30 days of swimming every day. Like, whatever it is\nthat Johnny is just like, I want more of that in my life. So...\n(ding) we'd love suggestions on,\n(ding, ding, ding) on what would be interesting too. Do we have a plan of Maps\nevolving into wallpapers or wall hangings as Johnny Harris merch? - Whoa. The answer to that is yes. I'm actually working on a map right now that is a physical printed\nmap that I will be dropping at some point in coming weeks and months. - [Is] And there won't be many. It's like a special\none, once a year, right? - Yeah.\n- [Is] Something like that - I'm pouring a lot into this map. And so it's like I'm not going to do one of these every month. I'm going to do one of these a year. It's going to be special. It's going to be on beautiful paper. It's going to be everything\nI love about Maps on a map that is printed. So, thanks for reading my mind. Stay tuned for my printed map. - [Is] Favorite natural site on each continent you've been to? - Oh, natural. Okay.\nNatural site...(deep inhale) Grand Canyon in North America, or Zion, honestly, Zion. For Europe, the Alpujarras,\nthe mountains in Spain that are very beautiful,\nlots white villages. For Switzerland, it is the Jungfrau Valley. In A-, in Asia, it is the, I mean, the mountains outside Taipei are just beautiful or Southern India. And then for...\n- [Is] South America? - South America, I would say a little village called\nVilla Rica in Peru. The continent of Africa, I would say the, the Westernmost point of Africa, which is in Senegal. There's just immense beauty\non the coastline there. And then, I haven't been to Oceania yet or Australia and I have not been to Antarctica. - [Is] What are some long-term goals you would like to\nachieve with Bright Trip? - I mean, Bright Trip, which is the company that we started\na year and a half ago, is basically what I do on this channel, but applied to a ton of people making that type of work,\nand doing it for travel. So it's if you're going\non a trip to Senegal or you're going on a trip to Japan, you can watch a, an explainer course that gives you the in-depth version of how to do that place and how to understand its story. I want tons of people to be able to make this sort of content. And my dream is to have\nhundreds of courses that aren't made by me, but are made by other people about their experiences\nand their knowledge. So that's what we're building. That's Bright Trip, brighttrip.com. - [Is] What have you\nlearned about yourself as you've grown your channel? - Oh, man. I have learned huge things about myself in the past year. Number one is, I just\nlike telling stories. \u266a I'm the storyteller, and\nmy stories must be told \u266a - I just am the guy who wants\nto just sit down and write, and animate, and look at\ncuts, and play with music. Like, I am not grand strategist when it comes to building the business, and Is really is that person. She knows how to think about building and growing and strategizing. She's the reason I've\nhired everyone I've hired. We now have a team of eight people working on the channel and that's all because of Is. If it were just me, I would\nstill be making all the videos, start to finish, myself and I would be not growing a business. And so, I've learned that\nI love to tell stories, I will always be a part of that. I don't want anything to do\nwith the business side of it, as long as I can keep telling stories. - [Is] How did you find\nyour videography aesthetic and, and include animation in there? Like, why? - It comes from a lot of influences. Number one was just my own\ninterest in visuals as a kid. I always would film things and bring it up on the VCR and\nlike, look at what I filmed, and sort of enjoyed looking\nat it and the art of it. I think maps became a\nhuge part of my life, just as a teenager, I\nalways looked at maps and I think that paper map feel made its way into my style - Paper maps. - I think that the growth\nof informal filmmaking, with the 5D Mark II back in 2008... (heartbeat) - (echoed whispering) 5D Mark II... - ...to Casey Neistat,\nwho really made his work look almost accidental and DIY. (crash) And then I think the\nbiggest, most important one, as it pertains to this channel, is what I learned at Vox, specifically from Joss Fong, about visual explanation. When you say something, you show it. And you show it and the writing pairs with what the visual is. And that, that seems so simple, but the way that she taught me and trained me to, to write in that way absolutely is the foundation of my, of my style and my work and the value of my work, I would say. If I didn't have that training from Joss, I probably would still just\nbe making sort of abstract, beautiful looking images\nand abstract films without any explanation and\njournalism baked into it. So thank you, Joss, as always. - [Is] How do you keep up your curiosity? Are you afraid of burning out\nand how do you combat that? - This is a hard one to answer because I don't know how\nI keep up my curiosity. I'm just a curious person, you know, I've just like, it'd be like, how do you keep up your\nlove for chocolate? It's like, I don't know. I just like chocolate. (tense music) - Smells chocolatey, eh? - It's, that's how I feel about curiosity is, it's just a deep preference of mine to be informed about the world and to do what it takes. I think that one important\naspect of my curiosity and my desire to explain things is that for many years\nI felt outside the loop on understanding, and I felt dumb and, and unintelligent\nbecause the school system sort of told me I was. And so, I think a major thing\nthat drives my curiosity is I want to make work that is how I wish someone had\nexplained it to me, you know? And so, that drives a lot of\nmy, of the work that I do. But in terms of my\ncuriosity, I don't know. Like, why do you like\nchocolate? I don't know. It's like a, it's a deep part\nof me, deep part of who I am. And yes, I'm, I'm always worried that it's not going to go away,\nbut I don't think it will. - [Is] What is your\nfavorite item of clothing that is not the orange jacket? (camera clicking) (dial-up tones)\n- Item of clothing... I have these shorts from 2006, when I was a cross country\nrunner in high school. They are red and white, just the color of my high school team, the Ashland Grizzlies, and I've had them forever\nand I just love them. And I think I'll always love them. - [Is] Someone just\nreally landed a hard ball. Are you happy? - (laughing) Jesus... Oh, man. It's like (feigned explosion), point blank, deer-in-the-headlights. - (in slow motion) Headlights. - You know, am I happy? Yes. I mean, I'm, the definition of happy, when you live with singular experience, you don't know what happy\nis for other people. So I don't know, I-I'm\nstressed about things. I'm worried about things. I stress about the future\nof my children's lives and et cetera. But overall, I am happy\nwith the life that I have. And, and that's mainly because I have deep beautiful relationships\nwith these people around me that give a lot of meaning to my life. I think the work that I do\nand the success that I've had in this work is a, an\namplifier of that happiness. But I wouldn't say it's the core. I wouldn't say that it is the foundation. It is an amplifier. I feel like a lot of external factors that aren't relationship-based can be amplifiers, but I, I'm not sure that they can be the core because I see, especially on YouTube where there's algorithms\nand some videos do well, and some don't (sniffs), if my happiness were founded\non, on, on this work, it would be a roller coaster. And it is sometimes, if I\nfind myself investing too much of my worth into this,\nit is a roller coaster. And so I try to invest\nin, in my relationships. And so, yeah, I would say\nI'm happy, in a sense. - [Is] Do you have a team\nhelping you make videos or is it just to you? You seem to be able to create content with exceptional quality in a short time. - I have a team. - And I'm putting together a special team. - For years, I've been\nslowly training people to think in the way that I think when it comes to editing and then they've added their own personalities\ninto it as well. And together that's created our style. I have a team that helps edit and animate, and more and more will take\non the edits, start to finish. I won't be jumping in Premiere\nnearly as much anymore as I used to, or After Effects. Although at After Effects\nI still do jump in and play around because I love it. I write, though. The writing\nis the bottleneck for me. It's the thing that I, I do and will probably always\ndo, to some degree, because it, it's what I want to say and how I want to say it. And I direct, I have a\nwhole scripting method that I use to direct the visuals. - [Is] That kind of\ngoes with this question, which is, do you, do you have the animation\nand editing in your mind before the narration script? - Yes, absolutely. So when I'm writing a video, and this is if you're on Patreon, I do, I publish all my scripts and also do behind the\nscenes on all this stuff. So, Patreons, thank you, Patreons. I have the vision of everything\nin my head as I'm writing, and then editors and animators who work on my videos will\nadd their own interpretation. They'll add their own\nversion of what I put. Often, it's super specific, so they'll put in what I put, but then other times it's like, they, it's open to interpretation and they put in whatever they feel. So it's a balance there, but I absolutely, for certain visuals, have a very specific vision that I write into these scripts. - [Is] How do you simplify complex stories and express it with so much ease? Was this something\nbuilt, like built in you or have you worked on it? - I've definitely worked on this craft of explaining complicated things. What you need to know is that\nwhen I'm writing a piece, I am wrestling with the explanation. I'm wrestling with every single word because I know that\nwhen you're watching it, those words are coming by\nat a million miles an hour. Your brain's either going\nto ingest them or... (snaps fingers)\n...it's not. And if it's not, you're not\ngoing to pause and rewind. You're just going to move onc and be like, I didn't get that. So I'm thinking, I need\nto make sure every word that comes out of my mouth is worthy of this person's (chuckling) brain. It will sink in and they'll understand. And so, I'll go over it. And I'll even belabor\nthe explanation over, and repeat myself sometimes in the name of, of understanding. I think it's natural in me because I've always been someone who wants to teach and explain. But again, I'm very dyslexic and, that, I struggled big time in\nschool because of that. And so, I always wished\nsomeone would explain it to me. Once I found out what a black hole was or what a cell was, I was,\nonce I found that out, and understood it in like my adulthood, I was like, oh, it\nwasn't that complicated. I spent 20 years of my life feeling like I couldn't\nunderstand anything. And it's because it was words on a page. And so, all I needed was this visual. This visual helps me understand it. And this really good explanation. And so, I think I have built a whole world out of trying to explain things in the way I wish someone had explained it to me. That, that summarizes a lot of my style. So it's very innate in that way but it's also wrought from\na desire to explain things in a way that someone can understand it. Because I hate the feeling\nof not understanding, I hate that feeling. And that someone's smarter than me and that they are using\ntheir understanding to brandish that. It's not a good feeling. I feel like there's so much of that. And it's like, let's let everyone just understand this thing. - [Is] I was going to ask\nif you had a pet peeve, but...\n- (laughs) - [Is] ...it sounds like\nwe just heard all about it. - (laughing) Geez. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Patreons. Thank you Policygenius\nfor supporting this video. And I, next time you see me, I will, I will be in a\ncompletely different scenario. We have so many cool\nvideos coming up in June about really cool stuff. And I'm excited to share them with you. But for now I'm going to go take a nap. - [Is] If you had any questions\nthat you didn't answer, leave them in the comments so\nhe can answer them next time. - That's a good, good point.\n- [Is] (laughs) - [Johnny] Bye, everybody.\n(laughter) - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to hurl.\n(reel scratches)"

    "title": "China's Rush Into Africa, Explained.",
    "video_id": "aJSD8XV3qzE",
    "captions": "- [Johnny] It's January\n2017 at the headquarters of the African Union here in Ethiopia. An I.T. engineer is looking at\nthe servers in this building and something seems off. The engineer notices that often\nin the middle of the night, these servers are connecting\nto some server in Shanghai and uploading emails and audio files. The African Union Headquarters\nwas built in 2012. But it was not paid for\nby any African nation. - [Reporter] The\nimpressive new headquarters of the African Union entirely funded by the Chinese government. - This building was a $200 million gift from the Chinese government. It was designed and built by Chinese firms with Chinese money. And yes, the servers were\ninstalled by Chinese engineers who, it appears, left\nan intentional backdoor into the servers so that\nthey were easily accessible. The African Union I.T. team eventually removed these Chinese servers\nand installed new ones. The Chinese government literally offered to install them for\nthem, but they declined. The local I.T. people\nalso swept the building and they found microphones embedded in the furniture\nand in the walls. The whole building was bugged\nand it had been feeding audio and internal emails to\nChina for like five years since the building was built. China building a headquarters\nfor the African Union and then spying on it\nis a pretty good symbol of what China is up to in Africa. And that's what this video is about. It's about how a growing\nChina has rushed into Africa mainly by building a bunch of stuff, roads, trains, dams, mines, ports. These projects are a part of\nChina's growth as a superpower. And it shows how this country\nis projecting its power on the continent of Africa. - [Reporter 2] There are questions here over why the headquarters of such an important African organization is entirely the work of the Chinese construction,\nlabor, and money. - Okay, so there's this\nvery predictable thing that you see time and time\nagain as countries get powerful. As a country gets rich, they\noften start looking outward both economically and militarily. Let me explain what I mean here. 50 years ago, China\nwas a very poor country with a huge population. But eventually, they\nopened up to the world. They opened up their huge\npopulation as a workforce for cheap labor and\ntheir economy exploded. - [Reporter 3] China's\nagrarian, urbanizing fast. You betcha. But still agrarian. - Most, in terms of land, not population. - Come on, Michael. - No, no. You're wrong about this. - So now, China is a very rich country. And remember, rich countries\nstart looking outward. How can they project their power, connect with other countries\nto continue their growth? They do this for a couple of reasons. The first one is the economic reason. In the same way that the U.S.\ngot really rich and prosperous and started to look outward\nto China for cheap labor, China also got rich and it's\nlabor eventually got expensive, wages went up. And China needed its own\noption for cheap labor and new growth opportunities. So they started pouring\nhuge amounts of money, like $300 billion huge, into Africa. (rhythmic music) Okay, so that's the economic reason. China grows really fast. Their growth is slowing down. So they need to invest\nin \"emerging economies\" is what the economists would call it. Economies that haven't\ndeveloped very quickly yet. But that with a little bit of investment, could start to grow. Untapped markets. But the economic explanation\nis only half the story here. In China, economics and government power are not very separate. So to understand what\nChina is really up to, you have to understand\nthe geopolitical motives. And to do that, we got to look at the map. Here are all the countries\nthat China has projects in. And yes, I just highlighted\nevery single country on the African continent. I mean, besides this one down here, this little tiny country of Swaziland. They're the one holdout on all of this. These projects range from\ntransportation projects like roads and trains to energy like oil and dams to real estate projects\nlike housing developments and then mining for things like copper. You have everything from\na shoe factory in Ethiopia to a $6 billion Chinese\nfinance to dam in Nigeria to a massive suspension\nbridge in Mozambique, the longest in Africa. I mean, these projects are everywhere. Even here on this tiny\nisland off the coast where China has poured\nmillions of dollars to build housing, a stadium, an\nauditorium, a library, as well as their national\nparliament, try to build it all. There are too many of these\nprojects to even count. And honestly, if you take it as a whole, a lot of these projects\nhave been a major benefit and economic stimulus to\nthese countries' economies. But why is China doing this? What are they up to? Well, in addition to\nall the economic value of investing in emerging markets, China's president also claims\nthat they're doing this in the name of cooperation and friendship. (Xi Jinping speaking in Chinese) \"The African way.\" Let's dig into this and actually see what these projects look\nlike and how they are built. And if it truly is \"the African\nway\", whatever that means. Okay, so there's this really\nimpressive rail system that China built in Kenya. It goes from Nairobi to Mombasa\nin just under four hours, which is faster than any\ntrain in the United States. Which, let's be honest here,\nisn't really saying much because here in the United States, we don't really know how\nto build trains anymore. We used to be really good\nat it and now we're not. It's kind of a shame and... Oh. Anyway, look at this train in Kenya. (rhythmic music) This railway system was\na $3.6 billion project, the most expensive infrastructure project since Kenya's independence. And it was mostly entirely paid for by a giant loan from\nChina's state run bank. So it was financed by China,\ndesigned by Chinese engineers, and then built by Chinese\nconstruction firms that sent Chinese workers to hire locals and manage the project. And now, it's a Chinese company that actually runs the thing. If you ride this train, you're gonna see all of\nthe safety announcements and all of the documentation\nin Chinese, in Mandarin. It is very clear who financed\nand built this thing. It looks like China just parachuted in and plopped this thing down in Kenya. And now, Kenya has\nbillions of dollars of debt that they have to pay\nback to China eventually. In fact, 72% of all of\nKenya's debt is owed to China. And this railway was\nmeant to reduce congestion on the highway that runs parallel to it, but it hasn't done that. In fact, this railway cuts right through like these two national parks. - [Reporter 2] While the\ntrain will offer passengers a view of a lifetime while passing through the national park,\nconservationists are concerned that this construction\nwill affect the ecosystem and the wildlife that live here. - And it's actually not doing what it said it was going to do. So yes, Kenya has this big shiny railway but it wasn't really solving African issues in the African way. Meanwhile, the Chinese\nconstruction workers who came to build this thing were caught treating the\nlocal workers very poorly, making them sit at separate\ntables during meal breaks, punishing them when they\ndidn't complete deadlines or take out the garbage on time. That mixed with the fact that\nsome of these Chinese workers were taking bribes as a part\nof a huge corruption scheme with this railway. And it's clear that this project wasn't actually about supporting\nthe local environment. It just left Kenya with\na giant pile of debt and a big shiny railway. But listen, that's not always the case. There are tons of these projects and some of them are\ntruly helping the locals like this big, beautiful,\nshiny road here in Lesotho. This used to be a rough gravel road and it is now a beautiful, shiny road that is helping the locals\nmove around in their country. So it's definitely a mixed bag. And listen, I get it. China, you want to give a $5 billion loan to Nigeria to build a dam because Nigeria has 200 million\npeople, many of them young. And you want to help them\nbecome a booming economy so that you can get in\non some of that growth. Oh, and you love the fact\nthat you don't have to adhere to any environmental standards while you're doing these projects, which I know you love, China. I know it. That's the business rationale. We're looking for new\neconomies to invest in and be a part of their growth. But if you look a level deeper, you won't just see a bunch\nof investment projects. You'll see a bunch of\nfree gifts from China. And I'm intrigued by\nespecially the political ones. Like when China shows up and builds like a new parliament building which they've done for\nseven countries in Africa. Or when China offers\n32 million free dollars to build the new headquarters for ECOWAS which is basically the economic\nunion in Western Africa. They do this for free. We will build you a new headquarters. (sighs) Well, let me be clear. There is no such thing as a free gift in international relations. Everything has strings attached. So a major part of all of\nthis investment in Africa is China investing in its\nfuture as a global superpower who needs to have friends and has, historically,\nnot had a lot of friends throughout the world because the big boy United\nStates has been doing all the friending by giving people stuff and making their lives better\nso that they can be allies. So China is getting in on this. And China has used their\ncheckbook to make friends with literally every\nsingle country in Africa. Of course, besides Swaziland, the teeny little country in the south that has been the one country that has held out on all of this. In funneling all of this\nmoney into these countries, China has been able to get\nall of these countries, besides Swaziland, to not\nrecognize Taiwan anymore and to support China instead. The TLDR on that is that you\ncan't support Taiwan and China 'cause they both think that they're China. So you have to support one or the other. And so, China has been getting\neveryone to denounce Taiwan and say that they support China. That's a whole other thing.\nI'm making videos about that. Suffice it to say that China\nhas been using its checkbook to get all of these people\nto be their friends. It's sort of like the\nrich kid in middle school who, like, brings you an MP3 player because he wants you to be his friend. And you're like, \"Sweet. If\nyou give me your MP3 player, I'll be your friend.\" I grew up in the early 2000's. In my middle school,\nthere were MP3 players. So, sorry for the throwback. But remember when China built\nthe African Union Headquarters and then bugged the entire building so that they could spy on the leaders and their emails and their conversations? That is a perfect representation of the strings that are usually\nattached to these projects. But perhaps the less obvious but more dangerous strings\nattached are the debts. (upbeat music) John Adams said it best\nwhen he said, quote, \"There are two ways to\nconquer and enslave a country. One is by the sword and\nthe other is by debt.\" It's a pretty intense quote,\nbut it really applies here. So many of these projects have been paid for by\nChinese money through loans. African nations diving deep into debt. We all know that when\nyou owe someone money, that person has a lot of power over you. Especially if you get to the point where you can't pay them back. And this isn't just theoretical. A few years ago, China\nhelped Sri Lanka build a port here in the Southeastern coast. It was done with a Chinese loan. With time, Sri Lanka struggled\nto pay back that loan. So in 2017, China swooped in and said, \"Can't pay back your debt? No worries. Just lease us this port. Let\nus have it for 99 years.\" And Sri Lanka's like,\n\"That doesn't sound great. Giving a piece of our\nsovereign territory to China which they could potentially\nuse for military. But, we are in so much\ndebt and they're offering to relieve some of that debt\nif we give them this port. (sighs) Okay.\" So this port now belongs in part to China. This sets a dangerous\nprecedent that could be applied to many of these nations in Africa who have sunk themselves\ndeep into debt with China and may not be able to\npay it back in the future. So China is growing and honestly behaving like any superpower would when they are growing this quickly. I mean, if we wanted to make a video about how the U.S. has projected\npower throughout the years, it would be a lot worse of a video, okay? So let's just make it clear\nthat China is a superpower. They're doing their superpower thing. This is very normal superpower behavior. Doesn't make it right. It just makes it very normal and typical. China has taken a specific\ninterest in Africa which has led to countless\ninfrastructure projects which have been, honestly,\nan impressive sight to behold but has raised questions of what are the actual motives here. They're not just business and economic. And the bigger question that I want to keep an\neye on going forward is how is all this debt gonna play out? How will African nations who\nare so deeply indebted to China have to service that debt in the future? And what will happen if\nthey can't pay it back? Okay, before you go,\nI wanna tell you about the sponsor of today's video, ExpressVPN. The way that I think about a VPN is like you can connect to the internet but you can route it\nthrough different countries. So whatever site you're on, doesn't think you're in the country. You're in, it thinks you're\nin a different country. I use this all the time. Being able to watch shows that are, like, only available in the UK and I can just connect through the UK and suddenly I can watch a bunch of shows that I can't watch when\nI'm sitting in my house here in the United States. The other thing I use ExpressVPN for is usually when I'm traveling, which I haven't done in a while, but I'm starting to travel again. And I will be using\nExpressVPN when I travel. Because like when I'm in France and I want to log into my email, I don't want Gmail to\nfreak out and be like, \"You're in a different country. We think you're a hacker.\" I route my connection\nthrough the United States which is like as easy\nas clicking one button. And now I can connect and Google is happy. They think I'm in the United States. They don't make me do like\ntwo factor authentication. And this applies to all of\nmy accounts and it's so nice. It makes my travel so much smoother. And it does this all very securely which I also like feeling\nlike I'm taking care of where my connection is secure and private. And VPNs, they're great. There's a link in my description. When you click that link, it\nhelps support this channel. But if you go to that\nURL, you can find out how you can get three months\nfor free of ExpressVPN. So you can try it out, see\nif it's useful for you, and then continue if it is. Three months for free. Go to the link in my description to check that out, to learn more about it. Thank you ExpressVPN for\nsponsoring this video. Thank you all for being here and for listening to this\nstory about China and Africa. I've wanted to make it\nfor a really long time. And honestly, I'm interested in making more videos about China. Not just about, like, Chinese\naggression and all of that which I think is a very\nAmerican centric way to think about China. But like, the real deal with China and, like, what China is actually up to. It's a rising power. China's gonna be a major part of our world for many years to come. And I really wanna understand it. As I understand it, I will\nbe sharing that all with you. So have a good day and I will see you very\nsoon in the next video."

The longest border\nfence in the world today is not between India and\nPakistan, or US and Mexico, or Syria and Turkey. Those are all very big,\nscary, long fences, but no. The longest border fence\non Earth looks like this. It's 5600 kilometers long. That's like if you were to draw a border across the whole United\nStates from LA to New York and then add another thousand miles, and this border fence doesn't\neven separate two countries. Instead, this fence stretches\nacross some of the most remote territory on Earth. It goes through farmlands,\ndeserts, across mountain ranges. But unlike most physical\nbarriers that we use to divide countries, to keep people out, this long ass border was built to keep out one very specific thing, dingoes. (dingoes howling) - Here in southeast Queensland and this is the start of the dingo fence. Now the dingo fence was\nestablished in the 80s. (light music) - Okay, can we just say\nsomething right upfront? Do we all agree that\nAustralia is pretty wild and a pretty unique place? (woman shouting) - [Woman] Sweet Mother! (woman shouting) - There's a reason for this. Back when all of this was happening, all of these continents were\nstill attached to one another. But down here, Australia jumped the gun on the whole breaking apart thing, and it broke off from all the other land way earlier than the others. - Bye bitch! (laughing) - Because of this, all\nthe plants and animals on the Australian piece of\nland evolved in isolation for a really long time, far\naway from anything else. When we talk about the\nseven continents, it's like, North America, Asia,\nAfrica, and then Australia. It's a country, but it's\nbasically its own continent. This isolation resulted in\naround 90% of the wildlife in Australia being wholly\nunique to the continent. It doesn't exist anywhere else. And it stayed this way\nfor a very long time, until of course, these guys showed up. (hip-hop beat) Ugh, another story of these guys. It's always these guys\nshowing up from Europe. So the year is 1770 and\nhumans have been living on Australia for 70 thousand years. But despite this, you\nget this guy who shows up and quote, \"Claims possession\nof the East Coast of Australia \"for the British Crown.\" (royal music) Soon, a bunch of British\npeople showing up to Australia to set up their own colony, and this is where the whole\npristine unique ecosystem thing kinda starts to fall apart. So in addition to what\nthese British people did to the Native people who were living there for 70 thousand years. - [Man] Massacres, a systemic purge practiced against the\nJews in the 20th century. - The other thing the Europeans\ndid when they arrived here was they brought all sorts\nof plants and animals and a desire to do farming\nand all the agriculture stuff that they had been doing back in Europe. Meanwhile, Australia's 120\nyear old ecosystem is like, \"Ugh, SMH, we had perfectly\nbalanced our ecology \"and these guys are bringing camels?\" They also start growing a\nton of non-native plants like sugar, and when they\nstarted growing sugar, there was one native species in Australia that was very excited. That native species looked like this. It was a greyback beetle who\nwas stoked about the fact that these British people\nwere growing sugarcane, so they just started to feast\non all these sugar farms. So now the Europeans, now\nindependent Australians, instead of being like, \"Hey, maybe we shouldn't grow sugar here \"because every time we grow it, \"it gets infested by these beetles.\" Instead, they're like, \"Let's go to Hawaii and\nget a bunch of frogs.\" The idea is that the frogs\nwould eat the beetles and then the beetles would go away. Right? But no. The frogs, or the cane toads specifically, had no natural predator in Australia, so they just exploded in their numbers, and they became a pest\nin and of themselves. - Hey look, those frogs\nare eating all our crops! (Simpsons laughing) - Okay, one more example here\nthat I have to tell you about before I get back to the border fence. One more because I can't\nnot talk about this. So back in 1932, emus,\nthese big giant weird birds were harassing the farmers, and\nso the Australian government sent out the Australian army, thousands of rounds of\nammunition, to fight these emus and to kill them off, so that they could control the population. The best part about the story\nis that the emus won the war! (birds cawing) I honestly, I need to make a video specifically about the emu wars,\nbecause it's just too nuts. If you want me to do that, let me know because I want to do that. Okay, so those are all the ways in which the European settlers\nbrought invasive species to this ecologically unique place, and sort of started to\nmess with the balance. So one of the big animals\nthat the British brought over when they were settling\nAustralia were these guys, sheep. Sheep have wool and meat, and\nwere a big deal in England, and so the Australians were like, \"Why not bring them halfway\naround the world to Australia \"and start sheep farming?\" (hip hop beat) Sheep farming began spreading\nall around the country, as Europeans settled in Australia. But the farmers started to realize that we're not in England anymore. - No, I know we're not in Kansas. - And their sheep were\nstarting to disappear. (mysterious music) And it turns out that they\nwere being hunted and eaten by an animal with a very\ncool name, the dingo. Dingoes are kind of\nlike ancient wild dogs. Man, ancient wild dogs,\nthat should be a character in an anime film, and\nit probably already is. Dingoes like to eat\nkangaroos, and in doing so, as per how ecology and\nnatural food systems work, eating the kangaroos keeps the\nkangaroo population at bay, and this is very important\nso that we can avoid this happening too often. - He's getting mad that\nI'm trying to pet him. Okay yeah, I'm done now. - [Woman] I'm videotaping. - No I'm kidding, that's\nactually not the reason why it's important. It's important to keep the\nkangaroo population at bay because kangaroos eat\nvegetation and plants, and if they grow too\nlarge as a population, they'll eat all the plants, they'll mess with the food\nsystems for other herbivores and the erosion and the soil\ncontent, et cetera, et cetera. The whole ecosystem relies on this balance of predator and prey. - We are all connected in\nthe great circle of life. - So the dingoes are important, but the Europeans didn't like the dingoes because they were showing up to the farms and eating their succulent lamb chops. This became a big problem, and eventually the farmers are like, \"How am I supposed to\nraise my livestock here \"in this wild country with these dingoes \"running around eating my sheep?\" Meanwhile, Australia's 120\nmillion year old ecosystem is like, \"Deal with it,\nLiam the sheep farmer. \"We've been crafting this wild ecosystem \"for a really long time, \"and we're not gonna change it \"just so you can have your lamb chops.\" And Liam the sheep farmer's\nlike, \"Hold my beer.\" Oh excuse me, \"Hold my beer.\" (laughs) I try not to do accents\nbecause it's kind of cliche and I can't do accents very\nwell, but I just love the way Australians say beer. - Beer it is. - And thus begins another\nround of Let's Outsmart Nature. So anyway, they start planning a fence. What if we cut off a giant\nswath of this country so that all of the dingoes\nstay on that side of the fence, and all the sheep farmers can stay on this side of the fence? So they built the fence. It took them eight years to\nconstruct this massive fence, the longest on Earth, and it worked. After they completed this\nfence, sheep deaths plummeted, and so now the farmers are very happy and the Australian\ngovernment is very happy because the farmers are happy. Meanwhile, Australia's 120\nmillion year old ecosystem is not so happy. - Not happy, Jen! - Okay, so remember the kangaroos? - He's getting mad that\nI'm trying to pet him. - Yeah, so on this side of the fence, there's now no dingoes, which means no one to eat the kangaroos. So the population of kangaroos skyrockets. They start eating all of\nthe grass and vegetation. This overgrazing has left little food for the smaller plant-eating animals whose population is now declining, and now it's also messed with\nthe natural nutrient cycle of the soil, so now stuff\ndoesn't grow as well in all of these soils. This change in vegetation made it easier for wind to pick up sand and\ncreate these giant dunes, which then served as a wall\nto redirect the wind patterns, which changes the weather patterns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. You build one fence to protect sheep and you trigger a ripple effect that throws off a balance in nature that had been literally\nhundreds of millions of years in the making. But to the humans, it is very worth it, because the Australian sheep industry is worth $6.6 billion. (sighs) The reason I'm making this video, the reason I'm fascinated with this fence, isn't just because it's so long. Yes, I like borders and lines and maps, but I also see that this fence represents an overt symbol of this\nvery European, Western, human-centric notion of\nhumans controlling nature. We can engineer our way out of anything. The Western world has helped\ncreate this global culture that says that we the humans\ncan do whatever we need to to serve our needs, whether\nit's food or shelter or wool. And in the process, we\ncan ignore the needs of every other organism that\nshares the environment with us. And what we are seeing is\nthat there's a cost to this. Over a million different\nspecies are set to be extinct in coming decades because of our activity, because we like to build\nfences to protect our sheep. And what's crazy is\nthat it doesn't totally have to be this way. So much of our modern culture\nis sort of a blip on the map. We just started. This idea of going out and engineering our way out of nature. Remember that before the\nEuropeans arrived to Australia, the aboriginals had been living\nthere for 70 thousand years with nature, not in spite of it. They didn't need to manipulate\nit for their own needs in a way that threw off the\nbalance of these ecosystems. So far, we've been able\nto engineer our way out of quite a lot of things, but this experiment of breaking\naway from natural systems is brand new and we have\nno idea how much longer the natural world will tolerate it before it really bites\nback against the humans and puts up in our place. And maybe this is the wake up call we need to actually start to put into practice what indigenous communities\nhave known forever, which is that the only\nway for long-term survival as a species is if we\nlearn to share this Earth instead of trying always to dominate it.

    "video_id": "T-_HKFjxVl0",
    "captions": "- Okay okay okay. This is going to piss some people off. Some of you are going to turn\nyour backs on me forever, sorry to see you go. I have to tell you this reality. I have not shampooed\nmy hair for five years. And yet those five years have been some of the best five\nyears of my hair's life. No more itching, no more oily hair, no more dandruff flakes, just normal hair that does\nweird stuff sometimes, but is generally happy. Let me explain. Go ahead, take a good look, I know everyone's already doing\nit anyway, look at my hair. I've never felt so conscious about my hair because I'm talking about it. Okay, so five years ago I realized that I was in a cycle. The cycle looked like this. My head, which produces\nnatural protective oils would be washed with shampoo. Shampoo is just a chemical that attaches to these oils on your scalp, and then when you wash that shampoo out the oils are attached to them and they leave, ridding your head of oils. The shampoo also cleans off any pollen or dust that's caught in your hair. So my hair was now clean, very clean. Oh yeah and this guy isn't me, this is just a stock footage representation of me five years ago. Anyway, then goes in the conditioner, which coats your hair\nwith silicone material that makes it shine, and restores all of\nthat shine that was lost from stripping away all of those oils. Man, I haven't used\nconditioner in a very long time but I do remember that it makes your hair feel like silky butter. Silky butter, is that even a thing? Okay, so you strip away the oils, you coat it with this\nshiny silky conditioner, and then my hair would end up just being sort of like a fluff ball. In order to style it I\nwould put in some product, like some fancy pomade I bought at some fancy barber in Chicago. This pomade is made of, wait for it, oil. It is an oil based product. So I'm putting oil back in my hair after I just stripped it all out. Meanwhile, my scalp is like\nwhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, dude you just stripped away\nall this protective oil that we make to protect your scalp, wtf. And so it fires up it's\nnatural oil making machine to produce more oil for your hair. So now you have double oil, you've got the pomade\nand the natural oils. So now by the end of the day you start you feel like\nyour hair is super oily and greasy and you have all these messages about dirty hair being greasy and oily. - You have got greasy hair though bro. - Aw come on man. - So what's the cure for\nthis oily greasy hair? Shampoo. - A deep cleansing shampoo. It helps take away the\nexcess dirt and oils that can be inside your hear. Right, I reckon we should give it a go and get you washed up. - Let's do it. - And the whole cycle starts over again. In my mid-20s I also started to realize that my scalp was starting to\nbecome like itchy and flaky which is so embarrassing,\nso uncomfortable, and yet luckily out there in the world there is a cure for this. - [Narrator] The problem\nof flaking dandruff can be solved with just regular use\nof Proctor & Gamble's new wonder shampoo, head and shoulders. - Okay, listen, just a quick moment to make it clear that this cycle is my hair experience. Which is based on not only\nmy physiology and genetics, but also on my standards and relationship to society and what society tells\nme to do with my hair. So just to get this out of the way, I'm not here to preach\nwhat's right for your scalp, I'm simply telling you\nwhat's right for my scalp. In fact there's this whole movement, sort of a political\nmovement around shampoo and not shampooing, it's called no poo which is a very unfortunate\nname for this movement. I'm not a part of that\nmovement, I'm not pushing that. This isn't political for me, I just want to tell you a story about the journey of my hair using a little bit of history\nand data and research, and again most importantly,\nmy own experience of five years of not shampooing my hair. Okay, so let's dive in. Let's get some context here. Human beings used to not wash their hair very much at all. It was only by the 1970s when ads targeted mainly towards white women would come out saying you\nneed to wash your hair every single day, and that the dirt in your\nhair was weighing it down. - That attract dirt and\nweigh hair down like this. - And that in order to\nprevent this weighing down and to get body, you would have to use this product. This also started a whole\nnew set of messaging around greasy hair, dirty hair, which even saying it is like repulsive. So demonizing the idea of greasy hair and pushing this daily shampoo regiment was seen as the only way to fight back against this greasy hair epidemic. Today, Americans wash their hair around five of the seven days of the week. By the way that's about double how much they was their hair on average in Spain and Italy. And it's way more than the once a month Americans used to wash\ntheir hair in the '30s. So let me tell you the story\nof how this all went down, because I didn't grow\nup as a non-shampooer. Five years ago I had bought\nthis really expensive fancy tea tree oil based dandruff shampoo, because I had so much itchiness\nand flakiness everywhere. I was so tired of that, and I was so embarrassed by it. So I was diligent. I would wash my hair with this tea tree oil shampoo every day. The marketing on this told me that I shouldn't use any other shampoos, that all the other\nshampoos were the devil, and that this was the\nonly thing I could use to treat my dandruff. I ran out of this shampoo while we were on like a trip, so I couldn't order it. And I was just like okay when I get back I'll order the shampoo\nand I'll get back onto it. And it took a while, we\nwere on some long trip, I get back, I forget to order the shampoo, I was getting worried about this. But soon, after like three weeks of this sort of fear\nof using other shampoos I noticed that the itching\nstarted going away. and that the greasy hair feel started to actually level out. It was actually okay,\nand I was secretly like oh I'm probably, I probably just got\nused to it or something. But the key moment happened when I went in to get a haircut having not washed my hair\nwith shampoo for like a month. I was actually really\nnervous and conscious of what the barber was gonna say to me, and he didn't say anything. So I asked him, I was like hey how does my hair and scalp look to you? And he was like looks\ngood, it's a little dry, but overall pretty healthy, and that was the moment for me. I was like wait what? This guy who sees like\ndozens of scalps every day, dozens of scalps, that's\nactually really gross, like dozens of scalps, I'm just never gonna say that again. This guy sees a lot of scalps every day and he blessed my unshampooed scalp, and was like you're actually okay. Now let me just remind you that I've told some of my\nclose friends this story before and they have tried it and it hasn't worked for them. I'm not saying that this exact thing is going to work for you. The reason I am making this video is because I want us to\nhave reasons to be skeptical of all the messages that we get fed around this topic. - [Narrator] Nourishing damaged\nhair back to healthy life. - Regular washing is the only way that you can get rid of that excess oils. - I feel no grease. - A few years ago I read\nthis kind of obnoxious business book that said that the best way to market a product is to\ncreate a psychological trigger that makes people need your product. The example used in the\nbook was this toothpaste in like the '50s or '60s where\nthe ad for this toothpaste called attention to this\nquote dangerous coating that robs the teeth of their whiteness. Like this film coating\nthat's on your teeth every time you eat, and it's like dangerous and bad and socially unacceptable. Turns out that this\ndangerous film on your teeth is a harmless residue\nfrom food consumption, and toothpaste doesn't remove it any better than eating an apple. So yes you should\ntotally brush your teeth, but not because there's\nthis dangerous residue, and now I can't unfeel it. The psychological\ntrigger is just baked in, I can't not feel it and I feel judged because I maybe have\nthis dangerous coating. This same dynamic happens today with the 100 billion\ndollar hair care industry. They push all sorts of scary ideas about dirty things lurking in your hair that only their product can fix. And they get very rich because of it. Telling you that you\nhave grease in your hair makes you feel dirty psychologically. And what it does is it turns these naturally occurring lipids,\nor fats in your hair which are totally protective\nand naturally occurring into this gross feeling dangerous thing. And more and more these commercials have these like fancy 3-D diagrams to make it feel totally legit and medical. There are medical things here like dandruff is a real skin disorder, that's something that has real symptoms and should be treated\nin a real medical way by a professional. Not by a commercial with a fake doctor showing you 3-D diagrams\nto sell a product. And no, this lady is not a\nlegit doctor, she's an actor. While we're on the point of\ndandruff and itchy scalps, let it be known that dry scalp, which is not a skin disorder, literally means that you don't have enough hydration in your scalp, is not dandruff. - But he's scratching his\nhead, could be dandruff. - And yet they share\neffectively the same symptoms, itchy, flaky, but dry\nscalp, unlike dandruff, is caused in part by, wait for it, shampooing too much. Drying out your scalp by stripping it of its natural hydrating oils. This was my problem in my 20s. I didn't have dandruff,\nI thought I had dandruff because I was shampooing my hair too much and it was drying out my scalp and making it dry and flaky. All of this gets conflated when corporations present\ntheir advertisements as legit science that's meant\nto help you feel better. But let's just quickly say it like it is, the only thing they're doing is trying to sell you a product to make sure that you feel like you need it as much as possible. Where this becomes totally\nbelow the belt in my view is when these commercials tell the story of how you will be socially ostracized if you don't use their product. - [Narrator] Use Head\nand Shoulders every day. - And this gets to the last\npoint I wanna make here, and potentially the biggest\nreason why I made this video. I don't are about you\nshampooing your hair, you probably should, you need\nto determine that on your own, but let us just recognize that we are social animals. We live and die by what\nothers think of us. We strive to be accepted\nby the group at any cost. And my big fear here is that we have given the power of what we need to do to be accepted to these big corporations,\nthese giant machines who use this psychological dynamic to sell us more of their stuff. They have successfully turned hair into a discussion of\nhygiene and cleanliness, and now we talk about this almost as a form of epidemiology. Cleanliness and hygiene turns into an issue of health and safety, which let's be honest,\nbrushing your teeth, or washing your hands, that stuff is there to stop\nus from spreading diseases. I haven't washed my hair in five years and there's not some virus\nthat's gonna pop off my head and go infect my family. Oh that's a very strange\nimage, head virus. There are real skin disorders having to do with the scalp, those should be treated seriously. But my sense is that we've conflated that. We're not talking about\nhealth and disease prevention a lot of the time. We're talking about beauty\nand self-perception. That's not epidemiology,\nthat's personal psychology, personal self-esteem,\nand societal standards. That feeling of being dirty or greasy, who determined that feeling? Who set the parameters for that feeling? It's not nature, it's not epidemiology. If you had been born 50 years ago, you wouldn't have that same\nfeeling of being greasy. It's not natural. And even in 2021, if\nyou were born in Spain, you would less likely have that feeling of just being dirty that drives you to consume more\nand more of these products. Which helps you build the\nnearly 100 billion dollar hair care industry, a huge portion of which is\nowned by just three companies. L'Oreal, Proctor and Gamble, and Unilever which find a million ways to feel like you are dirty, you are undesirable, and if you don't use their product, you will be ostracized from society. Just look at these commercials. These companies have cracked\nthe code on what drives us, and it's fear and a desire to be accepted. And this isn't just with hair, this is with a million of these products that tell us that we're inferior. And if I'm saying this\nas a man in this society, it is a thousand times worse for women. So am I here telling you\nnot to shampoo your hair? No, do whatever you want. You have a totally different\nhair experience than I do. I'm sure stopping cold turkey like I did probably isn't the right choice for you, all I'm asking you is to\nscrutinize your standards, and who is in control of the narrative of what clean even means? Okay, that's that. Speaking of the psychology of self-esteem in the 21st century, I wanna tell you about the\nsponsor of today's video which is Better Help. It's an online tool that allows you to connect with a professional trained counselor so that you can have\ntherapy, but do it remotely. I've been in therapy for\nthe past year and a half, and for the majority of\nthat it's been remote, I haven't been sitting in\nthe therapist's office. And I can't stress enough how important it has been for me, my\nunderstanding of myself, and my well-being as a person, and as a husband, and as a father, and as a brother, and as all the roles that I play in my life, therapy has been amazing. Better Help is not a crisis line, it is not a self-help scheme, it is a platform for finding a counselor and starting therapy so that you can start to make strides\nin your mental health. My favorite part about Better Help is that it makes it free and easy to change your counselors. It often takes a while to find the right therapist for your life. With Better Help you\nhave a ton of options, as well as the ability to, if you don't find a good fit, at first or second or third you can keep trying until you find the right counselor for you. Better Help is more affordable than traditional counseling, which can be fairly expensive, and there is financial aid available. Better Help wants you to start living a happier life today, and I am a major component of therapy as an ongoing practice, I wish it was more accessible,\nBetter Help is making it so. So go to BetterHelp.com/JohnnyHarris, that's BetterHELP.com/JohnnyHarris and join the over one million people who are taking charge\nof their mental health with the help of an\nexperienced professional. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gives you 10% off\nyour first month of therapy. Thank you Better Help for\nsponsoring this video, thank you all for watching, thank you patrons for\nyour ongoing support, hope some of you stick around even though I don't wash\nmy hair all the time. Okay, see ya."

    "title": "NFTs, Explained",
    "video_id": "Oz9zw7-_vhM",
    "captions": "- Now to the latest trend\nthat's sweeping the internet. - So called NFT. - [Reporter] They're now\nselling for huge bucks. 69 million dollars. - So what's behind this latest craze? - That is the question to ask. - Okay, so there's some\nsuper strange stuff happening online right now, and I need to tell you about it. First, look at this tweet. The first tweet ever tweeted\nin the history of Twitter. The tweet was by Jack Dorsey. - I'm one of the co-founders of Twitter. - And this tweet was\nsomehow just purchased for $2,915,835.47. - (laughing) You serious? - And it's not just a tweet. Just last month a single jpeg\nsold for 69 million dollars. The NBA is selling little\nmoments of basketball games for hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is all sorts of digital things that people are purchasing\na version of them for lots of money. There are three simple letters\nthat you need to understand to understand what's going on here. Those letters are NFT. - Now to the latest trend\nthat's sweeping the internet. - What is exactly is an NFT? - So called NFT. - Do you all in the chat\nunderstand what an NFT is? - Does that stand for not safe for work? What does this mean? - Why would you pay for an NFT when you can look at it for free? - Is this a gigantic bubble\njust waiting to burst? - I believe in this space\nwith my whole heart. - I'm just fascinated by it, all of it. - This story is much bigger than a $600,000 cat gif. Or a three million dollar tweet. It's a story about human psychology and how the way we\nvalue things is shifting because of technology. A technology that some people think may revolutionize our society, while at the same time\naccelerating the climate disaster. It's really nuts, it's all\nof these things together and I wanna explain it\nto you, so let's do this. \u266a Now what the hells an NFT \u266a \u266a Apparently cryptocurrency \u266a \u266a Everyone's making some money \u266a - [Announcer] Oh that was insane officially insane Lebron James. - NFT stands for non fungible token. Okay, there it is, that's the explanation. Non fungible token, makes sense right? The video's over now. No, one of my issues with this topic is that people throw around\nthings like blockchain, crypto art, ledger, NFT, and they just expect me to understand what they're talking about, and I didn't. Okay, I'm gonna talk about\na Tesla for a second. Customized by Unplugged Performance to be the most unique and\nhigh quality Tesla there is. Oh and it's not just a Tesla, it's also $20,000. You can enter for a\nchance to win the Tesla and $20,000 by going to\nOmaze.com/JohnnyHarris. When you donate $10 or more, your donation goes to\nsupport two non-profits. 501C3 is the first one. They are an organization that seeks to mobilize the next generation\nto fight climate change by creating a global community that embraces low carbon culture. The other one is called Give Power which seeks to give clean drinkable water to the 2.2 billion people around the world who do not have safe\naccess to clean water. The non-profit uses its\ndeep solar expertise to power and provide clean\nwater, food security, and light to regions around the world. So to potentially win a Tesla and $20,000, and to support these organizations go to Omaze.com/JohnnyHarris\nto find out more. So, fungible, let's talk about the word fungible. It's this very specific word that economists use, it has a very precise definition. I wanna use a different word\nfor fungible for a second. Let's just use the word replaceable. Non-fungible means non-replaceable, you can't replace it, there's\nonly one of them, it's unique. Non fungible. Let me give you an example of something I feel very strongly about. Let's say you want to\nbuy an orange jacket. This is really absurd, I've actually never counted these before. - Stop it, get some help. - You wanna buy an orange\njacket from Uni Qlo. You go on the internet,\nand a jacket costs $39. If you purchase one of\nthese jackets for $39, you don't care what specific\njacket they send to you, they're gonna make thousands\nof jackets in your size, send them to stores, send them to people, and they will send one to you, you don't care which one it is. The jacket is fungible, it's replaceable. As long as you get one\nthat's identical to the rest, it's worth the same to you,\nthey're interchangeable. However, let's talk about\none Uni Qlo orange jacket that has been with me\nfor a very long time. This is the original, and for those of you who don't know I sort of have a strange\nattachment to this jacket. I just love it, I love the color, I feel like an identity with this thing. And it's sort of starting to disintegrate, but I love it. And I kind of fell in love. This jacket is not replaceable. If I went onto the website and paid $39 for a Uni Qlo orange jacket that was this exact same model, it would not be this jacket. This jacket is non-fungible. It is the only one on\nthe planet that exists. It has emotional value. It has significance. It is a very valuable\nthing because it is scarce. There is only one of them, it's valuable to me at least. And I kind of fell in love. Okay, we can put these down for a second. Everything in our economy\nis one or the other, fungible or non-fungible. A sack or rice is fungible, you just want a sack of rice, you don't care which one it is. The Mona Lisa, non-fungible,\nthere's only one. Unsurprisingly, non-fungible things are way more valuable\nthan fungible things. To that's the NF in NFT, non-fungible. Now let's talk about\nthe T, which is token. This is a very internet-y word. And to explain this, I\nhave to explain something I have avoided explaining\nfor a very long time, the blockchain. Luckily, there's a way to understand this, and I'm going to make it\nas painless as possible. Let's say I want to buy\nthree slices of pizza from my friend Anna. She charges me six dollars\nfor these three slices. I don't use cash anymore, so I pull out my debit card, my bank card, and I swipe on her little terminal. As soon as I swipe this card\na message is sent to my bank and it says hey, Johnny, who\nhas an account at your bank wants to spend six dollars on pizza, and that money needs to go to Anna's bank. This is like the bread and\nbutter of what a bank does, all day, they document every transaction that comes in from all their customers, they send out money to the other banks, and at the end of the day they have a tally of all the money that went out of your\naccount and into your account and they can give you a number. They can say based on all\nof these transactions, you have $50 in your bank account. And so when that request\ncomes in as I swipe my card my bank is like okay, based on all of your transactions you have $50 in your account, I can send six dollars\nto Anna's bank, approved. And they approve the transaction. Once that money comes into Anna's bank, Anna's bank is doing the same thing. They're like oh cool, she had $80 and now she has $86, and they add it to her record. More and more your money is\njust a number on a screen. It's the result of a\nbunch of transactions. You don't barter with physical things, you don't use cash as much. So the bank keeping meticulous records of every transaction\nbecomes really important. We trust the bank to do this correctly. So thank you banks. Banks and other middle men have been keeping stuff\nlike this running smoothly for centuries. I mean kind of smoothly. - [Reporter] The NASDAQ,\neverything and more has been completely wiped out. - [Reporter] It was the\nworst day on Wall Street. - What in the world is\nhappening on Wall Street? - There have been a few bumps in the road. With the rise of the internet,\npeople started to wonder. Is there a way that we\ncould do this same thing, coordinate this same transaction of transfer of money between\ntwo people without the bank? The result is a very clever\nconcept called the blockchain. The blockchain. The blockchain fulfills the\nsame thing the bank was doing, but instead of doing this\nprivately on my bank account and talking to Anna's bank, all of the transactions\nare actually recorded publicly on the internet. \u266a You're going surfing on the internet \u266a So let's redo this\nexample in a crypto world. Anna charges me six crypto coins for my three slices of pizza. I go to swipe my proverbial bank card to say yes, I want to pay you six coins. Instead of the bank seeing\nthat request for a transaction and trying to validate it, it goes on to this public record where a bunch of people's computers all around the world are keeping track of every single transaction\nof everyone always. If I don't indeed have the\nsix coins in my account to pay Anna, all of the people's computers who are keeping track of\nevery single transaction will notice that there's a discrepancy. They'll be like whoa whoa whoa dude, you don't have six coins. We're looking at every transaction ever and you don't have six coins. Your transaction is rejected. If I do have six coins, all of the computers\nlooking at the public record will see that request for a transaction and they'll be like yep, approved. You have six coins and\nnow Anna has six coins. And they'll write that transaction\ninto the public record. Now Anna having those six extra coins is now the business of everybody, everybody now knows that. The point here is that the group verifies the legitimacy of every transaction by keeping an eye on every transaction to make sure that it adds up. Okay I'm getting hot at this point, so I'm taking off my orange jacket. Okay, so you're wondering what does the blockchain\nand this public record have anything to do with cat gifs that sell for $600,000? Well I'm about to tell you. So in my pizza example we\ntalked about blockchain as a way to verify currency transaction. I pay you this much, you pay me this much and everybody knows how much everybody has because it's all public. But this is where it starts to bend my mind a little bit, what if we apply this to something that isn't money or currency? Let's say one day you're\njust looking at the ledger and the ledger's like Johnny wants to give Anna six coins. Okay he's got six coins, approved. And then a transaction comes up that's like a Malaysian businessman wants to give three million dollars worth of coins to Jack Dorsey in exchange for a little token, or digital certificate that says that the tweet is now somehow owned by the Malaysian businessman. The only thing that the\nblockchain cares about is does the Malaysian businessman have three million dollars worth of coins? And so a bunch of computers\nall around the world look at the whole entire\nlist of transactions and say like yeah, this guy has more than three million dollars\nworth of coins, approved. They approve the transaction, and now it is written in a public record that is unalterable that says that this Malaysian\nbusinessman owns this tweet. The token has been\ntransferred to somebody new, non-fungible token, NFT. And if there's anything\nthat gets human psychology to value something, it's if an entire group\nvalidates that it's real and that there's only one of them. There are tens of thousands\nof NFTs of all kinds. Some music is being given tokens, lots of art is being minted as tokens and being bought and sold, and then of course there's. - NBA Top Shot. - Who's taking advantage of this. - These highlight moments, these Top Shot moments from\nyour favorite NBA players have been turned into non-fungible tokens. - Jesse made headlines the other day when he paid $208,000 for\na Lebron James Top Shot. - It's the weirdest thing. As soon as humans have enough abundance to have their basic needs met, food, shelter, warmth, et cetera, the next frontier is to create value in things that have no inherent value. The value turns into psychological hype. Excitement around a certain thing. We've been doing that forever, I mean the whole art industry is based on the idea of a bunch of people deciding that this painting, this little bit of\ncanvas and wood and paint is valuable, and thus it is valuable. The only different about now is we now have the technology to do this in a non-physical way using this very sophisticated\ninternet technology that is maturing very quickly. Okay, so this is a lot of hype, and I know you're thinking like cool, there's a bunch of rich people online buying and trading digital art, and there's millions of\ndollars worth of cards, I thought you said that this was gonna have the potential\nto change the world. And I'm getting there, but first I need to talk about the crazy\nflip side to the NFT fad. The reality is that the technology that is the backbone for all of this, the blockchain stuff that\nwe've been talking about relies on the public ledger\nthing that I talked about. That is the sort of heart\nand soul conceptually, but mechanically, like physically what it relies on is computers doing a bunch of little calculations all day and night forever. These computers aren't real computers, they don't have any memory,\nor screens, or anything. All they do is just make\nlittle micro-calculations all day, all night. Most NFTs are stored on a\nblockchain called Ethereum. And as of now, in early April\n2021 when I'm filming this, the Ethereum blockchain is using 33 terawatt hours of electricity. And you're like what's a\nterawatt hour of electricity? That's the same amount of power as the country of Serbia. A reminder that generating electricity usually comes from power plants that are burning\nfossil-fuels, that are putting carbon into the atmosphere which is a big freaking problem. - [Narrator] Facing a manmade\ndisaster on a global scale. - The power consumption\nof the Ethereum blockchain is exploding, it quadrupled\nin the like eight months, and it is showing no sign of slowing down. It is a lot of energy. And to think that that much energy is not being used to\nlike, move people around or produce things, it's used to crunch numbers in a weird computer warehouse somewhere so that somebody can buy a fake token of a thing that we only, oh man, I can't, it's mind blowing. It's such an ironic moment where it's like this is all digital, it's all fake, it's not real, but it's having deeply real world effects. I just wanna finish this video now, talking about what this might mean for our world going forward. This is definitely hype,\nand that's the whole point. I mean these speculation\nmarkets are all about hype. We see this all the time\nwith new technologies and new things that\npeople get excited about. And they swarm it with their investments and the price goes up, and then something happens, for example. - Come on Uncle Phil,\nthis is the '90s man. - What's a web page,\nsomething ducks walk on? - How nice of you to join us. - On equal value, so cash\nin on today's new economy. - It's the '90s, it's hammer time. - In the '90s the internet was taking off and people were just realizing that you could make money on the internet. You could make big\nbusinesses on the internet. The stock market was\nsurging, 400% in five years mainly fueled by so much\nhype and excitement around these new internet companies. - [Reporter] Break the record\nas America's longest boom. - The new economy, is a boom without end? - This rise peaked in March of 2000, and then the bubble burst, and a lot of these\ncompanies either went under or completely lost all of\nthis excitement valuation that they had. - Saw it didn't you, it was down some. - But, did that mean that\nthe internet went away? Did that mean that internet\nbusinesses didn't come back? No, companies went on\nto reshape our world. Right now I think we are probably in that stage of NFTs. It's hype, it's novel, it's exciting, but what it's doing is\nit's pushing our minds to think differently about how we validate and verify things. If I buy a house, there is a whole thick stack of paperwork\nand a bunch of middlemen to make sure that it is very clear who owns the house, and how that money gets transferred from one person to another. It is a nightmare of an experience. If suddenly technology\nexisted that took away the centralized middle man and made transactions between people able to be authenticated, verifiable, and much smoother, that\ncould change our world. I'm not here to say if\nthe bubble's gonna burst, or whatever, I don't know. I just know that this is a crazy moment where we're getting our\nheads around a new technology and what it means, and eventually will adapt. This won't be crazy, this\nwon't be novel anymore, prices will go down, but the technology that\nallowed it all to happen will probably stick around. (soft music)"

    "title": "The REAL Reason McDonalds Ice Cream Machines Are Always Broken",
    "video_id": "SrDEtSlqJC4",
    "captions": "- Have you heard the conspiracy about McDonald's, about their ice cream. - What about it? (gentle upbeat music) (loud sigh) - Okay. So I've been\ninvestigating something for a long time. Probably deeper than I've\ngone on any other video for a while at least. Something I never thought\nI would be investigating, but I am. I'm investigating McDonald's\nice cream machines. Who wants to go get ice cream. - Me! - [McDonald Attendant]\nHello, can I take your order? - Can I get an ice cream cone? - [McDonald Attendant] We\ndon't have ice cream right now. - Not today. - [McDonald Attendant] Not today. - Maybe tomorrow or something? - [McDonald Attendant] Or\nnext week, I don't know. - Does that happen a lot? Like that, the machine's down. - [McDonald Attendant]\nYeah. In this store yeah. - Okay. For a few years now people have taken notice\nthat the ice cream machines at McDonald's always seem to be down. - [Woman] The ice cream\nmachine part is not working. - The broken ice cream machines at McDonald's have been the fodder for a lot of weird internet culture. One guy even made an\ninteractive map that shows every single McDonald's that\nhas a broken ice cream machine, at this current moment. - So I reverse engineered the Android app. I think it was like, it was a meme but nobody actually knew if\nthis meme was correct or not, but they didn't know that was like an, actual thing that all the\nfranchises are struggling with. - But a couple months ago, I got an email from a guy who said that\nhe had a deeper story. He said that they're important questions that no one is asking, and he promised me answers\nto those questions, and data and evidence to back it up. He even said that there's potentially, something nefarious going on here. - I was like, \"Okay, cool. Another conspiracy theory about these McDonald's ice cream makers.\" So I asked my producer,\nJack, to get on the phone with this guy and hear him out. A week later, Jack called me. - [Jack] And there's actually\nsomething going on here. I've been going through everything and you really need to see this. - Okay. I was still highly skeptical that this could be anything worth\na video or an investigation, but I decided to dive in\nanyway and see this evidence for myself. I started looking at data at\ninternal McDonald's emails. At these mind numbing, 100\npage instruction manuals for ice cream makers. I started talking to\nMcDonald's franchise owners and managers, and guess, it\nturns out there is something really weird going on here. Something that hasn't\nbeen reported on before and something that shows that McDonald's broken ice cream machines actually reveal a bigger story about how big businesses protect one another. Even if that means\nhurting their customers. I never thought I'd be going\ndown a deep investigation into ice cream makers, but I am. And I did. And I wanna share with you what I learned. (upbeat music) - McDonald's is getting on (beep) nerves. - And that machine is always down. - The ice cream machine is broken. - And if you tried to pull\nthe lever, this what happens. (loud whirring) - Sorry, the ice cream machine is broken. The broken McDonald's ice\ncream machine epidemic has been so widespread for\nso long that it's a meme. - [Man] You know what they're gonna say. You already know, \"The ice\ncream machine is broken.\" (hiphop music) - Ice cream machine is broken. (hiphop music) Kinda sounds like there's\na story behind that one, doesn't it? (crowd laughing) (gentle music) - In this very moment, if you look at McBroken, around 13% of ice cream makers in the\nUnited States are not working. That's any red dot on this map. What a brilliant little tool Rashiq made. I mean, this is just so good. So Jack, why are the ice\ncream machines always broken? - So once the internet\nstarted to notice this, the Wall Street Journal\nand Business Insider and a bunch of other outlets\nstarted to report on it. And the conclusion that they came to was that these machines\naren't actually broken, they're just going through a really long and really complicated cleaning cycle that lasts four hours at a time. And when that happens, the\nemployees tell you it's broken because it's just easier. But, don't take my word for it. - So when you go there and they tell you it's broken, there's a high chance it's not broken, it's just shut up for maintenance. - Okay. So human error and\nthis long cleaning cycle, that was the conclusion\nthat like everyone came to and everyone seemed to\nbe satisfied with that. I mean, I would be satisfied with that. It's a pretty tight conclusion,\nbut hold on a second. Wait a minute. (upbeat music) - Do you guys have Frosties? - [Wendy's Attendant] Yeah. - I was just at McDonald's and the ice cream machine was broken and it seems like it always is. Is the ice cream machine\nbroken here very often? - [Wendy's Attendant] No. Yeah. That's what McDonald's problem. We wash our machines every single-- - Oh, that's cool. Is it easy to do that or\nis it pretty complicated? - [Wendy's Attendant] No,\nit's actually really easy to clean it. They're just lazy. (Johnny laughing) It's the honest truth. That's the honest truth. - So, Wendy's doesn't have this problem. And what's crazy is that they\nuse the same brand of machine as McDonald's does, and yet\nthey don't have a McBroken. It's not an internet\nmeme for them, nor is it for other places that use the\nsame brand of ice cream maker, like In-N-Out or Chick-fil-A\nor a bunch of others. So, why is it only\nMcDonald's that has a problem with the broken ice cream maker? - [Attendant] That's\nonly a McDonald's thing. We don't have that issue. - You don't have that issue here. - [Attendant] I promise. (Johnny laughing) (gentle music) - If you want a real answer on this, you need to talk to the\npeople who suffer the most when these machines' broken, which actually isn't McDonald's corporate, it's the people who own\nthese individual restaurants or franchises. These are the people who pay the price in lost revenue, when\nthe machine is broken. So I talk to them. I talked to managers who actually\ndeal with broken machines and I also went deep in this\n111 page owner's manual, which is not a read I recommend but I will summarize what it says. (gentle upbeat music) What I've found is as mind\nboggling as it is infuriating. To understand this, you have to understand how these ice cream machines\nwork, and why they break. So I ask you to bear with me as we learn how an ice cream machine at McDonald's works, and\nwhy they always break. Once you understand that you will understand who is\ngetting rich every time one of these things breaks, and why they have an\nincentive to keep them broken. (bright hiphop music) - And I was like, \"Okay. I'm gonna guess it's\ngonna be around like 5%. And it came back to like\n13%, which is insane. - One question that needs to be asked is, \"Should you be building\nice cream machines, if after 17 years you still\ncan't get the software right?\" (hiphop music) - [Wendy's Attendant] No. Yeah,\nthat's a McDonald's problem. - Okay. Really quick. I just wanna talk about life insurance. Something we don't really\nwanna talk about very often but we should probably talk about it. In fact, for the past a year and a half, I've been trying to get life insurance and I haven't been getting\nit because I've been like \"How do I even get life insurance? And what even is life insurance?\" And all of that. The sponsor of today's\nvideo answers that question. Policygenius is a marketplace where you can go and shop around\nand save on life insurance. Did you know that the younger you are, the\ncheaper life insurance is. Most of you are young\nand therefore most of you could lock in a really\ngood life insurance rate for the next 20, 30 years. These are the smart things to have to plan for the future. Policygenius isn't an insurance company, they're just a marketplace. They're just a place where you can go and choose from a bunch\nof different plans. And then, they handle all the paperwork which like for someone like\nme, who hates paperwork that is a huge benefit. I'm going through this process right now. Like, I'm not kidding. I'm not just saying this\nlike for the sponsorship. I'm literally going through\nthis process right now because of Policygenius and\nI'm getting life insurance because I think I need to be smart, like a smart adult and do this. And I'm young, so my rate is gonna be\nactually quite affordable. And one of my favorite parts about this whole thing\nis that Policygenius doesn't sell my data and\ninformation to other companies which is actually a really\nrare thing nowadays. So, thank you Policygenius for that. So, go to policygenius.com/johnnyharris to shop the marketplace and\nstart saving money today. You could save $1,300 or more per year by using Policygenius to\ncompare life insurance policies. You could save 50% or\nmore on life insurance by comparing quotes with Policygenius. I love when old legacy\nindustries get updated to new modern companies that\nare more seamless and smarter and that are on the internet, and that's what Policygenius is. So, go check it out, get life insurance. That's what I'm doing right now. Let's get back to\nMcDonald's ice cream makers. If somebody said, I have\na product that 10% or 12% of the time, it's not functioning from an interest standard standpoint, what does it look like? - That's not good at all. Being down for 10% all the time, that's like, no, you can't do that. - So, let's look at the\nmachine in question here. It's this guy, the C602. It's made by a company called Taylor. This machine is made\nspecifically for McDonald's. Taylor is like an OG\npartner at McDonald's. They've been doing business together since the very beginning of McDonald's. They're both based like a few miles away from each other in Illinois. They are old business\npartners going back decades. But like I said, Taylor makes\nice cream machines for a bunch of other fast food restaurants\nlike Wendy and Chick-fil-A, and those machines aren't\nbroken all the time. So it's something very specific\nto McDonald's and Taylor that explains the ice cream machine issue. If you wanna start a McDonald's franchise, you sign an agreement with McDonald's corporate that says, \"I'm gonna open a restaurant and I'll make sure that\neverything is standardized.\" It's a part of this\nagreement that says you have to use this kind of French fry and you have to use one\nof two different companies for your fryer and your grill or whatever. When this new ice cream\nmachine came out in 2003, McDonald's had it in their agreement with all their franchises,\nwhich is like 16,000 in the United States, that\nthey had to use this machine. No other machine. They could not use any\nother machine on the planet, They had to use the C602 made\nby McDonald's and Taylor. It was in their agreement. Usually franchisees can pick between multiple different companies for their gear in their store. Not in this case, you had to use the C602. So, let's dive into this machine. (hiphop music) Ice cream is dairy, and dairy needs to be kept at a certain temperature to stay safe. The machine itself has all these\npipes that have dairy going through it all the time. So what they do once\nper day is they heat up the whole machine, including\nthe ice cream mixture to like 151 degrees Fahrenheit. They leave it at that\ntemperature for awhile, while it kills off all the bacteria, and then it comes back down\nto a freezing temperature where it turns into ice cream. That process takes about four hours. And this is the thing that\nyou hear about all the time as the explanation for why\nthe machine is always down. (gentle music) But here's the nuance here\nthat really illuminates the story. Usually, the employees do this overnight, while the store is closed. Someone in the night shift\ngets the cleaning cycle going, and then they lock up for the night. The next morning, new employees who are opening\nthe store for the morning, show up, and they look\nat the ice cream machine. And on the screen, they\nusually see one of two things. \"Heat cycle was successful.\" The ice cream machine is ready to use. Or, \"Heat cycle failed.\" They don't know exactly why the\nheat cycle failed overnight, they're looking at this\ninterface that looks like it's from like 1983, and all they see is something like, \"Heat mode failure,\" or some other obscure code that doesn't really\ntell you what happened. The machine is completely locked out until you successfully run\none of these heat cycles. You have to run heat cycle. Even if the heat cycle missed one of these benchmarks by like one degree, it's still just gonna\ntell you the thing failed. Doesn't tell you why or by how much. So the employee tells their manager, the manager has no idea\nwhy the heat cycle failed, and so they just tell\ntheir employee to like, \"Run it again.\" Luckily it's the morning, so, people aren't getting ice cream yet, but like run the heat cycle again. So, employee runs the heat\ncycle again and it fails again, probably for the same reason\nit failed in the first place, which nobody knows at this point. PS, as a C602 ice cream machine insider, the reason why it failed\nprobably is because the hopper is a little bit too full of the ice cream mix and it takes a while for\nit to heat up and cool down that massive matter. So, just fill it a little\nbit less next time. That's one of many\nreasons why it might fail. Anyway, nobody knows this, because they're just sitting there trying to serve customers. I worked in fast food in high school, it's a chaotic world. You're just trying to make people happy. Meanwhile, the person's trying\nto like run the heat cycle, it fails again. So the heat cycle fails again. Manager's pissed, you have angry people asking for ice cream and everyone's just saying like, \"Yeah, the ice cream machines down. Sorry, we can't do anything about it.\" So, finally, the manager\ncalls the franchise owner, the owner of the business and says, \"What do we do?\" And the franchise owner says, \"We need to get ice cream sales going. This is not okay. We're losing money. Just call the guy.\" (suspenseful music) Just call the guy. That's verbatim, what one of the franchise owners told me. He said, \"When things are crazy I just tell them to just call the guy.\" Now we're getting to the heart of this. The guy in this case\nmeans one guy or woman, which is an authorized service\ntechnician from Taylor, the company who makes the machine. Remember this? - [Male Attendant] The ice cream machine isn't working right now. (dramatic music) - No, I'm just hear here to\nfix the ice cream machine. - Okay. - You're from Taylor? - Yes. - Okay, 'cause I've\nnever seen with a uniform that why I'm a little bit-- - Okay. Yeah. I always switch things up. - Oh. So you're still Taylor? - Yes ma'am. - Okay. - Turns out that Taylor is the only company that\nis authorized to repair and maintain these machines. It's in their contract. If you call anyone else, but Taylor, first off they wouldn't know how to use it 'cause it's such a\nstrange esoteric machine, but also you would void your\ncontract, your warranty. So you call the service technician, he or she comes to fix the machine. We got our hands on some actual invoices that show how much these\nTaylor repair people cost. It's different in every\nmarket and for every scenario but somewhere to the tune of\n$144 for the first 30 minutes. And then up to hundreds of dollars for each additional 15 minutes thereafter. So the desperate franchise owner, the one who runs the\nbusiness has to decide, \"Do I deal with angry\ncustomers who are yelling at me 'cause they don't have ice\ncream, or do I just call the guy and get them to come\nrepair this at any cost? It doesn't matter.\" So these franchise owners end up paying thousands\nand thousands of dollars, not because their employees are competent, or they're bad at training, but because this machine locks them out and they have no idea why. They're looking at a screen\nthat looks like this, and all roads point to, \"Call the service technician.\" I watched a bunch of\nadvertisements for Taylor company, people who make this ice cream machine and do all the maintenance on it, they hardly talk about their product here. Their advertisements are more about how great their repairs team is. - [Advertiser] Innovators\ndon't build machines. They solve problems. This is an expert technician. There are 6,500 Taylor\ntechnicians worldwide ready to help you. The Taylor company! (upbeat music) - A few years ago, Taylor\nwas in talks to be acquired by another company called Middleby. They put together a pitch\ndeck of all their financials to sort of say, like, \"Look at how good our business is.\" And on that pitch deck, they stated that 25%\nof their revenue comes from this repair and parts\nservice of their business. Yes, they make ice cream machines, but a quarter of their business comes from just maintenance and repairs. This sort of reoccurring revenue, revenue you can rely on month after month, is like gold for investors. People love this because this is like, you can project how much money\nyou're gonna get every month, if you can rely on a\ncertain channel of revenue in your business. Taylor can rely on services and repairs from McDonald's ice cream machines. Remember, up until just\na couple of years ago, for years and years, McDonald's franchises were only allowed to use Taylor machines. They had no options. They couldn't be like, \"Wow, this machine sucks. I'm gonna go somewhere else.\" So they had to use the machines, regardless, and they had to use this specific machine that breaks all of the time. - [Taylor Advertiser] Their\nparts and service network, is what makes Taylor the company of choice for the food service industry. - No matter what time of the (beep) day the ice machine is broke. How? - [Mom] McDonald's is making my baby cry. - How? - We got our hands on\nthe software for some of these machines, to see how Taylor has tried to improve the software component. You would imagine that with a machine that is\nnotoriously broken all the time, it would update their software\nto give more useful feedback to the user like, \"Hey your cleaning cycle failed last night only by one degree, and that's probably because\nyour hopper was too full. Try to fill it a little\nbit less next time.\" Alas. No. Since 2003, when this thing came out there have been quite\na few software updates. But instead of improving\nusability of the software, the software has actually\nintroduced just new sets of cryptic error codes that don't help anyone solve any problems. I have spent hours in\nthis instruction manual going through all of the error\ncodes and what they mean. I feel like maybe just maybe, after reading this multiple\ntimes and like being in the weeds, I could\noperate one of these machines and maybe understand what's\ngoing on when things fail. But it is clear to me that\nthis machine is not set up for the user to have success in diagnosing and fixing the problem. One person I was talking to was like, they had just opened a store and they, it was a brand new store,\na brand new machine. And they're like, \"Yeah, in the first few months we called the guy like\nfour or five times.\" (chuckling) I am blown away that a product like this, with software this cryptic and horrible, can exist in 2021. The menus are horribly complicated. The error codes are not helpful. The buttons don't have words on them, instead they're just\nlike a bunch of symbols. Like it's like press the flavor button, press the ice cream button. To get to here, like to access this menu, press these two buttons at the same time. It's like, \"How could you ever expect somebody, especially like an entry-level employee, who's been on the job for like a few days to understand any of this.\" It is a product that is set up to fail and that has no incentive to improve, because what this means for Taylor is simply more services and\nrepairs for their pocket. 25% of their entire\nbusiness is based on this. And then there's the secret menu. (bright hiphop music) In addition to the instruction\nmanual that's given to users, I also got a hold of the service manual that is given to the Taylor service people; like this is like the insider manual that gives you the whole\npicture on this machine. I do not recommend you read it. In this manual, you learn about a separate menu\nfor the service technicians. It's called the Service Menu. This one is not accessible to the user; the person who owns the\nmachine, the franchise owner. It's only accessible to the service techs who have\nvery specific code for it. The existence of this\nservice menu is found nowhere in the user manual; the thing given to the\nperson who owns the machine. And yet, according to this\nmanual, this menu contains quote, \"Critical operating\nparameters for the machine.\" So wait, if this machine is breaking all of the time and you have a franchise owner who's trying to keep\ntheir customers happy, and there's a menu where there are quote, \"Critical operating parameters,\" that the owner doesn't have access to, just call the guy. Just call the guy. The machine is not meant to\ngive the user a clear picture on why it's breaking. A few weeks ago, a Taylor\nservice technician realized that he was required to install\nthis new software update on all McDonald's machines. He noticed that the update had a bunch of weird new error codes\nthat made the machine worse and less functional. So he posted a video about it asking for help from\nother service technicians. Shortly after he posted the video, the video disappeared. When asked what happened,\nhe responded with quote, \"The system defeated me.\" He was clearly told to\ntake the video down. Somebody doesn't want this\nsort of thing on the internet. Now listen, this isn't some conspiracy. There's all sorts of weird conspiracies around the ice cream machines, this isn't one of those. This is actually very rational\nhuman and business behavior. When one has a monopoly\nover ice cream makers and they've created a\nparticularly (beep) product that breaks all the time and gives users no clear\nfeedback as to why it's broken, this company has no incentive to improve. In an open market, the incentive to make your product better comes from competition and comes from basically ramifications. You'll be driven out of business if you don't make a good product. In this case, that's not the dynamic. And in fact, having a bad\nproduct is incentivized because it means more money\nin services and repairs for this business. And the reason why McDonald's\ncorporate is okay with that is because the cost isn't born by them. It's born by local franchise\nowners who have to pay for services and repairs. Taylor has the capacity to make and improve ice cream makers. They do that all the time at Wendy's, and Chick-fil-A, and In-N-Out. And yet the machine made for\ntheir OG exclusive partner, McDonald's, doesn't receive\nthe same improvement and refinement. Instead it receives a bunch of new error codes and\nterrible user experience, which always leads to \"Call the guy.\" One franchise owner I talked to said, \"All roads lead to, call the technician.\" Like this product is designed to get you to call the technician. At this moment, as I'm talking to you, 15% of all ice cream machines\nin the US are down. The standard for most industrial products is that you have less\nthan a 1% failure rate for your product. In fact, the real target for mass industrial products is 99.99966% of the time your product is working. That means 3.14 errors for\nevery 1 million opportunities. What you're seeing here with\n15% is a dismal failure. And this is the product of no pressure or no incentive to improve. And in fact, a perverse\nincentive to keep it (beep) The last chapter of this story is the one that is still developing today. And it has to do with the email I got a few months ago from somebody who's deep in the middle of this. I'm gonna lay out some facts here. I'm gonna let the news play out\nover coming weeks and months to see how this happens, but here's what's going on. The guy who reached out to me originally was someone named Jeremy,\nwho is a tech entrepreneur. He invented a product that\ncould basically fix this problem of like terrible feedback to the user of these ice cream machines. It's this device that you plug into your ice cream maker and it connects with your phone and it\ngives you solid reporting on all the things happening\nin your ice cream machine. Something that this does not do. And it identifies like actionable things that you can do, to train your employees to make sure that the\nproblem doesn't happen again. Basically, it avoids this\nhappening in the first place and avoid you needing to\n'call the guy' all the time. As soon as Jeremy launched this product it was a smashing hit\nwith franchise owners. They started selling hundreds of these things to franchises\nall across the country. - [Reporter] People Magazine, reports the chain has\npartnered with Kytch, a company that created\ntechnology to help employees manage the machines and reduce downtime. - The franchise owners I talked to said that instead of getting\nthese vague error codes, now they actually get like solid reporting on what is happening inside this machine, and they can like train their\nemployees to help avoid this. Now lemme just caveat for a second. Jeremy and his company Kytch, obviously have a big\nfinancial stake in this story. I'm aware that he reached\nout to me and gave me some of his data and that\nthere's a big conflict of interest in terms of\nlike neutral journalism and my informant being somebody who stands to gain a lot of money, if this story comes to life. And that's why this story\nhas taken me literally months to report. I've had to go through\nand independently report and verify every single thing\nthat Jeremy has told me. Hence this. (groaning sounds) So, yes, while there is a major\nstake for Jeremy and Kytch for this story and for\nexactly what I'm saying here, the fact is everything that I've said here checks out on my own\nindependent reporting. Just let that be known. Okay. So Kytch got so popular\namong franchise owners that at this conference where\nall the franchise owners got together late last\nyear to have a conference to talk about McDonald's things, sounds like a riveting conference, the head of this organization of franchise owners gets up and says, - Now this is no silver\nbullet, but it's my belief that the information it\nprovides increases awareness and results in faster reaction times when a problem does occur. Now, to be clear, this is not a McDonald's\napproved piece of equipment. - I mean, he sort of like endorsed it. He was like, \"This is a sweet product. It's actually helping us out.\" Soon after this endorsement,\nMcDonald's sends an email to all of its franchises that\nsays that they've determined that Kytch is actually super dangerous. It may cause serious safety\nrisks, and they recommend that the franchise owners stop using it, saying that they will void\ntheir warranty if they do. Wait, what? So you have this device that is clearly solving a major problem, and instead of being like, \"Whoa, tell us more about this. Let's see if we can get this like approved and put it into more shops,\" they blacklist it. And they scare away a\nbunch of their franchisees from using it. I reached out to McDonald's directly\nto ask them point blank, \"Like WTF? Why are you blacklisting\na product that has the potential to solve this problem that you get made fun of all\nthe time on the internet for?\" They came back to me with\nsome boiler plate PR language about being committed to their\ncustomers and all this stuff, being able to buy sweet\ntreats and all this. And then this little nugget\nat the end where they say that McDonald's is testing\na connectivity solution with an approved McDonald's supplier. In other words, McDonald's is working on a product that does\nexactly the same thing. Oh, and the company that they're using to do this is called\nPowerhouse Dynamics, who is, wait for it, owned by the\nsame company that owns Taylor. They're under the same parent company, Taylor and Powerhouse Dynamics. They're keeping it in the family. Oh, and this device, the new\none that they're testing out, doesn't give the full picture to the user. It continues to block them\nout of certain aspects of the machine that could be useful in diagnosing why the\nmachine is always broken. The theme here is the same. It has been the whole time. Two old companies that\nhave been working together for a long time, looking out for each other\nand keeping control over data so that they can save their own necks from being disrupted by new tech. That is like a story, like\nthat is as old as time, and it is happening right here in a potentially collusionary way. Again, is this a deep conspiracy? Is there like secret\nbackdoor deals going on? No, this is actually horribly predictable. What this is, is old\ncompanies who are afraid of being disrupted by\nsmarter, better products, doing whatever they can to hold on to their share of the market. This new connectivity product\nthat McDonald's mentioned to me, basically does\nthe same thing as Kytch. But this new device doesn't\nactually give the full picture. It still blocks the user out\nof those things that have been behind the technician's secret menu. The things that the user manual\nitself says are critical. It's the same old story\nof keeping tight control over what data and\nexperience the user has, so that they can continue to maintain their exclusive relationship with services and repairs,\nwhich is 25% of their business. It's honestly smart, shrewd,\ncutthroat, business behavior. But you know who it hurts? It hurts the franchisees and it hurts all of us who\nwanna go buy McFlurries. This is anti-competitive behavior. Trying to squash new products in the name of retaining control. So, there's a lot of nuance here that I've sort of blasted\nthrough very quickly, but the upshot is that\nMcDonald's ice cream makers are broken more than everyone\nelse's ice cream makers, even though they're made\nby the same company, because the company that makes them has no incentive to improve, and in fact has an\nincentive to keep them bad. Over the years, they've done a terrible job\nimproving their software, and they've kept employees,\nmanagers, and franchisees in the dark of what's actually going on with their ice cream maker, preventing them from actually being able to fix it themselves. And when finally someone comes with a product that could actually fix it, they squash it in the\nname of their own product that does sort of a worse version of what that new product was going to do. Kytch is suing McDonald's\nfor a bunch of stuff. Go read into the lawsuit if you'd like. And certainly in coming months,\nwe will learn the details of exactly how this is all going down. But for now next time you're at McDonald's and they\ndon't have ice cream, just know that it's not\nbecause of lazy employees, it's not because of lack of training, it's because there's an old relationship between two old companies that\ndon't want things to change."

    "title": "Why the Suez Canal is so Insanely Important.. (and Nukes)",
    "video_id": "9PbgYReEUO8",
    "captions": "(loud explosions) - The big ship is not stuck\nanymore, which is kinda cool. There was this big cargo ship\nis like a quarter mile long and it was stuck in the Suez Canal, created this huge traffic jam. - [News Reporter] Blocking\none of the world's most important shipping lines. - They spent days trying to dig it out. It was costing like $400 million an hour for the global economy,\nand now it's not stuck. But I can't stop thinking\nabout it because this ship and it being stuck for a few days reminds us just what the global economy is and how important one\nlittle strip of water can be both for the economy, but also for countries who want power. So, I'm gonna tell you an\ninsane story about this canal. It was the 1960s and the US government was thinking about using 520 nuclear bombs to make a new canal for themselves right here next to the Suez Canal. We're talking over a hundred\nkilometers of a new canal to connect the Mediterranean to the Red Sea using nuclear bombs. Wait, what? Oh my gosh, it's so insane. Like it's so insane. This was gonna cost like $5\nbillion in today's terms. And the idea here was to create a strategically valuable alternate to the present day Suez Canal. To understand why the US would even consider blowing up 520 nukes in the Israeli desert. You have to understand\nthis little strip of water and why it has been so vital to so many powerful\ncountries over the years. First, let's look at a map. This is an amazing\nproject from shipmap.org, where each dot represents a cargo ship, similar size to the Empire State Building. Each of these ships is carrying around 1,000 containers. It's like 25,000 tons of stuff. (upbeat music) These ships fuel our lifestyles. A good example is iPhone if you have one. Before you ever see your iPhone, there's an amazing\njourney that it goes on. Every individual part of your iPhone has its own little story. They're sourced from\n43 different countries on all six continents. There's no way I could go\ninto every single component, but let's just take one\nthing, the processor, the sort of brain of your iPhone. The processor starts as raw\nmaterials, tons of raw materials like boron from Turkey\nor copper from Chile or tantalum from Rwanda and way, way more that are mined in different countries and shipped to a factory in\nTaiwan where it is manufactured and then shipped to the Philippines to be tested and packaged before\nit is then shipped to China to be integrated into your phone. And that is just for the little\nprocessor in your iPhone, not to mention the screen and\nthe casing and the camera. Each one of these has components that are sourced from all around world. They go through this complex journey to then be assembled and then get put back\nonto a shipping container to be shipped to your\ncountry where you can buy it. No matter how I put it, saying it's a complex global supply chain, there's no way we can even fathom just how big and massive\nthese operations are. The amount of space of ocean that these products pass through to eventually make it into our hands. And this is everything, my clothing, my computer,\nmy camera equipment, everything around me\npasses through this system. To add another layer of weird complexity, the ships themselves\nlike the physical ships are also mind bendingly complex. So let's take the ever given, this ship that was stuck\nin the Suez Canal recently. This ship is chartered\nby a Taiwanese company. But it is registered in Panama. I've talked about ship registration in a different video by the way, and why ships wanna be registered\nin different countries. Anyway, it is registered in Panama charted by a Taiwanese company, but the ship itself, the physical ship is owned by a Japanese company which is owned by a bigger\nconglomerate of ship builders. Oh, and the technical manager on board is actually a German guy, and the crew are a punch\nof Indian nationals. I mean, this ship itself is just a symbol of how big and convoluted and multilayered this huge global system is. Okay, so that's the global economy. Let's get back to the Suez Canal. Take a look at this canal\nfor like five seconds and you realize that it's not natural, way to straight of lines. But back before it was built, if you wanted to get from Europe to Asia, you had to sort of do this. (upbeat music) Back then the British controlled this little port in South Africa which gave them a very\nnice strategic advantage because everyone who was doing world trade or domination had to pass through them. The British were loving this monopoly over the trade route\nuntil like the mid 1800s when the French went to the Egyptians and they said, \"Hey, is there any way we\ncould like dig out a canal right here on this land bridge that connects Africa with Asia? It's almost 200 kilometers long, but if we could just dig out a canal here, we would save thousands of\nkilometers on each trip to Asia.\" Reminder, this is like the 1860s and like, they don't have loads of fancy equipment to do\nthis, but they try it anyway. With over 100,000 people, many of them forced the laborers working on this canal for over 10 years, they were able to dig this big canal that connected the Mediterranean\nSea to the Red Sea. The British were down here still like, \"Wait, why is no one coming\nthrough our Cape anymore?\" And the French were up here, just laughing, feeling so\ngood about their new canal. (laughing) So over the years, quickly this becomes the epicenter of water\ncontrol and balance of power. Control over the canal is\nmainly French and Egyptian for most of its time. But eventually the British, they couldn't help themselves, they needed in on this waterway. Fast forward a few years and all of the big powers get together and say like, \"Whoa, whoa,\nwhoa we built this canal with a spirit of\ncooperation and neutrality. All countries should be\nable to use this canal even in times of war,\neverything will be peaceful and wonderful and this will be one.\" No, no, no, no, no. They signed this treaty\nabout like neutrality and everyone can use it, but\nlet's just say it right now, that's not the way the world works. Soon, the globe descended into World War and it became clear that this canal would not be neutral anytime soon. Hitler wanted it, so him\nand his Italian allies went down to try to take it\nover, British fought back and they were able to keep it and there were British troops there. So the canal remained in British control until like the 1950s. When finally Egypt was like, \"Okay listen, France,\nBritain, this has been fun. This whole pretend that this is neutral, but it's not actually neutral and you're actually just using it for whatever you want thing. You're done, it is our\ncanal, get out of here.\" And he's like, \"Oh, and\nIsrael you can't come here and use our waterway either. That's part of this.\" So France and Britain\naren't feeling super great. They just got kicked out of like their key strategic waterway. They decide to say no and they send in a bunch of\nparatroopers to the Suez Canal, along with Israel's fighters to recapture the canal from Egypt and to overthrow the government\nthat just kicked them out. (upbeat music) And the US has seen all of this and they're like, \"Guys,\nit's not 1850 anymore. Times have changed. You can't just show up wherever you want and just take it over militarily. We don't do that anymore. That's so like old school empire.\" But the US says, \"You\ncan still be an empire in these times, you just have to be a\nlittle smoother about it.\" \u266a Go baby go \u266a - So, US sends in this Canadian guy to settle the conflict over the canal. And everyone's sort of like, \"Okay, fine.\" And the canal goes back to peace with like some UN peacekeepers\nto keep it at peace kind of. Well, no, this isn't going to last. So this is where the US gets it creative and it's like, \"Ooh, what can we do to not have to fight over the canal, but like do our own thing.\" And that's when the nuclear bombs come up. Where they're like, \"If we just plant 520 nuclear bombs here in the Israeli desert, we could just have our own canal and then we don't have\nto fight over this one.\" (blasting sound) So, it's 1967 and Israel's like, \"I'm not super into the idea\nof you like nuking our desert, but we like nuclear weapons and we'll totally get on board with that.\" In the meantime, can we go\nin and attack Egypt ourselves and get the canal and you can just sort of\nback us from the sidelines. And the US is like, \"Okay, fine.\" (upbeat music) So Israel goes in and\ntakes over all of this land all the way up to the Suez Canal. So it's Egypt on one\nside Israel on the other. And for the next few years, this becomes a literal battle\nground for multiple wars. Like they were building\nbridges across the canal to like bring in tanks and fight. And of course, during\nthese years of fighting from like the late 60s to the mid 70s, the canal was closed for obvious reasons. The problem is when they closed it, there were 15 ships that were like in process of moving through and those ships just got stuck there for literally eight years. So yeah, ever given, we know\nthat it was a hard few days who the world was super worried about you, $400 million a day. Imagine being one of\nthese guys, eight years. At least they had fun\nduring their time, I guess. Do you see where I'm going with this? What I'm trying to do here is not give you a history\nlesson of the Suez Canal. I'm trying to explain\nthat this stretch of water has always been a magnet\nfor international conflict. ever since it's very, very conception. After that last war, the US is like, okay, broker our peace, they broke our piece. And then they bring in these\nhelicopters to the Suez Canal with like a water sled behind them and they drag them along the water because there was a bunch of like live explosives from the waters. And they were trying to like rid them all so that they could presume\nlike normal shipping lanes. They eventually did that. They got rid of all the explosives and reopened the canal in 1975. And the canal remained peaceful and under the control\nof its rightful owner, the Egyptians, forevermore,\nand there was no more conflict or geopolitical scheming again. No, that isn't the way the world works. Yes, things have changed\nin the way that we do it. But the fact is, when you\nhave a system like this and a large portion of that system which is money and control\nand economics and energy runs through a choke point in that system, there will always be geostrategic value that is put on that system. Not just for economics, but for power. So do you think that the United States who's sort of the big boy\nworld policeman right now would sit here and let\nEgypt control the choke hold where 12% of the world\neconomy passes through including loads of oil. No, that's not how it works. Despite the fact that Egypt\nis a nondemocratic regime, but it's pretty terrible on all fronts including human rights. The US still provides $1.4\nbillion of military aid to Egypt every year. They are always considered a\nkey ally in the middle East. The Clinton administration\nmade it very clear that the reason we support Egypt is because they have the Suez Canal and we need them to owe favors. That continues today. Whenever a US military vessel\nshows up to the Suez Canal, they get to cut in line and go through quicker\nthan everybody else. So, yeah, Egypt owns the canal, but really it's the us behind the scenes that is keeping everything in order. The canal is not neutral. It will never be neutral. There will always be geopolitical\nimportance placed on it. And as long as there's a superpower, that power will control the canal. (upbeat music) The last thing I'll say\nis that we live in a world that is very strange\nfor how peaceful it is. We've had an enduring peace\nfor many, many decades. That piece allows us to\nhave a system like this. And that piece exists partly because we are so entangled with\none another economically that it doesn't make sense to go to war, but we have to remember\nthat that piece also exists because all the big powers\nhave really big weapons that are always pointed at each other. If something slips or\nescalates a little too far, just to remember that the Suez Canal isn't the only choke point on earth where all of this system flows through and that while we take\npeace for granted now, it would be naive not\nto wonder what happens if that were to go away and we were faced with not just one ship\nbeing stuck for a few days, but an entire region militarized and unavailable for this\ntype of shipping flow that we're so used to. And for years, I don't\nwanna sound alarmist, but I do want us to be thinking about our reliance on the system and what it means for the\nfuture of rising powers that may not want to cooperate\nas well as they do today. So when I see ever given blown\noff course for a few days and everyone freaking out about it, I don't just see one ship I see a vulnerable system and I see myself and how deeply connected I am to that system. (upbeat music) So, I'm listening to an audio book right\nnow called \"Silence\". Shusaku Endo is the author, and it's about like a\nCatholic missionary in Japan, like in maybe the 15 or 1600s, maybe the 1700s, I don't\nknow, a long time ago. I'm listening to it on Audible which is the sponsor of today's video, which I can't really believe I'm saying because I've been subscribed to Audible since like 2011 or 2012, like\nright when they first came out and it has changed my entire world. So the fact that they're\nsponsoring this video and supporting my channel is\na very exciting thing for me and I still kind of giddy about it. Anyway, Audible is a giant\nrepository of audio books and podcasts and all\nsorts of audio resources that have changed my life. I am always listening\nto several audio books on Audible at any given time. Sometimes it is historical fiction, sometimes it is like fantasy stuff. Oftentimes I will be\nlistening to an audio book about some video I'm working on like Russia or American expansion. There is so much to learn on this app. So you can do a month of\nAudible for free if you want. There's a link in my description, it is Audible.com/JohnnyHarris. You can also text Johnny\nHarris to the number 500-500. Clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gets you a\nmonth of free Audible. What I love about an Audible membership is that you get an audio book every month. You can choose whatever\naudio book you want no matter how expensive it is, you get it for the one flat\nfee that you pay per month. And then you get unlimited access to all of these original titles, like the original content\nthat they produce. There's tons of stuff. I use this stuff for like my kids too, and I get it for free because\nI'm an Audible member. It's a very good deal. So, link in my description,\nAudible.com/JohnnyHarris, or text my name to this number and you can get it on this deal. I just love Audible\nbecause I love learning and it allows me to learn a lot more because I'm not very good at reading 'cause I'm dyslexic and\nthat's a whole nother story. Thank you all for being here. I will see in the next one. (upbeat music)"

    "title": "Skid Row, Explained",
    "video_id": "rKo8Sv99MkM",
    "captions": "- [Announcer] Documentary\nfor the Cecil Hotel. - [Man] Is there something\nevil going on here? - There's a neighborhood in Los Angeles that we need to talk about, it's called Skid Row. Last month, there was this really popular true crime documentary on Netflix. It was like the number\none most watched show here in the United States\nand maybe around the world. And it was about this hotel that was right here in Skid Row, it's about a 21 year old Canadian woman who disappeared after exhibiting some very strange behavior in an elevator. And yes, there's gonna be\nplenty of spoilers here. - [Woman] The Hotel Cecil is content and it's got some sort of uncanny force. - The show is haunting, and confusing, and thrilling, and an\nappalling and insensitive abuse of the power of documentary filmmaking. The whole series feels like\na true crime documentary but there ends up being no crime at all. And the whole energy of this series is founded on the idea that this hotel is haunted with dark energy. - [Man] I think that\nwe're hoping for a ghost because it's what we've come to expect. - I'm here to tell you\nthat the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles doesn't have dark energy, that's a tantalizing, but\nvery lazy explanation. And it exonerates the people and policies that built modern day LA. Instead, there's a much bigger story here. One that the documentary decides to largely ignore or mischaracterize. The story worth telling\nhere about this hotel and the neighborhood in which it resides is the story of how\ncities draw boundaries. These subtle borders that are meant to contain the city's least wanted people. Once you understand what this looks like and how it happened in LA, you can understand how it\nhappens in a lot of cities and it helps you understand what's really going on\nwith the Cecil Hotel. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] It's the story of a city in the microcosm of the \"American Dream.\" - Okay, first, let's establish what and where the Cecil Hotel is in LA. Here's Downtown LA, and you have this Financial District here with all these big buildings. A few streets over it,\nyou have the Cecil Hotel, right on the border of this 50 city block neighborhood\ncalled Skid Row, right in the heart of Downtown LA. Go to Skid Row today and you are quickly brought into the plight of basic survival for nearly 5,000 homeless people. - The reason why I come to\nso many tents out of here is because people can't\nafford to live in a house. - Nearly half of them\nare considered to have serious mental illness and life expectancy here is 48 years old, 30 years less than the US average. This small block of streets is surrounded by highly developed districts that every year become more\nshiny and more expensive. So how did Skid Row, this one small block of Downtown become where so many of the city's sick and marginalized gathered? (upbeat music) Way back when California was first taken from Mexico to become part of the United States, loads of Americans were moving West, moving to California. Some of them were looking for gold and some were just\nlooking for a new start. The US used to be really\ngood at railroads, and they built a railroad\nacross the entire country. That railroad ended right here in LA, right in the location\nof modern day Skid Row. - [Reporter] There is\nprobably no single area holding so much of charm and beauty and the good things of life\nas Southern California. - [Johnny] We see a lot of people arriving around this train\nstation, looking for work. This area developed a reputation as being full of transient people\ncoming to the West with dreams of gold and a new start, and instead ending up with\nneither, no jobs, no homes. It was a part of town\nthat no one wanted to go. - [Reporter] Los Angeles County has a gregarious fun zone where everybody has a good time. - As LA grew, so did the\nbad reputation of Skid Row and so did the homeless population. The neighborhood was sort\nof for the untouchables and when anyone considered helping them or figuring out a policy to\nsolve this, people resisted. One columnist of the day wrote, quote, don't help this class, it is a crime against\nthe community to do so. The Cecil Hotel was eventually\nconstructed in the 1920s right here on the outskirts of what was becoming this\nundesirable part of town. At the time, it was a Grand Hotel built for business travelers. What turned the Cecil\nHotel from this to this wasn't dark energy or mysterious forces, nor was it the fact that YouTube played a concert on the roof right next to the Cecil\nHotel in the late '80s. (rock music playing) No, no, no, no, no, no. What happened to the Cecil Hotel is something that happened to this whole neighborhood,\nstarting in the 1970s. When city planners and politicians started reinvisioning Downtown LA, drawing lines on maps to contain the growing population of\nmentally ill and homeless. The goal here was to bulldoze all the decaying buildings in Downtown and to make way for a\nnew business district, full of tall shiny buildings. The original demolition\nplan included Skid Row, but the community leaders fought back saying, listen city of LA, if you demolish Skid Row without solving the underlying issues, you're just gonna have a\nbunch of smaller Skid Rows pop up scattered throughout the city. Homelessness isn't gonna go away if you just bulldoze the neighborhood, the city was like, yeah, you have a point. So they agreed upon setting firm borders, that would be the quote, containment zone where the homeless and mentally ill could stay so that the\nsurrounding neighborhoods could build nice big office buildings without the presence of these\nundesirable populations. Within Skid Row, they\nconstructed public bathrooms and benches and public spaces so that as the city officials said, those amenities could quote, act as a magnet to hold the undesirable population\nelements in Skid Row. Undesirable population elements, wow, that is just a fantastic way to take human beings and\nturn them into units. (bells chiming) So weird. Even though the borders of Skid Row based on the city plan\nwere not like walls, they were just city streets but the city planners made sure that they would have quote, 'strong edges' that will act as a buffer between Skid Row and the\nrest of the central city. They promised that when Skid Row residents enter the buffer, the\npsychological comfort of the familiar Skid Row\nenvironment will be lost. So how did they do this? One way they did this\nis with harsh lighting. Back in the old days, they had these historic\nlights on main street which is one of the borders of Skid Row. They replaced those with\nlike harsh prison lights to make it very, just unpleasant\nto walk across the street. They put locks on the trash cans in the surrounding districts so people wouldn't leave Skid Row to come scavenge for food. Residents of Skid Row also reported that police officers would be\npatrolling these borders and anytime someone would cross they would be approached, yet, they would be left alone for a time if they stayed peaceful\nwithin the containment zone. All of this happened throughout the '70s, '80s and '90s as rent prices started to go up all throughout this area. So rent is getting more expensive, at the same time, funding for\nmental health institutions was drying up and the war on drugs propagated by the Reagan\nAdministration was also heating up. Skid Row literally\nbecame a dumping grounds for mental health institutions who would drop off patients right here knowing that they would be contained. The idea of saving Skid Row by drawing borders around it came from the community\nleaders of Skid Row itself. It was a solution to\nkeep affordable housing, keep the community intact, but soon this solution\nwas used as an excuse to neglect the people within these lines. Street cleaners and trash collectors came less frequently\nthan in the rest of LA. City maintenance for streets sort of stopped showing up, but the one city resource that did show up in\nabundance was the police, whose job it was to keep these quote, undesirable population\nelements within this zone, criminalizing the poverty\ninside these lines, and yes, here's the Cecil Hotel right within these firm\ncontainment borders. So if you look at the Cecil\nHotel under this lens, you now see the danger,\nthe drugs, the violence, not being caused by\nsome creepy dark energy that lured in this woman from Canada. Instead, this was the result of a policy intentionally creating\nborders within the city to keep the city's problems\ncontained into one area. A spot that had real culture and community values and history, and yet because of these\ndehumanizing policies, Skid Row became defined as a series of statistics\nand social problems. What I've found by looking\ninto these policies is that this wasn't an\ninevitable course of action, the city could've put its money and effort behind the harder thing to do, which is addressing the underlying issues of unemployment, mental\nillness, drug addiction, and unaffordable housing stock. And yet the policy they pursued was fixing this problem with a band-aid, using policing and the\npower of redevelopment. The real problems were swept under the rug to be dealt with another day, keeping the city's problems contained neatly in this border and\nhiding them from view. (bright upbeat music) So let me tell you about\nthe sponsor of today's video which is a thing that has led me watch a bunch more stuff on Netflix that I wouldn't be able\nto watch otherwise, Express VPN is a very affordable way to not only protect your anonymity while you are on the Internet, but also allows you to expand\nyour entertainment options. Basically what a VPN is, is it allows you to\nconnect to the Internet but like via a different country. So like I'm in the US, but I can like connect via Canada, or the UK, or India, and now the Internet thinks\nthat I'm in those countries. But also, it allows you to expand the stuff you're watching, like a show like Brooklyn\nNine-Nine, for example. Like I can watch stuff that's\nonly available in Canada here in the United States\nwhich is pretty cool. The crazy thing about this though is that it's really cheap. Like it's very affordable and you can actually get\nthree months of this for free, so you can test it out and check it out. I've been using Express\nVPN since probably 2016 and I find it to be a very\nuseful and easy service. One thing I use Express VPN for a lot is when I travel and I'm\nin a different country and I don't want the Internet to think that I'm in that country because then it blocks me out of my Gmail account and all of that. I haven't been traveling for a while but I'm gonna be starting soon, I just got vaccinated. So Express VPN is a fantastic way to keep my internet connection here in the United States\nwhile I'm traveling. There's a link in my description, when you click that link, it helps support this channel but also click that link to find out how you can get three months for free, zero money of Express VPN so you can start getting in\non some of these benefits. Thank you Express VPN for\nsponsoring this channel, thank you all for watching, lots more to come. I have been all over the place when it comes to topics. I feel like it's been Russia, not in Russia, I'm fascinated\nwith Russia lately. It's been Janet Jackson, it's been the US Military, Skid Row, I just, I'm all over the place. I've got a really big story coming out early next month that I'm excited to share with you. So stay tuned, subscribe to my channel if you are not subscribed, and I'll talk to you later, bye-bye."

    "title": "Why is Russia So DAMN BIG?",
    "video_id": "HBlZlmXyR5M",
    "captions": "- This video was sponsored by Skillshare, which is a place where you\ncan learn basically anything you want for less than $10 a month. Anyway, let's get to it. (papers rustle) Russia here we go. It's like this page and\nthis page, this is Russia. It's huge. It doesn't even fit on one of these pages. I ripped the page. Let's look at Russia (upbeat music) (guns bangs) But wait. Yes this is Russia, but\nRussia is also this and this and this, this one country encompasses\nover a 100 languages spread across 11 times zones. I mean the place is freaking huge. Countries aren't really\nsupposed to be this big. So how did this happen? How did Russia become so damn big. Countries come in all shapes and sizes. You have really small\ncountries like here in Europe the country of Monaco is tiny. It's literally two square kilometers like smaller than most cities. Now that's obviously an outlier. So let's look at a more average\nsize country like Belgium. More like 11,000 square kilometers. Then you have even bigger\ncountries like France that like 550,000 square kilometers. Over here in the United States, where everything is apparently bigger. You have States that\nare bigger than France. Like the state of Texas is\n695,000 square kilometers. All 48 of these continental\nUnited States are huge by European standards at least. This whole continental United States is 8 million square kilometers. So you have all these\ndifferent sizes of countries. The average sort of looks like this and then you have the second\nlargest country on earth which is Canada huge. But now take a look at the size of the largest country on earth. Russia is huge. It is more than double the size of the continental United States. 17 million square kilometers. Makes up one eighth of the\ntotal habitable area on earth. And it's almost double\nthe next biggest country on this list, I mean it's mindblowing. Russia is a part of Europe. It also shares a beach line with Turkey but then you go all the way over here and it has an extensive border\nwith China and North Korea. Keep going and it stretches\nall the way up here to where you could literally swim from Russia to the United\nStates assuming you can swim, like two and a half miles. So yeah, Russia is (beep)\ngetting huge, it's giant. But not that long ago Russia wasn't huge. In fact, relative to\nempires and their borders Russia was kind of a small fish. That's the story I wanna tell you. (upbeat music) A thousand years ago\nRussia looked like this, a loose group of Slavic peoples who were a growing and prosperous\nsociety here in Eastern Europe but they had a pretty big weakness. And that weakness looked like this. These are flat grasslands,\nwhich are very easy to cross if you're an army looking to pillage land. And that's exactly what a group of horse-riding warriors did. These guys were the Mongols and\nthey basically use this path of flat grasslands to traverse across Asia\nand expand their empire. 40,000 of these Mongo guys on\nhorses with bows and arrows eventually made it all the way here to the Slavic peoples of Russia. Here's an image of them\ninvading the cities and burning them down\nconquering these people. Look how scared these people look. I mean, I would be too if\n40,000 Mongols on horseback rode into my city. (speaks foreign language) (men chant) Anyway so the Mongols takeover, this little block of Slavic people and it really weakens their society. It breaks up all the cities\nthat were sort of collaborating with each other. And now they're paying\ntaxes to the Mongols like this empire that\nwas from super far away, like on the other side of the world. But there was one city\nin this area that was particularly ready to fight back. They were quietly getting more powerful. This city was called Muscovy\nor Moscow eventually. And it became the regional\nepicenter for trading fur which is a thing that\nwas becoming all the rage in Europe. Moscow was also learning\nhow to use gunpowder and guns and technology\nfrom Europe and before long, they were able to punch\nback against the Mongols whose big empire was getting really big and hard to maintain. And it sort of starting to\ncrack and Moscow was there to take advantage of this. I mean, let's be honest. There's only so long\nyou can keep an empire that looks like this together way too big. I mean, this is the biggest\nland empire in history, but it didn't last long, even though they had these bad-ass warriors on a horseback anyway. So yeah, Moscow started punching back. They had fur money and they had gunpowder and they were having success\npushing the Mongols out and moving east. One thing's for sure said Moscow which was soon becoming\nthe Russian empire. \"We're not gonna to let\nanyone sneak up on us again \"like the Mongols did.\" And everyone over here sort of chuckled in European and said don't you realize that the only way to keep people out is to have like mountains\nand water to protect you. And the Russians were like, oh yeah you mean like these and the Europeans were like, nice. So Moscow, which was just a city but now becoming the Russian\nempire starts expanding towards these mountains and soon they have like a nice\nempire sized set of borders. Some mountains for protection\nhave an economy of fur they have technology and commerce. They're getting rich things\nwere looking good for Russia but wait a minute, can we\noverlay that green layer on the map that shows the\nsuper highway of grasslands that the Mongols use to invade? Yeah that one, that one. (indistinct) look, there's\na flaw in the plan. Nice try Russia. But you see that this natural border, which is great has a huge gap of flat grasslands that\npeople can easily pass directly on their way to Moscow. So it's the middle of the 15 hundreds. Moscow has beat back the\nMongols, is expanding east. They're doing their fur thing. They find kind of a natural border, but it doesn't really work. So they're still looking for\na natural border or water or something to buffer\ntheir country to the east. And then this terrible\nguy comes into power. His name was literally Ivan the terrible. And he had some pretty big\nambitions for expanding Russia. He's like dude, we don't need\nto stop at these mountains. Let's see how far we\ncan push this thing east way past the mountains. What he finds on the other\nside of these mountains is a very sparsely populated\nland of ice called Siberia. There wasn't a lot of people here and the people that were\nthere weren't super resistant to this Russian takeover. The main thing that the\nRussians had to fight against was the cold. But with cold comes furry animals who have thick coats of fur which again was incredibly\nvaluable in European markets. And that helped fuel this race to just keep going east. (upbeat music) Is it just me or are they\nsort of overcompensating? Like yeah, we get it You\ngot invaded by the Mongols. And like, you wanna like make\nsure it doesn't happen again, but like settled down\nthey just kept moving east till eventually they\nreached the Pacific ocean the edge of the world. But they didn't stop there\nthey just kept going. I mean, listen, this is so far away from the original\nstarting point of Moscow. And it started to get to the point where the government back in Moscow was sort of sending out expeditions not really sure what they were doing and what they were taking over because they couldn't really\nlike stay in touch with them. They were just sort of hoping for the best after one Russian dude\nwent out on an expedition and conquered some remote\ncity in the far east the government official\nback in Moscow said, nobody really knows why he\ndid that and to what end. There is, however, something erotic taking place in the borders of our empire Erotic I guess that's\none way to talk about it. But here's the most interesting part to me about this Russian imperialism\nthat is very different than most imperialism\nthat I've looked into. When the Russians would find a tribe or a people or a culture that\nwas very different than theirs because they were so far from home. They first tried to negotiate with them and convince them to\njoin the Russian empire. If people resisted it got very predictable\nimperialism very quickly but a lot of tribes didn't resist and they found it beneficial to be a part of this growing empire. So this empire grew\nwithout a lot of conflict and in the process in\ndeveloping a lot of cultures that sort of kept their\nidentity their language, their culture far, far away from Moscow because of this Russia today\nis yes, this huge land mass but perhaps a better way\nto look at it is this. (upbeat music) Russia today is divided\ninto 85 territories. 22 of these territories are\nactually called republics have their own official\nlanguage, their own legislature and basically are totally\nindependent from Russia except for in international affairs. It's like 22 countries within a country all with their own unique style. So yeah, well Russia is this. There's also other versions of Russia. And I wanna show you some of those. Stop one let's look at\nthe Republic of Sakha. It's located way in\nthe east and it's huge. 3.1 million square kilometers massive. This place is in a time zone\nsix hours ahead of Moscow. The people here don't\nlook like Putin at all. Their ancestors are not from\nthe original Moscow Russia area and they speak their own\nNorthern Siberian Turkic language as well. The capital of this Russian\nRepublic is way up here. It's called Yakutsk. It's the coldest large city on earth with an average temperature of minus eight degrees centigrade. And this whole region is\nfull of these giant holes. In these holes they're\nlooking for diamonds, 25% of the world's diamonds\nare mined in this Republic. So yeah, this is Russia. Next stop down here is Dagestan which borders the countries\nof Azerbaijan and Georgia. The climate here is so\ndifferent than what I think of when I think of Russia, it is hot and dry and people here speak 13\ndifferent official languages besides Russian plus there's a bunch of\nunofficial languages. And 83% of the people\nhere identify as Muslim, which again like I don't\nthink of Muslims in Russia, but this is Russia. It's right next to Chechnya which is another part of Russia, which is politically and culturally very much doing its own thing. The people here declared\nindependence in the nineties which caused rebel groups to\nmilitarize and there was war and terrorist attacks and people died and Putin may or may not\nhave planned a bombing to frame Chechnyan terrorists\nto then go to war with them so he could get approval ratings. So he could take over the country. Becoming (indistinct). No, no, wait, no I'm not going down the\nfreaking rabbit hole. I'm doing one of those\nfun geography videos where we talk about cultural\ndiversity and like borders and history and not this stuff come on. Just is once can I just go into a video\nwithout having to talk about the fact that some people\nare really terrible? (sighs) Anyway so Dagestan down here has all these different\nlanguages and people so different than what I think\nabout when I think of Russia. Plus, I mean, look at\nthis fashion culture. Okay so there's a Republic\nhere, right on these mountains, these mountains that we talked about that were sort of a good natural border but had a big hole in\nthem, the Ural mountains this is the Komi Republic. The main thing about this Republic is it doesn't look like the sort of ice swept Moscow streets\nthat I'm used to Russia. This place is known for its natural beauty beautiful landscapes and\nwhere the gulags where@ the brutal Russian prisons\nduring the Soviet times where they would do terrible things. Anyway, there's these\nbeautiful rock formations that are super unique and people aren't supposed to climb on them because there's some\nlegend that it's bad luck, but of course, foreigners\nshow up and do stupid things and they couldn't resist\nand here they are. Anyway, this is Russia. Okay a couple more, you have\nthis Republic of come Kalmykia. You just need to look at this place and its people to know that\nthis feels very different than what you think of as Russia. And yet this is Russia. Mother Russia has been sort\nof brutal to these people over the years trying\nto erase their culture, but even still, they persist. Last one I wanna talk\nabout is called Tuva. It's down here. Here's Putin visiting Tuva a while back. This is another place where\nRussian ethnicity and language is a minority. The people here are more\nrelated to the Mongols and they speak a Turkic\nlanguage called Tuvan which sounds like this. (speaks in foreign language) (soft music) So yeah, the upshot here\nis that this is Russia but so is this and this and this and this. Russia got really big as they\nwere searching for a border and for fur and they just\nkept expanding their empire enveloping all of the people\nand cultures that came with it. Okay let me just be clear about something. Russia is giant this video\nis not 15 hours long. And so I was able to give\na very brief overview of the history. The history is so much more\nmind bendingly complicated. It's like Game of Thrones on steroids not to mention today's Russia\nis also so much more diverse like a mosaic of cultures and languages that I was able to give\na little overview for. But I know that a lot of\nyou watching are thinking why isn't he mentioning,\nfill in the blank. I wanna hear from you. Like, what are the parts of\nRussia that you know about that I didn't mention here\nthat are the most interesting or the most surprising\nthat are more different from the Russia that we sort of think of? Let me know in the comments. I got fascinated with Russia\nas we did the Navalny video a while back and I'm now becoming deeper\nand deeper into this place and where it came from and\nwhat it looks like today. I've never visited and I want\nto, so maybe I can't though because I did that the Navalny video and there'll be angry at\nme if I go there anyway, hadn't thought about that. (soft music) Okay before you go, I want to\ntell you how you can sign up for Skillshare for free\nand start learning stuff. Skillshare is this giant\nrepository of tutorials. Video-based quality tutorials\nthat can teach you anything from photography to business skills to cooking, to animation.

    "title": "How Belgian Imperialism Gave Us The COVID Vaccine",
    "video_id": "IMY4UOA7E_w",
    "captions": "- Check out this map of Africa. Back then, most of this continent had been carved up by European powers. Belgium had a big swath\nof Africa right here, where the modern day Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo is. What Belgium did in the Congo is shocking, and hard to get your head around. It's terrible, in fact. But, Belgium's horrendous\nactions in the Congo would lead to this. - I would definitely take the\nJohnson & Johnson vaccine. - The FDA has just\napproved a third vaccine. - Let's talk about the J&J. - The Johnson & Johnson,\ncoronavirus vaccine. (speaking in foreign language) - Johnson & Johnson's. - Johnson & Johnson's. - Vaccine. - The new Johnson & Johnson\nvaccine is a game changer, for the fight against COVID-19. It is cheaper. It can be shipped without\nhaving to be frozen, so it's way more durable. It's made of really advanced\nsophisticated technology that allows you to just get one shot of it instead of the two doses\nfrom the previous ones. - [Reporter] J&J's version\nrequires just one dose. - That's a big deal when\nyou're trying to vaccinate literally billions of people. And so to understand how this vaccine that is being rolled out\nby Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey based company, how that is connected to Belgium in the late 1800s in the Congo basin. You have to understand the story of how the sophisticated\ntechnology was developed, and by whom. - [Narrator] One man at\nthe conference of Berlin, walked away with his own private colony, and showed what colonialism\nlooked like at its very worst. - [Reporter] This date\nmarked the beginning of white penetration into\nthe black heart of Africa. - [Narrator] African sleeping sickness is caused by the protozoan parasite. - [Announcer] Johnson &\nJohnson the most trusted name in surgical dressings. \u266a In the language of love \u266a - Let me tell you a story\nof one of the most insane and horrendous versions of\nEuropean colonialism in Africa. [Female Narrator] The 1880s and 90s, were years of terrifying\nupheaval in Africa. - It starts with this\nguy, King Leopold II, he was the King of Belgium. And by the way, this\nwasn't like 300 years ago. This is like the mid to late 1800s. Belgium, wasn't a big player\nin the colonizing game, not like France and Britain, but Leopold sort of wanted to be. He wanted to be a big\nboy in peerless nation. So he actually went to Spain and Portugal whose empires were sort\nof declining at the time, and offered to buy some of\ntheir colonial possessions. They didn't agree. So, Leopold decided to take\nthings into his own hands. Like literally on his own. He himself, privately, would\ncreate a colony for Belgium. Okay. So quick pause. I just got an email from Morning Brew. Which is a thing that gets\nsent to my inbox every morning, and is a digest of all of\nthe news that is happening. But it's not just like\nthe sad, depressing news. It's like actually interesting stuff. I don't like going down\nthe rabbit hole of trying to find out what news I should be reading. So much of it is like noise\nand it doesn't help me understand the world. Morning Brew just gives me a digest, like a spark notes version. Oh, it's literally free. Like there's no money involved here. Like, all you do is sign up, and it takes 15 seconds to sign up. And then you get this in your inbox. I feel like my mornings before this were a little bit more scattered of like what should I be reading this morning? I'm not going to listen to\nlike a 20 minute podcast. What can I sort of breeze through? Morning Brew just aggregates\nit all into one place. Morning Brew sponsored this video. They don't have any signup deal or discount because it's literally free. Like it pays zero money. You just go sign up. The link is in my description. When you click that link, it\nhelps support this channel, but it also gets you signed up for this like very, very\ngood quality newsletter. I love it. Thank you, Morning Brew\nfor sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the story and talk about what is going on\nin the Belgian Congo. So Leopold decided to take\nthings into his own hands. With his own money and his own army. He knew he would need\nsome support for this in terms of just like approval. So he created an organization, that he called the\nInternational African Society. Leopold builds this organization, and says that it's meant to be a research and philanthropy organization. With a mission to explore\nthe world for good and for science. But soon, Leopold would use this organization to get his wish of being a big boy colonizer. It was 1884 when a bunch\nof the European and Ottoman and American powers who\nwere colonizing Africa got together and they decided that they needed some\nsort of a unifying policy of how they were going to go into Africa, how trade was going to work. But they wanted to work together as they carved up the continent of Africa. Leopold gets up at this conference, it was in Berlin, and he says, listen, I've\ngot this organization. I would love to take this\norganization of mine and go and take over a huge\nswath of central Africa. And everyone's like, you\nmean like Belgium is going to go take over the Congo? And he's like, no, no,\nno, not Belgium, me. I'll do it with my own money. And the European powers\nare sort of like, okay. Like how much harm can one\nguy and his NGO do going into Congo? So Leopold gets his dream. He gets international approval\nto go take over a swath of Africa that is 76\ntimes larger than Belgium. He would call his new private\ncolony, the Congo Free State. Well, you know what happens next. He doesn't improve the lives of people. That was never his intention. Instead, his army quickly gains control over the local population and starts to use the locals to forcibly extract raw\nmaterials from the land of Congo. Mainly in rubber, whose price was going up during the Industrial Revolution. And in ivory. He would put these quotas\non the local people that they had to get a\ncertain amount of rubber. And he would instruct his\narmy that if they didn't bring back their quota, that they were to go remove\ntheir hands or limbs. This is everyone. Men, women and children who are being forced to\nwork for King Leopold and getting their limbs removed if they don't meet the quota. So, Leopold starts extracting huge amounts of wealth from the Congo. And he uses this new money to build big shiny things back in Belgium. Including this big,\nbeautiful park and archways that I used to bike past all the time when I lived in Belgium. Or this beautiful train\nstation in central Antwerp. Wait a minute. That train station looks kind of familiar. (uplifted whistling music) Yeah, that's me showing\nHenry the clock tower in this train station. I had literally no idea that\nthis train station was built on the blood of people in the Congo. Okay, so I know you're wondering what is this terrible story have anything to do with vaccines and Johnson\n& Johnson and the pandemic? Here it goes. Buckle up. So while Leopold is doing\nall this terrible stuff in the late 1800s, almost the 1900s, something happens in neighboring Uganda. An epidemic breaks out of this mysterious disease\ncalled sleeping sickness. This is what they called it. They didn't really know what it was. But Leopold catches wind of the fact that there's a disease spreading into the Congo where he\nhas all these people, and this giant operation\nfor wealth extraction. And he sort of freaks out. He's like my whole wealth\noperation might get wiped out by this random epidemic. So, he decides to put out a cash prize for anyone who can go down and devise a solution or a remedy to the sleeping sickness. And then he starts to\ninvest in actual researchers and scientists, to go down to the Congo and start studying tropical diseases. To make sure that nothing catches him by surprise and wipes out his operation. Okay, well eventually\nthe world catches wind of all the terrible things\nthat King Leopold II is doing in the Congo. And they start to mount\npressure against Belgium the country, and the actual\ngovernment of Belgium to put an end to this. It's 1908, and finally\nthe Belgian government is like, dude, stop, like you're done. And they officially take\nLeopold out of the driver's seat and they annex the Congo for themselves. And the Congo becomes an\nofficial Belgian colony for the first time. But these scientists and researchers who Leopold set up to start looking into tropical diseases, they didn't leave. They stayed. They kept doing this work\nand they actually started to make some really\nimportant breakthroughs. They establish an official\nstate run organization called the Prince Leopold\nInstitute for Tropical Medicines. An institution that was leading the world in understanding tropical medicines and teaching research and\nstudy about this topic. This organization was based\npermanently in the Congo, as well as, in Belgium. Fast forward a few years,\nand the Congo officially declares independence from Belgium. - With political independence from Belgium control of the entire\nCongo was turned over to what is called the\nCentral Congo Government, with headquarters in Leopoldville. - By this time, all of the holdovers from the King Leopold\ndays are sort of gone. And now the Institute\nfor Tropical Medicine is actually like a legitimate institute that is doing groundbreaking,\ncutting edge research and study on all sorts of pathologies, and viruses, and parasites\nand diseases in this region. They're basically leading the world in tropical diseases\nand understanding them. They moved their headquarters\nfrom Leopold's house in Brussels to the city of Antwerp where that beautiful but\nterrible train station is. And they sort of turn into like a school, like an institution where they're training researchers to then go out\nand work in the real world. Okay. So here's where it starts to really\nconnect with modern day. You have the Institute\nof Tropical Medicine, which was effectively built from King Leopold's\noperation in the Congo. A lot of the researchers and students from the Institute of Tropical Medicine were graduating and moving on and joining particularly\none pharmaceutical company, that was a Belgian pharmaceutical company, that was down the road from the Institute of Tropical Medicine. This pharmaceutical\ncompany was called Janssen. And as researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine joined Janssen Pharmaceuticals\nthey continue to do that groundbreaking work around the world. Developing many of the medicines that the WHO considers\nessential medicines. - [Reporter] Vaccines,\nserums, medicines, and drugs. - They continue to do work\nin the Congo, for example. Where, just recently,\nthey developed the vaccine for Ebola in the Congo. - [Female Reporter] A\nBelgian doctor was part of an international team\nthat was called to Yambuku in the heart of the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo. - This is their old stomping grounds where so much of this\nunderstanding of different viruses, and parasites, and diseases was founded during the King Leopold days. But instead of the colonizing efforts of the early 1900s, now\nthese institutions are actually doing really good work, and actually saving lots of lives. In 1960 Janssen Pharmaceutical, which is full of all these Institute of Tropical\nMedicine researchers, gets purchased by a New Jersey company\ncalled Johnson & Johnson. - [Announcer] Made only\nby Johnson & Johnson, the most trusted name\nin surgical dressings. \u266a In the language of love \u266a - And yes, this pharmaceutical\ncompany Janssen, which is now a division\nof Johnson & Johnson was the actual company\nthat developed the miracle COVID-19 vaccine that is\nsaving the world today. - [Reporter] Today,\nJanssen Pharmaceutical, as part of healthcare\ngiant Johnson & Johnson announced this. - The chairman of Janssen, by the way, is a graduate of the Institute\nof Tropical Medicine. Their long legacy in the Congo, and their focus on scientific research around tropical diseases is what gave them the capability to be able\nto step up to the task and create a vaccine for COVID-19. In other words this, led\nto this, led to this, led to this, led to this. - [Reporter] The first J&J doses expected to go into American's arms\nwithin 24 to 48 hours. - Again, we think it's really important for our country and the world. - Okay. So I know this\nsounds like I'm doing some sort of like expos\u00e9\non Johnson & Johnson and Janssen, and they're like dark past. I'm not. The work that they're\ndoing today is amazing. It is saving so many lives. The Institute of Tropical Medicine is an amazing public health institution that does really really useful work for saving many lives around the world. And yet, when you trace back the roots of why this institution exists and the original motives for it, they're pretty (beep) up. - [Female Reporter] His 23\nyear reign was so brutal that the population halved, while Leopold and his men\namassed huge personal fortune. - What this story teaches\nme is just how impossible it is to find an institution\nthat wasn't founded on some bloody dark past. The country I live in, and the\ndemocracy that I am proud of is founded on blood of stolen\npeople from another continent. How do I evaluate something\nthat I think is good when I really understand\nthat the backstory behind it is terrible,\nand bloody, and horrific? The fact that this lifesaving\ngame-changer vaccine has a legacy that is based\non a greedy horrific King massacring a bunch of people in the Congo is a really uncomfortable tension. But if you look close enough, it's one that exists in\nnearly everything around us."

    "title": "The Fastest Way to Learn a New Language: The Video Game Map Theory",
    "video_id": "3i1lNJPY-4Q",
    "captions": "- Learning a language is\nkind of like a video game. I mean kind of, not exactly the same, but let me explain. (tranquil piano music) I'm not a big gamer. I've played my fair share\nof Super Smash Brothers, but that was like when I was a teenager. But lately, I'm getting back into it. We got a Nintendo Switch. I've been playing it with my boys. Zelda, this cool game called Cardo has to do with maps, good times. Another thing I've been\ndoing during quarantine is not traveling. Last fall when I started realizing that COVID wasn't going away, I would not be traveling anytime soon. I decided to get my travel buzz by learning a new language, Italian. The language that is spoken\nin my favorite region on Earth right up here. Four months ago, I didn't\nspeak a word of Italian and today, (speaking foreign language). So I've been driving back from work and speaking to myself in Italian. I am feeling my head. There's like a physical\nbuzzing that happens. (speaking foreign language) For the past three months, I've been studying Italian in the morning and playing video games\nwith my kids at night. I recently started to realize\nhow some of the major lessons from video games can be applied\nto learning a new language and to do so in a much more efficient way than was taught to us in school. By the end of this video, I\nwant to explain this concept of video games and language learning and I want to give you my best takeaways on teaching yourself a new language. So back to video games. My favorite video games\nare ones with maps. You'd be surprised, he's a big map guy. He loves maps, I know,\nI'm like a walking cliche. I just like maps. So if learning a language is\nsort of like a video game, here's the map of the video game. This is the learning language journey. You start here knowing nothing\nabout your new language and your goal is to beat the final boss, this elusive idea of fluency. In other words, when you start your Link and you just woke up from 100 year nap and you have three hearts\nand no weapons and no stamina and no skills and no powers and you don't speak the language, where you want to be is like this. Having lots of skills and tools\nto navigate a conversation with precision and\nskill and beat the game. In other words, to become fluent. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is a moment, this is a\nthing I need to distinguish, a distinction we need to make. What is fluency? What does that even mean? I'll turn the question\non you gamers out there. What does it mean to beat a video game? One person will tell you\nthat beating a video game means just beating the main storyline, beating the main boss,\nGanon, Bowser, whatever. I can already feel some\nof you shaking your heads because there are lots of you\nout there that say no, no, no, beating a video game\nmeans beating everything. All of the challenges,\nall of the little things like beating the shrines and\ngetting all the Korok seeds and all the other things\nthat have nothing to do with the main storyline. You have to beat them all or\nyou haven't beaten the game. So here's where the connection\nbetween language learning and the video game concept comes together. When you're learning a\nlanguage in language school or most formal programs,\nthe map looks like this. You start here knowing nothing and the journey to beat\nthe game to become fluent is a long windy path with lots of gates and trials and gatekeepers. There are soldiers who are standing guard, making sure that you beat them before you go on to the next step. You can't progress along this path until you've memorized how to conjugate the present imperative tense\nincluding the irregular forms. So you study them, you study, study, study just to make it pass\nthis first gatekeeper. You don't even really know\nwhat present imperative means but you look at the book, you memorize it and you do what you need to do to show up and pass the test so that you can move on to the next thing that\nthey're teaching you in this school formal environment. So then you move on and you\nget to the next gatekeeper in the trial, which is you can't move on until you've memorized the\nsubjunctive conjugations. And you're like what\ndoes subjunctive mean? And it's just like I don't know, but you need to go memorize it. Oh, and memorize this random list of 20 words that we think are important. It's the only way to fluency. If you want to be fluent, you\nhave to get through this gate. I'll memorize the subjunctive. You keep going on your journey,\npassing the gatekeepers, memorizing the concepts\nthat are in the book that the teacher is telling you and the idea here is that if you beat all of these gatekeepers and\nyou memorize all these rules, you make it to the final level and you beat the final boss\nand then you are fluent. The problem is this\nisn't a fun video game. It's actually a grueling process of memorizing abstract ideas. So people don't actually beat\nthe video game very often. They usually give up around\nhere and they say F it and they throw in the towel and they feel like language\nlearning is just not for them. Meanwhile, some of us beat the game. Like I actually beat the game in college. I got a minor in French, like a minor. Like I studied French\nthrough all of the levels in college to get a minor. I beat this game and I\nfinally beat the final boss and got here to the end of the map and I had all the conjugations,\nthe direct object pronouns, the past conditional and\nauxiliary verbs and all of it. And then I go to Paris and\nI go to order a baguette and I realized that I literally don't know how to order a baguette in Paris even though I have a minor in French. There is nothing more\ndisappointing than that, it's sad. Luckily, there's a happy\nending to this video, this story that I'm telling you, but right now, it's just sad\nto think about getting a minor in French and then not actually\nbeing able to speak it. I need a little bit of a change of pace, I'm gonna crack open a bottle of wine. Which begins the next segment which is thanking today's sponsor who sent me a giant box\nfull of literal wine. Look at this. Whoops, check this out. This box arrived at my door two days ago. Inside of the box, there\nare some really cool things. So Bright Cellars who\nsponsored today's video sent me this box. They had me take a quiz\nbefore on things that I like, the type of food and the\ntypes of personality traits I have like all this whole quiz. And then they used the\ninformation from that quiz to send me this box of wine. What I like about this is\nbecause when I go to buy wine at a store, I have no guidance, like there's no guidance for me. I'm not super well-versed in\nall of the different variables that make good wine. I'd like to be, but\nit's big and complicated and for someone to automate\nthat and to present it in a way that's fun and like sort of empowering\nwith information, that's actually my favorite\npart about the whole thing is they will send me these\ncards for each bottle of wine that has a little infographic on it. I like infographics, that's like my thing. There's maps and there is origins and there's a story about\nlike where this came from. There's flavor notes if you're\ninto the flavor notes game. For me, ritualistic things\nlike cheese and wine and all of it is way more enjoyable if there's a story associated with it. Bright Cellars is giving 50% off, which is half off for\nanyone who clicked the link in my description for\nyour first six bottles. So you could sign up for this sweet thing, get six bottles for 50% off\nand it's a really good deal. And again, the convenience,\nthe information, the experience of this is really cool. I'm excited, I'm excited to explore this and have some knowledge and\nstory associated with it. So thank you Bright Cellars\nfor sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the story of learning Italian\nthrough a video game map. I beat the game. I got here and realized\nthat this version of fluency was one where I had a deep\nunderstanding of French grammar. I even had an understanding\nof its history, I could read literature in French, I could write properly, I knew where all the accents went, I even had a decent pronunciation but I couldn't speak the damn language. When I traveled to France,\nwasn't that the whole point? For all you Zelda people out here, let's just say I had\ngathered all the Korok seeds and beat all the shrines but still hadn't beat\na single divine beast. The thing that actually mattered to me, the thing I wanted to do, what if I decided that this isn't where I wanted to go at all? This version of fluency wasn't important. This isn't the game I want to play. What if we decided to\ntake a different approach, a different path, a much simpler goal. And what if that goal were as simple as I want to be able to\ntravel to a foreign country and be able to speak to the locals and have them understand me and be understood when they speak to me. Is that revolutionary like\nno mastery of grammar, no perfect pronunciation, no ability to read and\nwrite with any elegance, no literature or cultural\nhistory of the language, just the ability to use\nwords to communicate and then to understand the response. Nothing else, no (squeaky\ntoy sound) Korok seeds. I can already hear the comments, but you're learning a language. You have to know the grammar\nor you won't be fluent. Or in other words, if you don't gather all the Korok seeds, you didn't beat the game. Listen, if my definition\nisn't fluency for you, I don't want your\nfluency, I don't need it. I just want to be able to go on a trip and speak to the locals\nand ask for directions and have a conversation with\na taxi driver and order food. That is all I want. I'm being a little snarky here because the language learning\ncommunity on the internet has some very strong\nopinions and expectations about what real language\nlearning looks like. You may see them in\nthe comments telling me that my Italian actually isn't valid because I don't understand\nthe past conditional tense. Not sure how to respond to that, but I reject your objection. So a few months ago, I\nset out to test this out to see what this destination looks like. Not this, but this. I learned a lot and ended up making an entire course about it with my friend Nathaniel Drew, but I want to summarize\nthe major things I learned and share them with you. (speaking foreign language) Before I dive in and give you\nexactly the things I learned in this process, let\nme do a few disclaimers that might be helpful to some of you who actually want to take away\nsome value from this video. Number one is that this is my experience. It's my experience, it applies to me and my unique situation. It worked well and it may work for you and it may not work for you, but don't see this as like\na plug and chug formula, that is not what this is. This is my perspective and my experience. Number two, I want it to be clear that I spoke literally zero Italian in like October of last year. I am fluent in Spanish,\nwhich is a romance language, which is like a cousin to\nItalian and I did study French in college as I've mentioned 57 times. So I had some advantage but the reality is I knew zero Italian. I could say things like\nciao and like that was it. (speaking foreign language) That's what matters,\nthat's what I care about. I rejected this and I\nthink there's a better way. That doesn't mean it's easy, it means that it's just more direct. There are still trials, they're just the most\nefficient trials you need and here they are. Number one, not all\nwords are created equal. The first thing I did was to\nassess what are the most common and useful 1,000 words in a language and solely focus on those, completely blocking out all others. This isn't a new concept. Scholarly research shows\nthat this is very useful and history does too. I last year was reading a lot about American imperialism\nfor obvious reasons and I stumbled upon this wild story. After World War II, the British and Americans who had just won the war wanted to spread the English language throughout the whole world. So they adopted a stripped down version that they called basic. They were carefully selected words. There were the most frequently used and most useful 850 words in the language. By the way, English has\nlike over 150,000 words. And this language created\nby a linguist of English was only 850 words and they use this to go promulgate\nEnglish around the world. They're like anyone in the world can learn English very quickly if they just have to\nlearn these 850 words. The inventor of the\nlanguage once said quote it takes 400 words of\nbasic to run a battleship. And with 850 words,\nyou can run the planet. He literally said that like\nthis is an extreme version of what I'm talking about here. Some words are more important than others. And if you just memorize those words, those words that you\nactually are gonna use, then you can like supercharge your language learning process. Now this is where my friend Nathaniel Drew comes into the story. Nathaniel is a guy who\nloves languages like I do and he also believes in\nthis more direct path. So he's challenged\nhimself to learn as much of a new language as quickly\nas he possibly can on his own. By the way, much to the\nchagrin of language learning internet communities who love to say that people are learning\nlanguages the wrong way because it doesn't fit their model. In doing so, Nathaniel\nrealized the same thing that British and American\ngovernments realized in like the 40's that if you just prioritize\nthe most vital words, the ones that you actually use, you can rapidly acquire a language if you block out all of\nthe words and only focus on the most important. Nathaniel had made a list of what he deemed to be some\nof the most important words for his life and for just\neveryday communication. He gave me that list and I added to it. I did a bunch of research on the data of most frequently used words and I put it together\ninto a list of 1,000 words that I think are the startup kit, the most important words\nyou need to memorize. The ingredients, the\nbuilding blocks of language. This is the first step. Before you do anything else, memorize the most important\nwords of a language. How do you memorize all these words? I'm not gonna go into it right now. I have this box that I\nuse that has all my words and in the course that we made, I go into exactly how this thing works. It's based on all the psychology\nthat forces these words into your long-term memory. The point is memorize the most vital frequently used words first, and your life will be a lot easier in learning this language. I saw this just recently,\nlike I went from knowing zero words in Italian\nto within the first week knowing 200 words of Italian. You can't speak super well with just 200 words and no grammar, but you can certainly\nstart to express yourself. (speaking foreign language) I kept memorizing and\nsoon I had like 500 words and you won't believe what 500 words can do for your ability to communicate. This gets to the second trial\non our video game adventure, which is start talking early. Language isn't math. In math, there are laws. If you break those laws,\nyour equation won't work. You literally get the wrong answer. There are wrong answers\nand right answers in math. If my four year old son\nsays two plus two equals 22, I will say no, son, that's wrong. Two plus two equals four. But if my son says\nyesterday, I eated a apple. I wouldn't say no son,\nyesterday you ate an apple. Get it right next time. No, I wouldn't say that. The kid said words, I understood them and it worked, that's\nlanguage, it isn't math. It's an expressive part\nof our human experience that is very intuitive and\nvery flexible and messy like human culture and relationships. It is not math. When we approach language like this, we make language feel like math. Like if we don't get the\nconjugations correct, it'll be like we're saying\ntwo plus two equals 22 and you'll be totally wrong\nand no one will understand you. And all that does is make\nyou nervous and averse to actually speaking in real time. But watch this. I'm about to show you me speaking Italian a month and a half, six\nweeks after studying it, going from zero words to a few 100 words and trying to speak it. Speaking with a native in Italy over Skype and spoiler alert for\nthose Italian speakers, my grammar is horrible. (speaking foreign language) But guess what, she understood me. I was communicating in a\ndifferent language with somebody. It's not pretty, it's not linguistically\ncorrect, but it's communication. What I'm proposing is that\nthis is the alternative path, this is the goal, not getting\nthe mathematical equations of grammar and syntax correct. As you memorize loads of words, the next most important step\nis to get yourself speaking as soon as possible. You'll have to do this eventually if you want to speak the language and it's awkward and painful. And so you should start\nearly right away on week one of learning the language\nand you should get on one of these services and start communicating\nwith a native speaker. And now I'm about to say\nsomething that actually pains me which is after two months of this, just memorizing tons of words and having weekly Skype\nconversations with a native Italian, I was speaking better Italian more fluently than I was French. I eclipsed my French capabilities\nfrom a verbal standpoint, not from a grammar standpoint, but from a verbal expressive standpoint after two months, compared\nto four years of work. I'm not saying it was\nfluent after two months, I'm just saying that my\nexperience after two months was stronger than my four\nyears of college French. That's like actually\nsad for me in some ways because there's so much\ntime of me learning French and there's a better way. In the course that I mentioned, we go into a deep dive on\nall the types of activities that I do in one of these sessions with a native speaker\nthat helps make it useful, but I'm not gonna go into that right now. Gate number three, you\ngot to make this fun. Another major thing missing\nfrom this model is fun. Positive association is how it's called in behavioral psychology. The idea that your brain\nwants to do something if last time they did\nit, it was sort of fun. Language learning is hard, it requires many months and years. How do you keep it up? You make it interesting and fun. Grammar drills and\nmemorization are not fun so you have to find ways to\nmake it a positive experience. For me, that is reading\nan Italian cookbook that has Italian language\nthat I can translate and think about Italian cuisine,\nwhich is something I love. I also started listening\nto Harry Potter in Italian which I didn't understand\na single word at first but then I got the Kindle version and I sort of followed along digitally and translated some words\nwhile I was listening and now I can like\nunderstand probably 80 to 90% of Harry Potter cause I love Harry Potter. Don't love JK Rowling\nthough, love Harry Potter. So make it fun. The last and final gate in\nthis more direct journey to be able to speak a language is the one that people who have\nlearned other languages have been waiting for me to say and they're angrily being like dude, you got to mention this and\nI'm gonna say it, which is yes. Eventually, you have to learn the rules. You have to learn grammar. You have to learn pronunciation\nand you have to refine it through drills and\nthrough a lot of practice. Intentionally, I'm putting this last because I think you should too. The previous concepts\nare way more important. Get your first 500 or\n1,000 words memorized in your long-term memory. Start speaking every week\nwith a native speaker, make the journey fun, and then\nstart to think about grammar and start to think about all\nof the rules and the irregulars and the syntax and the\ndirect object pronouns and the past participles. You can do that after\nmaybe two, three months of like being in the trenches. The best part about this\nis that by that time, you'll be in a place where you\ncan communicate basic ideas so that when you do look at the grammar, it actually fits into the context that you've intuitively\ndeveloped of expression. It won't just be like in a vacuum of memorizing arbitrary rules, it'll actually apply to something. And that makes it way more\ninteresting to actually memorize. I didn't start really going into grammar until just recently, three months into the\nprocess of learning Italian. And it makes a lot more sense. So that is what I've learned about learning another language,\nit's like a video game. You don't need to gather\nall the Korok seeds to beat the game. You don't, some people think you do. I'm not gonna listen to those people. For me, to beat the game, you just need to be able\nto talk and be understood. This is my experience,\nthis is my version of it. And again, in the course, I go deeper into exactly\nhow this goes down. The course that me and Nathaniel did is like three and a half hours of like nitty gritty techniques\nand all of this stuff, but the message is what\nI've told you here, which is that there's a\nbetter way to learn languages than the way we learned it in school. I will be studying Italian for years, but the beautiful thing is\nnext time I go to Italy, which who knows when that's gonna be, but at some point I'll go to\nItaly, I'll show up to a cafe and I'll be able to speak. I'll be able to talk and be understood and that's what matters to me. So I hope that's what matters to you too. Thanks for watching. (speaking foreign language)"

    "title": "How Justin Timberlake Escaped #NippleGate",
    "video_id": "jUTdeKJ4r-M",
    "captions": "- This video is sponsored by Squarespace. Come on, there it goes, one, two, three. (papers shuffling)\nLet's do this. It's 2004, the Super Bowl. Jessica Simpson just\nannounced the beginning of the halftime show. The show starts with Janet\nJackson and then Nelly and his crew riding out on a red truck to sing a song about it\nbeing very hot in here and telling women to... \u266a Take off all your clothes \u266a \u266a I am getting so hot \u266a\n- Then Puff Daddy or P. Diddy or just Diddy\nI guess or Sean Combs, or whatever you want to call him. And then the finale of the halftime show, back to Janet Jackson but this time, in the final moments\nof this whole, big show superstar Justin Timberlake\ncomes onto stage. Him and Janet Jackson\nperform one of Timberlake's most popular songs, \"Rock Your Body.\" The final line of that song says, quote, \"Bet I'll have you naked\nby the end of this song.\" It feels really weird\nto say that in quotes. Anyway, as that last line approaches, Justin Timberlake moves\nclose to Janet Jackson to prepare for that final\nline and then this happens. \u266a Naked by the end of this song \u266a (crowd cheering)\n(soft instrumental music) - [Johnny] Okay, hold on, instant replay. And yes, I'm blurring\nthis because I have to. It's YouTube and I just\nhave to blur this moment. Justin Timberlake reaches\nover and pulls the breast cup of Janet Jackson's shirt, ripping it off to reveal her breast for\njust over a half a second to an audience of millions of people. This moment was a spark\nthat lit a wildfire. - Was it planned, Janet? - Tell us exactly what happened. - Last week's shameful halftime display. (upbeat pop music) - We love giving y'all\nsomething to talk about. - Closer, let me inch... (men shouting and laughing) - Publicity stunt. (sighs) Okay. I was really young when this all happened, but I have been deep in\nit reading newspapers and stuff from that time\nand I didn't realize that this half a second of exposed breast became an inflection point in TV and internet history, in American history. Suddenly the whole world\nwanted to talk about it, to scrutinize it, to\nfind out what happened and why, who's to blame. The founder of YouTube\nactually said in an interview that one of the reasons he started YouTube was because of this moment\nbecause so many people wanted to rewatch a\nvideo of what went down and they couldn't find\nit because back then there was no YouTube,\nthere was no Facebook, there was no Twitter. So he literally invented\nYouTube to solve the problem. People wanted to see this, to\nscrutinize it, to look at it. The internet searches for\nJanet Jackson went bonkers. There was such a massive influx of people searching the internet\nthat Janet's webpage, which back then was just\nlike a fan page, crashed. Like, if you go back to look\nat the archives of the internet there's just like a black spot in the days after the Super Bowl because literally there was so much traffic\nthat it just crashed the site. Janet Jackson was under this microscope. Everybody wanted to have an opinion. The whole thing spurred a debate about how families should be\nable to watch the Super Bowl without being exposed to lewd,\nsexually provocative content. \u266a So take off all your clothes \u266a \u266a My hookers all drinking at Hollywood \u266a - No, no, no, not that stuff, that's fine. There was a boob. A real-life boob for 1/2 a second on TV. That's what we're talking\nabout, stay focused. The White House issued a\nstatement on the topic. Congress had a hearing about this. The FCC, which is the place\nthat regulates broadcasters here in the US launched an investigation into whether or not CBS, who broadcast the Super\nBowl, was in on it. - Last week's shameful halftime\ndisplay at the Super Bowl You knew it was going to happen, right? You did know what was going to happen? - No, I didn't. - [David] You didn't\nknow it was gonna happen? - Janet Jackson's explanation\nfor this whole thing is that it was a stunt but it\nwent wrong, it went too far. - It was supposed to\nkind of happen like that, but what actually happened wasn't, I wasn't supposed to come\nout of it the way that I did. - Janet said that what\nwas supposed to happen is that Justin Timberlake rips this off and there was supposed\nto be a bra underneath and it was supposed to\nbe kind of provocative but not like, full breast. - It was very embarrassing for me to have so many people see. - But people didn't believe this. With the media discussion\nand the congressional hearing and the FCC investigation people started to make their own opinions about what they believed actually happened and who was to blame. - Tonight Janet Jackson is\napologizing for her flashdance, a last-minute stunt that went too far. - The chairman of the\nFCC concluded, quote, \"Clearly somebody had knowledge of it. Clearly it was something that was planned by someone,\" he said. And then he said, quote, \"She probably got what\nshe was looking for,\" referring specifically to Janet Jackson. So the FCC fines CBS for\nlike a half a million dollars and this makes the CEO of CBS so angry that he becomes fixated on\nruining Janet Jackson's life. He made sure that she was blacklisted from all of the major music\nvideo networks like MTV and VH1 and all CBS-owned radio stations. Now, radio stations, how quaint. Remember, this is 2004. There's no Spotify,\nthere's no Apple Music. Radio stations were the place\nwhere your music got out. So was MTV, remember TRL? Anyone remember TRL? - At number one, closing out the week, here's \"Larger than\nLife,\" the Backstreet Boys (crowd cheering)\non TRL. - Come on, TRL, Carson Daly? I'm getting old. It's fine. I thought Carson Daly was pretty cool. Janet Jackson was cut\noff from all of this, the lifeblood of her career\nbecause she was thought to have duped the country into\nher perverse sexual stunt. But wait a minute, can we just rewatch\nthe video really quick? Let's just, like, look\nat who did what to whom. What about this guy, the guy\nwho actually did the thing? So here I am all these years\nlater, I'm a big boy now, and I am a journalist. I think about how words\nare used to communicate and inform the public. The power of words, how we frame things. I started to dive in to the\nreporting from this time, looking at hundreds of major newspapers and how they covered what\nhappened at the Super Bowl, this thing that became\nknown as Nipplegate. If you do this, if you\nreally immerse yourself in the news of the time,\nhow it was being discussed and especially with a\nlittle bit of hindsight you can really learn a lot\nabout what really happened here. So first off, let me\nget this out of the way. I delved into all of the investigations, all of the evidence of whether\nor not this was planned from the FCC and the CBS and all the people who were involved. Was this an accident or\nwas this a publicity stunt? Turns out, if you examine all the evidence it's actually impossible to ascertain a conclusive answer on\nwhether or not it was planned by Janet Jackson or Justin\nTimberlake or others. You can make up your\nown opinion about this, but there are a few things\nthat I can say for certain as I immerse myself in this stuff. Number one, how the\nincident was characterized. Now listen, I like data. Talking about how an\nincident was characterized is hard to put into data\nunless you aggregate a bunch of news articles and\nlook at the language they use to talk about this event. If you look at 200 news\narticles from major newspapers that covered this event,\nin half of these articles Justin Timberlake's involvement\nis mentioned in passing. It is not the focus of the article. And even 1/3 of them, 1/3, 30% don't even mention\nJustin Timberlake at all. He's completely absent from\n1/3 of these 200 articles. Sorry, can we just rewind,\nwatch the video again? Can we just watch it one more time. So this happened and 33% of the articles didn't mention this guy. Wait, what, why not? If you're a reporter and\nyou say, this happened you should mention who did the thing. Number two is the importance of language. Language, language, language. The words you use, the syntax you use to construct your sentence matters. And I know this, I know this for a fact because I do this every day. I sit at a computer and\nI construct language to communicate ideas. So this, this is my sweet\nspot, and I have a lot to say. I'm looking at some of these\narticles from the 2004 incident and the language that is used\nto describe what happened, which again, is very important especially in a pre-visual\nweb video internet age, the language you use is very important. \"The New York Times,\" the\nreputable \"New York Times\" described the incident as, Janet Jackson's breast-baring fiasco. Another article framed this\nas, Janet Jackson, quote, flashed one breast in front of the largest television\naudience of the year in the Super Bowl halftime show. In normal English syntax you\nhave an agent, you have a verb, and you usually have an object,\nsomething that happened. So some person or something\ndoes, verbs, something else. In this case, Janet Jackson was the agent. She flashed her breast in front of the largest\naudience of the year. No mention of anyone else. \"Washington Post,\" 2004, quote, what Janet Jackson did was bizarre, deliberately flopping out\nof her costume like that. The syntax, the lack of any other agent, any other actionable person in this scene, that frames this event in very clear terms for a reader to decide\nwho's to blame here. A lot of this reporting\nturns Justin Timberlake, the guy who actually pulled the breast cup off of Janet Jackson's\nclothing into the victim. \"The Boston Globe\" says that, quote, Justin Timberlake reached over\nto that infamous right breast belonging to Janet Jackson. Reached over to that\ninfamous right breast. Like the breast was inherently infamous. It was just waiting for\ninnocent Justin Timberlake to like, stumble into\nthe trap, (scoffs) what? How can a breast be infamous? Can somebody like, describe, like? Comment below, how can\na breast be infamous? These reports frame Janet\nJackson as the provoker and Justin Timberlake as\nthe innocent bystander being lured into the trap. - All the emphasis was put on me. - Mm-hmm.\n- Not on Justin. - Language matters. I'm not just nitpicking\nlittle teeny, tiny words here. This is how you frame something. As a journalist reporting\nthe facts is a process of deciding what language you use and what facts you choose to include. The language used here clearly pushes the\naudience in one direction. I mean, do you disagree? Like, I'm sorry, am I being totally misinterpreting here of this? I'm trying to give the most\nhonest and generous read to all of this and really\ntry to see it clearly, and this is what it says\nto me very, very clearly from a data perspective. I am looking at a lot of articles. Okay, our third takeaway is,\nwho felt the fallout from this? Whose career got F'd up? Janet Jackson, not Justin Timberlake. There was a dog-pile onto\nJanet Jackson, blacklisting her from the radio, from MTV, from VH1. Meanwhile Justin Timberlake\nskirted by basically unscathed. In all of the interviews,\nJanet is so apologetic and ashamed and embarrassed while Justin is sort of just like... - Hey man, we love giving\ny'all something to talk about. - His career wasn't really touched by this even though he's the guy who did this. Janet, on the other hand, became the most viral\nthing in internet history. And I'm not just being hyperbolic there. This is considered the most-searched event in the history of the internet. And the search is Janet\nJackson exposing her breast. It's not Justin Timberlake\nripping off a piece of clothing. That is not the search. The search is Janet Jackson. Okay, my last takeaway, and\nthis is the one that like, I don't really understand and I want to have a\nbetter understanding of and I'm actually left a little\nbit confused which is that humans love this stuff, humans love it. Our brain, for some reason, is predisposed to love and fixate and just\ndevour this sort of content. It's human psychology at its\nmost basic and predictable form and I don't really understand why. Let's remember the setting. This is 2004, early 2004. It's an election year. George Bush is up for election. A few months earlier George\nBush and his administration had led us into a war in Iraq which, as I've covered in previous videos, was largely a war of choice. And now our taxpayer money is being used to wage a war halfway around the world looking for fake WMDs and yet this, this half a second of an exposed breast was the epicenter of our attention. This is what mattered. This is what warranted discussion\nand congressional hearings and tons of conversation. This woman and her body and her behavior. - [Reporter] What part of the Super Bowl did you like the best,\nthe halftime or the game? (onlookers laughing) - I'm not trying to be\nthe woke police here. I'm not trying to convince you of anything other than what I am seeing\nand what I am finding as I look at this with clear perspective and with some understanding of\nhow language and media works now that I've lived a little bit of life. If I'm missing something, let me know. But let me be clear about something. This wasn't an isolated incident. This sort of biased coverage and scrutiny wasn't new in 2004 and\nit certainly didn't stop. I remember when I first\nstarted working at Vox. We would have these\nmeetings and discussions about the YouTube comments. And I was publishing stuff on YouTube. I was showing my face\nmore and we were growing and it was exciting and I\nloved to read the comments and be like, whoa, look\nat all this excitement around the work we're doing. I was sort of naive and confused at first because I would put a video up and get all these cool comments. Wow, this guy's traveling\nthe world, it's super cool. And then I would read the comments any time we would put up a video where a woman, a female was the host. The comments were always\nso much more active and not with discussion about the video but about the host herself. Her voice, her hair, her clothing. I'm married to somebody who\nmakes videos for the internet. I see every comment that comes in. I see what you say to her\nversus what you say to me. It's as predictable as\nmy children's behavior. It is like a law of\nnature that the comments on her videos will focus so\nmuch on her touching her neck or the voice she's using\nor her interrupting me. It's like so predictable,\nit's like so simple, almost. What is it? Why do we love to shine\na spotlight on women and analyze and talk\nabout what they look like and how they behave? - Now, that's almost\nmalfunctioning, isn't it? (audience laughing)\n(laughing) Oh, wow. Man, you, very nice.\n(audience applauding) - Thank you. - By the way, you smell wonderful. - We just do, like, there's just something\ninside of us that does that. If you're resistant to this,\nI want to hear from you. What's the counterpoint to this? I'm seeing all this stuff. I'm not just coming with this 'cause this is cool and culturally trendy. I am seeing this in the data. I've seen this over years and years of observing mass human behavior with tens of thousands of data points. This is my conclusion, language matters and for some reason in our society our language around women is\nvery predictably scrutinizing and focused on behavior\nand voice and appearance. That, to me is a fact that I'm willing to just say very clearly. And the Janet Jackson fiasco isn't about whether or not it was a\nconspiracy or publicity stunt. You can have your opinions on that. But what's clear to me\nis that in this instance and in many other instances, it's a horribly predictable outcome. Same old story, and frankly, I\nfind it slightly embarrassing and unfortunate that it takes\nme looking through the data and reading loads of comments to convince me that this is real. It's almost like proof that\nthis is a deep part of my and all of our psychologies. Okay, that's all I've got. (sighs) Thank you, Squarespace,\nfor sponsoring this video.

    "title": "The US Military is EVERYWHERE",
    "video_id": "-YR2TxHkb4c",
    "captions": "- [Narrator] Imagine a world\nwhere the most powerful country on earth in 2021 wasn't the United States, but rather Spain. (dramatic suspenseful music) And instead of setting up military bases just in their own country,\nthey also set up bases all around the world. Lots of those bases\nare in former colonies, but also there's a bunch\nin the United States, just imagine this. You zoom in to Fayetteville,\nNorth Carolina, and you see a huge military base. But it's not a US military\nbase, it's a Spanish base on American soil, with lots of homes for the Spanish soldiers\nand their families, powerful weapons systems, aircraft, all run by the Spanish military. Go inside of one of these bases and it's all Spanish restaurants. Americans can't come in\nhere unless they work for the Spanish government. And then imagine 100 more of these all throughout the United\nStates on American soil, and hundreds of more throughout the world. Or shift the scenario a little bit, what if it was a country\nthat wasn't our ally, a country like China? What if they had military\nbases not in the US, but right up close to our border? Powerful weapon systems\nright off our shores in islands in the Caribbean. If you're an American, you have to imagine what that would feel like. If you're not an American, it's likely you already kind of know what this feels like. The United States has an extensive network of military bases outside of our borders, hundreds of bases. I've been fascinated for a very long time about understanding these\nUS foreign bases abroad, but I've never actually taken the time to accurately map them, so let's do it. Let's map every single US\nmilitary base around the world. It turns out that's a huge task. - [Man] This is the story of the men of the United States Army who\nmade this project possible, and of man's never seizing\nquest for knowledge. (offbeat dramatic music) - [Man 2] This is a full armored division. To give you an idea of size, each of those small dark squares includes more than 1,000 men. - The United States military is bigger than any of us can really fathom. It's so big that even the US military doesn't know how big the US military is. Back in 2018, 1200 independent accountants and analysts came in to try to audit the US Department of Defense, basically try to get a paper\ntrail of how big this thing is, how much money it spends, et cetera. And the Department of Defense\ndidn't pass the audit. They literally did not have the documents or the knowledge to really piece together a full scope of what this organization is, how big it is, how much money it spends. So we don't know, nobody knows how big the Pentagon is in all of its forms. All we do know is that objectively, it is one of the, if not the largest and most powerful\norganization on the planet and in the history of humanity. I mean if you have an organization that's more powerful than\nthe Department of Defense in the history of humans, let me know, I want to know about it,\nbut as far as I can tell, there's nothing bigger and more powerful than the United States military in 2021. And much of the US military\nis not actually in the US, but it's actually outside of our borders, all around the world. - [Man] This post is somewhere in Germany, overlooking a sector of the Iron Curtain. - One of the first things that Joe Biden and his administration did\nwhen they came into power a couple of weeks ago down the road was ask for an assessment of, how big is our military\npresence around the whole world? What is our strategy, and what actually does\nthis presence look like? - The Department will conduct\na global force posture review of US military footprint,\nresources, and strategies. - Footprint, I like that,\nthat's a nice thing, what's our footprint,\nhow big is our footprint around the world? We don't really know, the Pentagon is gonna start to try to assess that. So, let's help the Pentagon out and try to map every\nsingle United States base around the entire world. Let's do it. (offbeat dramatic music) It wasn't too long ago when I used to think that having military bases in other countries was totally normal. Doesn't every country have military bases in other countries? Yeah, anyway. This was sort of reinforced for me when I was in college. I didn't internship at\nNATO with the headquarters of NATO, which was in Brussels. To get this job, I had to get\na secret security clearance from the US government in order\nto enter the military base, which was NATO. This was really cool because there was always\npeople comin' through NATO that I got to meet. Like, my diplomacy hero Madeleine Albright who used to be the Secretary\nof State, or this guy. - It's a great honor\nrepresenting my country abroad for the last 37 years. - Good old Joe. Hey Joe, I had no idea\nyou'd be President someday. Anyway, the big benefit of having this secret security clearance is that I could go into\nany military base anywhere. And so on Saturdays, I would drive an hour from Brussels to a little village in the Belgian countryside\nwhere a military base had been sort of plopped down in the middle of the Belgian countryside in between stone walls and quaint streets, and sheep, and farming plots. Yeah, it's a little blurry in this map because it's, you know, a military base and sometimes they blur\nthe satellite imagery. Nothin' I can do about it, sorry. And as soon as I entered into the base, went through all the security\nand I was in the base, I felt like I had left Belgium and was suddenly entering\nsuburban American. - Welcome to the United States. - There was a Taco Bell and movie theaters with American movies,\nand all sorts of shops, and yoga studios, and a grocery store that had all of the products\nthat I was very used to, all at the same prices I could get them in the United States, even\nthough they had been flown across the Atlantic and\nbrought to this place, which is a very expensive thing to do. It was a dream for me\nas a poor college kid living in Brussels and\nfeeling a little bit homesick, to be honest, and really figured out culture shock at this point, so yeah, I kind of loved it. And I was again, sort of, doesn't everyone have military bases in other countries and\nthey can sort of just go to their military base, and it was just, I was so naive. Mmm, alas, I've learned the truth. (offbeat suspenseful music) Luckily, I was able to talk to somebody who literally wrote the book\non US military bases abroad. - Most US bases abroad look\nlike not-so-small US towns. - Over the years, David\nhas been researching and compiling a database of all the US bases around the world. The result is a very detailed audit that hasn't really ever\nbeen done to this degree. In fact, a few years ago, the\nPentagon's own research arm, the RAND Corp, was doing some research\non military bases abroad, and instead of using the Pentagon's list of US military bases abroad, these guys used David's\nlist, like they used David, it was like he was a professor, he's like an anthropologist,\nhe's not like a part of DoD. And yet they're like,\nthis list that he made is actually more authoritative\nthan the Pentagon's own list. - I mean I'm sort of honored, but it's not a good sign if\nthe Pentagon research arm is using my list and not\nthe Pentagon's own list. - So I got a hold of David's list and started wrestling with the data and finding a way to display it on a map so that I could get every single base to show somehow. After a few weeks of doing this, I finally have a map, and\nthat map looks like this. Every dot on this map\nis a US military base or installation of some\nsort in a different country. Many of these dots are not placed exactly where the base is,\nbecause many of these bases are clustered in areas. And if I try to map them\nall in the exact spot where they really are,\nthey would all just sort of stack on top of each other, and you wouldn't really\nbe able to see them. But these dots represent\nevery single base outside of the United States from huge complexes the size of Rhode Island\nto small air strips, little facilities that\nonly house American drones or radar, or supplies. This is all of them, and at\nleast all that we know of. If you look at this map and you see a base that you know of that is not here, or one that is there that\ndoesn't belong there, tell me about it, I want to know because this is sort of hard\ninformation to ascertain. The Pentagon is not very transparent, and neither are host countries about where certain bases are, and why they exist. - Many of the bases around the world are, their existence\nis due to an agreement between the two countries that is often not open to the public, that is a secret. Any errors here are mine and not David's. All in all, the number here is about 750. 750 US military bases big and small outside of the United States. By outside of the United States, I'm including US territories\nthat are not equal to the United States. Like Guam, Puerto Rico, et cetera. But in reality, we probably\ndon't know the real number because that data just simply is not transparently available to us. There are a couple of major clusters here where the most bases exist. One major one is Germany,\nand the others are Japan and South Korea. These are basically\nholdovers from World War II and the subsequent Korean War when the US, who won the war, came in and occupied these countries in order to set up a new government, write a new constitution, and\nto help the post-war transfer to the government. But, what's most interesting\nto me aren't these clusters that came about because of World War II, but instead the far-flung,\nsort of unexpected or little-known places that the US military\nhas a little footprint. All the dots in Africa, which have popped up in recent years, as the US has expanded its presence there. These are usually small installations that hold maybe a few soldiers, or mainly private citizens who\nare government contractors. And they mainly house things like drones, or radar, or weapons systems. You also have this cluster of dots deep in the Indian Ocean, which is the island of Diego Garcia, which I've talked about at length of the US military's role\nin displacing hundreds of local people to set up a base there. Some of these dots are just air strips, a runway in the middle of nowhere, and these runways usually\nbelong to the host country, and the US just rents\nthem for a period of time. Like this facility in the\nmiddle of the desert in Oman. Places like this exist to hold supplies in case a war breaks. So the US maintains these\nstockpiles of war supplies all around the globe\nso that they can strike at any point without having to ramp up a war economy at home. It takes away a lot of the\nfriction from going to war. - It made it easier for the US military to\nlaunch offensive force, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\nwere easier to launch because US has maintained a\nhuge infrastructure of bases. - Some of these dots\ndon't represent a place where US soldiers are actually stationed, but instead it represents\nwhere money from the Pentagon has gone to influence or\nbuild up infrastructure. For example, in Iceland,\nthe US is spending a lot of money, tens\nof millions of dollars, to upgrade this airport, the\nairport that we all go through when we're going to Iceland, but doing it for military purposes so that the US can use it,\ncan land there if needed. So next time you land in Iceland on your way to the Blue Lagoon, just know that you're passing\nby one of these little dots. Over here in the Azores, these islands that are owned by Portugal, nearly 2,000 kilometers\naway from any land mass, there is a group of US\nmilitary installations mainly used for refueling\nand weapon storage. And up here to Greenland, and you'll see a little base way up high, the most northern base in the world where 140 Americans live. Kinda looks interesting, would love to go there someday. Way out here in the\nPacific, you've got loads of remote military bases\nowned by the United States. They're mainly small air strips, like this base on the southern tip of this huge atoll of\nthe Marshall Islands. All right listen, I'm not gonna\nexplain every single base. There are 750, maybe 800. There's a bunch of bases,\nI just wanted to give you a flavor of what some of these look like. They're diverse, they're\nall over the place, and they're fascinating to me. I have been compiling\naccounts of people who live next to US military bases. I have over 100 accounts from people that, for Instagram, I want more. I wanna make an entire video\nabout life next to a base. And that is why I'm\ncalling it upon all of you. I'm gonna put a link in the\ndescription to a survey, it's a form, what it's like to live next to a US military base. I have it right here, and\nI'm gonna be checking it. You can fill out this form and then I will get your response, and I will read through your response, and I will use that to\nconstruct an understanding of what life is like next\nto a US military base. I talked to David a bunch about this too. He's done a bunch of research,\ndone a bunch of interviews, and I wanna keep talking about this. So, if you don't live\nnext to a military base, I wanna hear from you, what\nare your thoughts about this? Whether you're an American\nor not an American, does this seem right? Does this seem like the right choice, the right thing for our taxpayer money to be going towards? I'm still making up my mind\non a lot of this stuff, and I want to start a discussion. My goal in this video is to just map it, was to just look at it, be\nable to see it on a map, and I've finally done that. By the way, there will\nbe a high res version of this map on my Patreon for patrons who sign up for\nthe map background tier, that will be there. So I will be in the comments more than normal for this video, and I wanna hear from you. Before you go, I want to say thank you to the people who gave me a lot of footage for this piece. I didn't go out into\nthe desert and the ocean to film for this video, I got\na lot of it from Storyblocks, who is the sponsor to this video.

    "title": "The Man Putin Fears The Most",
    "video_id": "hrORwk_RZLM",
    "captions": "- There is one guy in Russia that Vladimir Putin, the president, fears more than anyone else. (indistinct chatter) He wears a lot of different hats. He's a political\nactivist, he's a YouTuber, he's kind of an internet troll. He's a lover of quality drone footage to help expose corruption, which like, come on, who doesn't love a good drone shot? (upbeat music playing) But his main objective is singular, it's very focused, it's to give the Russian people and all of us around the world, a peek behind the curtain to show how Russia really works. Exposing the web of\nbribes, corruption, lies, and powerful men who really\ncontrol modern Russia. This important figure who is seeking to dismantle Russia's web of corruption is named Alexei Navalny. And just last week, he was sentenced to three years in jail as well as being nominated\nfor a Nobel Peace Prize after being secretly\npoisoned on an airplane. (airplane whirling) The movement that he has created strikes at the heart of\nVladimir Putin's biggest fears and I wanna show you why. So let me introduce you to\nthe man Putin fears the most. - [Reporter] Alexei.\n- [Reporter] Alexei. - [Reporter] Alexei.\n- [Reporter] Alexei. - Russian opposition leader. - [Reporters] Alexei Navalny. (upbeat music) Okay, so let's rewind\nto summer of last year. Alexei Navalny is in a\ncity in Eastern Russia, he's in a hotel room, about to head to the\nairport to catch a flight. When he arrived to the airport, other passengers recognize him because he's kind of a big deal in Russia and they snap some photos with him. Then he gets on the flight, the flight takes off, it's a four hour flight from this city of Tomsk to Moscow where he's going. Everything's going normal for the first 30 minutes of this flight, but then Navalny starts to feel weird. A flight attendant offers him a bottle of water and he refuses, but soon this feeling weird\nturns into severe pain. (airplane whirling) He runs to the laboratory looking for some reprieve. He's going in and out of consciousness, he may be going into a seizure, his heart is slowing down, his muscles are convulsing and seizing, no one has any idea what's happening. A nurse aboard steps up and\nhelps keep him conscious while the pilots reroute\nfor an emergency landing at a nearby city in Russia. The plane lands at the closest airport where medics sprint\nonto the runway to help only for the medics to say, and I quote, this is not a case for us, he needs intensive care. Navalny is then rushed to a hospital but what happens inside this hospital is kind of mind blowing. (cameras flashing) When he gets to the hospital, they start running tests on him to see what's going on. But when the doctors come looking for the results of these blood tests, the lab technician hands them a blood test that says that Alexei\nNavalny is totally fine, nothing out of the ordinary, maybe a little bit of\nirritable bowel issues, but that's not what the doctor has seen. This man looks like he has been poisoned (airplane whirling) but the lab technician\ndidn't hand over any results that indicate that he was poisoned. Something is up. The doctors go ahead and\ngo with their instincts and treat him for poisoning because that is the symptoms\nthat they are seeing. They put them on a ventilator and they put him into a medically\ninduced coma to recover. Over the next few days, Alexei Navalny is in\nthe intensive care unit, in a coma, in this hospital. But the hospital starts to fill up, not just with doctors but Russian government officials who start barring people like his wife and his personal doctor\nfrom entering the room. Navalny and his family do not\nfeel safe in this hospital. It's at this time that a German humanitarian\nnon-profit organization offers to charter a jet to fly him from this town\nin Russia, out of Russia to be treated in Berlin. (upbeat music) Soon, he's on an airplane to Berlin where he arrives at a hospital and they run all of the\nsame poison blood tests that they did in Russia, but this time they find\nthat he was poisoned. This would have come up on the test they did in Russia, but somebody decided not to reveal that to the doctors. - Mr. Navalny remains in an induced coma at a Berlin hospital. - The German doctors are\nseeing that the poison that was somehow administered\nto Alexei Navalny is some crazy nerve poison that sends the victim\ninto a state of paralysis and gives nerve damage,\nand inducing seizures, and making their heart slow down. It's a poison that was developed by Soviet scientists during the Cold War. (cameras flashing) And they used it to quietly attack people they wanted to get rid of, like spies or double agents. It's called Novichok, and\nit is a brutal poison, and it was the poison that\nwas used on Alexei Navalny. - Tonight this incredible story, the most prominent\nRussian opposition leader is in a coma on a ventilator. - Now there's a lot of\nways to poison someone. You can use ingredients\nthat anyone has access to. Novichok is something\nthat is developed and used only by the Russian\nMilitary and Intelligence. In a sense, it's a signature, so Navalny goes back into\na medically induced coma in this hospital in Berlin where doctors are doing\ntheir best to treat him and also investigate what happened. Soon, the world would know\nexactly what happened. (recorder screeching) Okay, let's just pause for a second. Well, Alexei Navalny\nis in a coma in Berlin because we need to ask\nan important question which is, who is this guy, and why on earth is Soviet nerve poison being used against him? (bright upbeat music) For most of his adult life, Alexei Navalny has been\ndedicated to one thing, which is a shining light on how Russia really\nworks behind the scenes. Not this or this, but how it really works. One thing you need to know about Russia is that the whole society, the government, the business structures, everything, is built on a giant\nhouse of cards let's say. It's delicate, it's fragile, but it's the status quo and Putin is at the top. From there you have the\npeople closest to Putin's, the ones that have his ear, the rich Russian billionaires who control Russia's main industries like oil and gas, mining, telecoms, all the richest guys in Russia. These guys do favors for Putin and Putin does favors for\nthem in the political sphere. They scratch each other's back, and in doing so, they maintain control over everything that gets done in Russia. And this model repeats itself as it trickles down to\nregional governments and then to town and city governments who all operate in the same manner, keeping the society stable through a culture of bribery,\nsecrecy, and intimidation. And it all happens in the name of keeping Putin secure in his position so that he can in turn keep his rich friends happy. The reason why Putin fears Alexei Navalny is because Navalny wants all Russians to see exactly how this works, to shine a light on it which could easily turn the\npeople against the system, to knock down this house of cards from the ground up, to stop putting up with a government that works for the rich corporate owners and not for the people. And if this happens, it's Vladimir Putin who has the longest hardest fall. Okay, but here's the\njuiciest part of the story, and the part that got me\ninto this and that I love, which is that the tactics Navalny uses to do this shine a light\non the system thing, there's no better way to\ndescribe it than saying, he's full on trolling Vladimir\nPutin and his friends. (Alexei speaking Russian) He does this in a lot of ways, but what I love the most\nare his well-produced internet explainer documentaries. (Alexei speaking Russian) He makes these long videos exposing the indulgent corruption of Russian billionaires who control the country. And he uses these visual\ninvestigation techniques that are really stunning to\nlook at and really convincing. But there's also a good amount of snarky, poking fun in\nevery one of his videos like this deep dive into the corruption of\nthis Russian politician that starts with this goofy iPhone video of him awkwardly dancing at\nlike a wedding or something. (man speaking Russian) But it's not just all poking fun, these videos then go very deep and they reveal really useful\nand compelling evidence that shows just how bad this situation is, just how in bed the government is with these rich billionaires, but always peppered with\na good amount of this. (upbeat music) He's like a viral internet sensation meets like, hardcore, journalists,\nactivists, video vlogger guy, he's just an interesting character, so what is Navalny? He's kind of a politician,\nbut he's more than that. His specific policy agenda has more, and it's honestly like not that noble, like he totally supported\nthe annexation of Crimea which is like totally off limits and a terrible thing that happened. And his electability as a\nleader, isn't very likely but that's not really at\nthe heart of his mission. His mission isn't about being elected, it's about dismantling the current system, not to convince people to vote for him, but simply get people\nto vote against Putin and the status quo. And here's why this scares the (beep) out of Vladimir Putin. Back to our house of cards, even though Putin is at\nthe top of this pyramid, it doesn't mean he's all powerful. He's not like a standard\ntotalitarian dictator who just has everyone under his thumb. He's only powerful because\nhe's in the good graces of all these super rich guys that own the massive companies of gas, telecoms, mining the\nnatural resources in Russia. If these guys turn on him, he's over. Putin, while powerful is simply one cog in the machine of keeping\nthese guys powerful and immune from laws and regulation. Putin isn't afraid that all these YouTube\nvideos are going to create legal issues for Putin and his friends, the courts in Russia\nare just as influenced by this culture of\nbribery and intimidation as everything else, he's not afraid of that. Instead, he's afraid that\nthe people might realize that their government is controlled by a bunch of billionaires and start demanding that\nRussia be more transparent. (slow music playing) Some accountability for these rich dudes and the leaders that support them. And like I said, if that happens, these billionaires might be able to slip into the shadows and run away to some other country. But Putin will be the\npublic face of the person who's kept this arrangement together, he will be enemy number one, his fall will be the greatest that is why he's afraid. In a sense, he's painted\nhimself into a corner and he's past the point of no return. He must maintain the current system or he will face the wrath of his people. So far, the only person who has actually garnered that wrath is Alexei Navalny. - How corrupt do you think\nis Mr. Vladimir Putin? - He's the basement of this corruption, he's personally involved in corruption and he's encouraging our\nofficial for corruption. It's his wave of ruling country. - [Man] Vladimir Putin\nmade his first visit since Russia annexed Crimea- - Vladimir Putin cast his shadow across the boundary of Europe and Russia. - So Putin goes to greater\nand greater lengths to ensure that he remains\npopular among his people and show the billionaires that he's still the right guy to keep this system of corruption going. He does this in a few ways. The first way, he keeps popularity among his\npeople is my favorite, and it looks like this. (upbeat music) He stages these absurd photo ops where he's like surveying the land on a horse with no shirt, or playing hockey with a bunch of literal professional\nhockey players from Russia, and he's actually better than all of them, and he scores eight goals in the course of this video, it's amazing. (upbeat music) And people actually buy this, they like to see their\nleader like super powerful. And then secondly, he\nkeeps his people happy by actually leading the\ncountry in ways people like. His approval rating remains quite high. But more and more, as Putin and his house of\ncards feels threatened, Putin is resorting to more extreme means to keep this system secure. (man speaking Russian) Okay, so we got the backstory on Russia and Alexei Navalny, let's get back to Berlin, to the hospital, to the ICU where Alexei\nNavalny is in a coma. (slow music playing) He finally comes out of this coma, and by then, the world has\nlooked into the details of him being poisoned on this airplane, and it becomes clear that this is the work of Russian government agents who snuck into his hotel\nand laced his underwear with this lethal nerve poison. Alexei Navalny is big master\nof trolling and pranking, and he immediately responds to this. Did he download some basic\ncall spoofing software that any of us could download? And he masks his number as a number coming from an\nintelligence secure line, and he calls an intelligence agent who has COVID and is like ditched out in his house at 7:00 in the morning, and he's like delirious, and he goes on to pretend\nthat he is a leader and the intelligence agency has all this insider information, and he teases out a confession from this intelligence agent that indeed they were the ones behind this poisoning. (man speaking Russian) I'm not gonna play a bunch\nof that phone call here but I'm gonna put a\nlink in the description and you need to go listen to it because it is insane to listen to. So, what's Navalny's next move? He's in Berlin, he almost got killed, he's now having to learn to walk again because the nerve poison\nlike really f'd him up, what does he do? He decides to do exactly\nwhat he's always done. Instead of cower and stay abroad, he decides to return to Russia to face Putin head-on. Upon his return, he releases a documentary that is his most epic documentary yet, he was working on it\nbefore he got poisoned. This one focuses entirely on Putin and his network of bribes, cronyism, and loads of amazing drone footage of Putin's lavish palace on the Black Sea. In true Navalny fashion, he makes it clear that he's\ngoing to release the film after he returns to Moscow, because in his words, (Alexei speaking Russian) (upbeat music) The documentary becomes\none of the most instantly viral videos ever to appear\non the YouTube platform. It currently has 110 million views. My favorite part of this doc is when Navalny's team goes to\nthe shores of the Black Sea, they blow up this inflatable boat, and then they get a drone in the air and they fly over this giant palace on the shores of Black Sea. And then they do what I love, which is animation on top of drone footage to help expose a crazy story. They start to pick apart every aspect of this palace to get the original blueprints to show that there's a\nhockey rink in the basement, there's a full casino, and all of this for the benefit of the\npresident of the country. But of course, it's not\nowned by the president, it's owned by his buddies. Some rich billionaire\ndude actually owns it but who actually benefits from it? Putin. It's like a symbol of\nthe whole Russian system in one drone shot, it's\nfreaking beautiful. No political leader should\nhave a palace like this. - [Reporter] Alexei Navalny who returned to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last summer. - Navalny lands in\nMoscow, and what happens? He's immediately arrested. On what charges? Well, they claimed that\nhe was violating parole from some old fake set of charges brought against him years ago that were thrown out later, they were totally fake, and yet the Russian state continued to say that he\nhad to report for parole. Turns out he couldn't\nreport to parole offices because he was in a coma from being poisoned by\nthe Russian government, and yet he gets arrested. - [Reporter] He'd only been back on Russian soil a few minutes when Alexei Navalny was\ntold he was being detained, a kiss goodbye for his wife Yulia. - Russia's justice system has been a sham for a long time. This isn't new, but just\nhow blatant this is, how clearly faked all\nof this is to silence a threat to the leader, that's a new law for Russia\nand its justice system. (slow music plays) So Navalny is arrested and put on trial, the people take to the streets of Moscow and around the country. The police meet them with force arresting over a thousand protestors, and now arresting journalists. Here's a clip of Navalny's lawyer speaking openly to the media in the middle of Moscow, and out of nowhere, a group of policemen come detain her. (people murmuring) In broad daylight. While the protestors clashed with the police outside the courthouse, Navalny stands in a glasscage while a largely politically\nmotivated sham trial about parole violation takes place. His wife Yulia is in the\ncourtroom in the audience watching this all happen, they're making eye contact. And in the end, the system does what it's supposed to do, Navalny gets two years and\neight months of prison time. The house of cards stays stable for at least a little longer. (people protesting) This movement was never about Alexei Navalny or his politics, and it likely never will be, he will never be the leader of Russia. His role in all of this\nis focused on one thing, showing the people how\ntheir country really works, ripping away the curtain that veils how their government uses\nthe resources of the people and who it serves and who it doesn't. Doing so threatens the security of Vladimir Putin and his friends. Which is why the system is reacting, going to greater and greater lengths to muzzle Navalny and anyone like him. The question for me is,\nhow far will this go? How much is too much before the Russian people decide to take back their country? (slow music playing) (people protesting) (slow music playing) Thank you for watching this video, it is unfolding right now, and by the time you're watching this, there may be new information about this. I'm putting a bunch of\nlinks in the description for some of the videos that I mentioned that you should go watch if you want to learn more. I now want to thank today's sponsor which is a thing I have used forever, which is Audible. Audible is a place that\nused to just be audiobooks, and that's why I got into it like literally 10 years ago. Now, it is a place that has audiobooks but also tons of other audio\nspoken word, just content.

I will often listen to an audiobook while I'm working on a story so that I can get up to speed on the background of that story and become just more informed about the topics that I'm covering. The audiobook I'm listening to right now, well, I'm listening to a bunch actually but the one I'm really loving\nis called \"Fluent Forever.\" It is the psychology of language learning, I just did a language\nlearning class on bright trip and I'm like deep in the\nscience of language learning. It's an amazing listen,\nI'm learning a ton. I also have loads of\nItalian language audiobooks that I'm listening to. Like I'm listening to \"Hunger\nGames\" in Italian right now, it's really nice learning to punch. Anyway, because you are watching this before Presidents' Day here in the United States, you are gonna get in on\none of the biggest sales of the year that Audible does.

    "title": "GAMESTOP DRAMA, EXPLAINED (with Pok\u00e9mon cards)",
    "video_id": "gUWz6-ypQM0",
    "captions": "- [Woman] Internet trading mob is driving GameStop shares higher. - [Man] This GameStop\nsituation is the craziest I think I've ever seen. - What the hell is\nhappening with GameStop? - [Woman] Users of Reddit's\nwallstreetbets forum has helped bid that stock\nup massively this week. - [Mark Cuban] Some will make\nmoney, some will lose money, but that's just the way\nthe market's always worked. - My children are asleep\nand I am back here because I need to know\nwhat the hell is happening with GameStop and the stock\nmarket and short squeezes and all of this weird\nstuff that is happening on the Internet and the financial markets. So I am going to figure that out right now and you are gonna learn along with me. I think the first thing I need to do is buy stock in GameStop. That's the first thing I'm gonna do, 'cause I don't fully understand this but I feel like I need to be a part of it, so I'm gonna buy some\nshares and see what happens. - GameStop short sellers lost $1.6 billion in a single day as Reddit\ntraders rebelled against them. - So they decided, \"We're gonna\nfuck their whole system up\". - Just to boost GameStop's stock? - [Joe Rogan] Yes, well\njust to see if they could. - I'm deep in it right now. I've been on a call with my\nbuddy who's a finance guy. He is walking me through\nevery single thing. I've also spent an insane\namount of time on Investopedia. I'm getting this, I am understanding what the hell is happening\nhere and it is pretty cool. Okay, here's what happened. To understand this, you have\nto understand Pokemon cards. You don't, I mean, let me explain. There's this concept in\nfinance that is painfully hard to understand for us laymen outside of the black box of trading. You've heard it a million times, there's a whole movie\nabout it that I love, it's one of my favorite\nmovies of all time. - Somebody shorted 200\nmil of mortgage bonds? - [Man] That was just with Deutsche. Word is he had half the town. - How much in total? - 1.3 billion. - And yet, it's painfully\nhard to get your head around, but I think I've done it\nand I'm gonna break it down with an analogy. So let's say it's 2001 and\nPokemon cards are a thing but they're not that valuable yet, and you go to your little\nbrother and you say, \"Let me borrow one of your cards. \"Let me borrow it. \"I'll borrow it for one year, \"and I promise I will\ngive it back to you.\" And your brother's like,\n\"Okay, which one do you want?\" And you're like, \"I want Charizard.\" \"Okay, Charizard.\" It's a dragon card. Okay, so you get Charizard. I'm not a Pokemon guy,\nbut I know Charizard. You're borrowing this card\nfrom your brother for a year. It's not yours, but even still, you're able to go onto eBay and sell it. You sell it for $10, okay? So you just sold this\nCharizard card for $10. You just made $10, even though\nyou didn't spend any money buying that card. But in the back of your mind,\nyou know that you have to give a Charizard card back to your brother, you promised you would. A year goes by and you go back onto eBay and one of two things will\nhave happened by then. Remember you sold it for $10, but now a yer later, the\ncard could be worth $2. If it's worth $2 now, because\nit's not that cool anymore, you're pretty excited. You buy one off eBay, you\ngo back to your brother, and you're like, \"Here,\nhere's your Charizard card.\" Your brother doesn't care\nhow much you bought it for. You are making good on the deal\nby giving him back his card. You, on the other hand, are stoked because you borrowed that card for free, you went and sold it for $10, and then to replace it a\nyear later, it was only $2, so that $8 is yours. You got that out of nowhere. Now what would happen if\nit went the other way? You go onto eBay a year later to replace your brother's Charizard card,\nand the price is now $100, it's 10 times. Then you're like, \"Oh crap.\" You had sold it for\n$10, now it's worth 100. You have to cough up\n$90 of your own money, out of your own pocket, to pay for that to make good on your\npromise to return the card. This process happens every single day right up the road in New York City, where hedge funds, which are big giant aggregations of money that are managed by smart analysts who think about the\neconomy all day, take bets. But instead of Pokemon cards,\nyou can borrow someone's stock and go sell it, with the\npromise that you will return that stock to them at\nsome point in the future. If you have a suspicion\nthat Charizard cards are gonna be worth less\nmoney in the future, then you'll probably go\nto your little brother and do this deal. It makes a lot of sense,\nyou could make eight bucks if you know that Charizard\ncards are gonna be worth a lot less in the future. And this is what hedge funds do every single day in New York City. They look at companies that they think are gonna be worth less in the future and they go to the shareholders\nof the company and they say, \"Hey, let me borrow\nyour stock for a second. \"I'm gonna go sell it, \"and I promise I'll give it\nback to you in the future.\" But let's talk about\nGameStop for a second. GameStop is a video game store. I actually went to one last week, because we just got a Nintendo Switch. For the first time, we\nhave Nintendo in our home, I'm playing Zelda with my children. You ready to play Zelda? And I needed a controller,\nso I went to GameStop. This is the first time I've ever been inside of one of these places. GameStop is a retailer\nthat is usually in a mall, a place you probably haven't\nbeen in a very long time, and especially during COVID-19. A lot of people up in New York City, who spend their day thinking\nabout the future of companies and our economy, sort of saw GameStop as, \"Oh, they're doomed. \"These people are gonna be\nout of business in no time.\" Or in other words, \"Oh,\nthe Charizard card? \"That's gonna be worth nothing in a year. \"I'm gonna go to my little brother \"and see if I can borrow it from him \"so I can do a deal and make\neight bucks off of this.\" And if you look at the value\nof a share of GameStop stock during 2020, you would see the\nomen, this place is doomed. It was down at $4 a share, sometimes it would bump up a little bit. This was a cheap stock, but again, go back to\nour little scenario here. It's a year after you borrowed and sold your brother's Charizard\nPokemon card for $10. You pull up eBay, you search for the card and now it's worth $100 or $200 or $1000, and you start to panic. You have to buy that card\nand give it to your brother, you have to. Where the money comes\nfrom, that's up to you. This is exactly what happened\na couple of weeks ago. - [Woman] Look at the stock, it's up more than 680% so far this year. - Instead of this graph going\ndown, this graph went up. So now we understand this\nconcept of shorting a stock, that's what it's called. When you think a stock is gonna go down, you can take a short\nposition on that stock and you can get a payout if it goes down. - Do you smell that? What is that? - [Man] What? - What's that smell? - Cologne? - [Man] No. - Opportunity. - No, money. - Oh. - But here's where it gets\ninto unprecedented territory that gets at the heart\nof our financial system and what it even means. The reason the stock went up\nis because of a sub-Reddit. This sub-Reddit, wallstreetbets,\nis full of people who are sort of stock\nbros that didn't make it to Wall Street and decided to\nbecome trolls on the Internet. It's a bunch of dudes,\nmisogynistic as hell, who are crude, irreverent\nand foul-mouthed, but also incredibly good at trolling the hell out of hedge funds. These guys caught wind of the fact that all of these hedge\nfunds were shorting GameStop, that were basically betting\nthat it was gonna go down. They had borrowed and sold\na lot of Charizard cards, hoping that it would be worth a dollar. So they decided to rally around GameStop and they started buying stock,\ntons of it, all together. And when you buy a lot of stock\nand there's a lot of demand, the price goes up. - [Man] They realized that all of the institutional investors were hedging on GameStop, so they just bought a\nbunch of call options, bought a bunch of stock. - I'm not saying they're\nworking in concert, I'm not saying they're\ndoing anything illegal. I am saying that they are in force. - Soon this started to catch attention and people started to see\nthis rally around GameStop, this random, totally mediocre retailer, and yet it was rallying\nin the stock market. And so more and more people\nstarted buying the stock and the price kept going up, and the hedge funds started to panic. - Tuesday, the data's a little lagged, was the worst day for\nthis community on record. - 'Cause here's the thing\nabout the Charizard card, you borrowed it from your\nbrother and you sold it for $10. If you come back a year\nlater and it's worth $100 and you have to front\nthat $90 somehow to buy it and return it to your\nbrother, you're panicking. If it's worth $500, you're\npanicking a lot more. If it's worth $1000, you're\npanicking a lot more, and you can start to see where this goes. There's no ceiling. It can be worth $1000,\n$2000, $5000, $100,000. From 10 to 100,000, then what? There is no ceiling, there is\nno end to the amount of losses that you can take when you\nshort a position like this. - They are being very\nspecific to break the shorts. - So these hedge funds are looking at this graph just tick up. This stock that was worth $4 a share for the majority of this\nyear suddenly was worth 40, and then 60, and then 100, and then 200, and then 300 and 400, and then it hit an all time\nhigh of $469 per share, more than 100 times what\nit was during most of 2020. These hedge funds are dying, and meanwhile the stock bros\non Reddit are loving it. It's just this crazy moment of\nReddit versus the hedge funds that I never thought\nI'd see in my lifetime, and here we are. - Good evening, newly\nminted Reddit millionaires. I'm sure all of you are watching this from the marble bathtubs\non your hover craft. - So there's this one hedge\nfund in New York in particular called Melvin Capital. They are the most screwed out of everyone. They had borrowed a ton of Charizard cards and now had to pay them back. So just recently, like last week, Melvin Capital is in deep crisis. They're selling off all of\ntheir long-term positions, the things that they want\nto succeed in the long run, to cover this, and then they're going out and begging for money. And luckily, all these hedge fund people are really connected and\nthey all know each other and they're all buds, and\n$3 billion worth of capital just comes down from\nthe heavens like manna and keeps them afloat, barely. So Melvin Capital's freaking out, they get their $3 billion\nsavior fund that comes in and then today, the day I'm\nfilming this, it's Friday. You're probably watching\nthis on Monday, I don't know. Today, Robinhood, which\nis the app that allows you to trade really easily\nand is what probably a lot of these Reddit bros are using\nto make all of these trades, Robinhood freezes trading on GameStop and several other stocks that\nwere following in this trend of companies that were failing, that a lot of hedge funds had shorted on, and were now being rallied behind because of freaking Reddit. These are called meme stocks. They aren't being rallied\nbecause the company's doing well, they're being rallied as a\nsort of FU to hedge funds who have shorted their\nposition on these stocks. This is unprecedented\nfor a trading platform to just halt trading in the name of what? A lot of people are wondering,\nwhy did Robinhood stop this? Isn't this the free market? Well, remember Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that was most\nscrewed over by this situation? Melvin was rescued in the\nend, they didn't go under, in part with a lot of money from another fund called Citadel. Citadel is also a major\ncustomer of Robinhood, providing up to 35% of\ntheir revenue in some years, according to tax forms. - I want you to address the obvious. This looks like a move by\nan outfit called Robinhood, which is supposed to\nbe taking from the rich and giving to the poor, and\ndoing exactly the opposite, that when the big guys, including one of your main\ninvestors in your company started to lose, you shut down the game to starve the little guy. - Soon you have members of Congress calling for an investigation. - This is why we need an\nSCC that has clear rules about market manipulation. - And take a guess on what you think the guys on Reddit are gonna do. You think they're gonna\nback down and be like, \"Oh yeah, Robinhood\nstopped us from trading. \"We're probably gonna stop doing this\"? No no no no, ooh you just\npoured fuel on the fire. We don't have all the facts here, this is fresh and unfolding\nand soon we may know. But the fact is that there\nis a very tight-knit web among all of these financial\npeople in New York City that look out for one another, and when a mob of angry\nReddit people show up to completely screw up\ntheir system and their bets, it's not actually that surprising to think that they would band together and stop it. There'll probably be an\ninvestigation into this and if you're watching\nthis any time in the future beyond the next couple of weeks\nfrom when it was published, there will probably be\na lot more information and I can't wait to get my hands on it. Overall, this is a crazy\nthing that is happening, not only because it's\nan amazing spectacle, but because it helps reveal the craziness of our financial system. I'm not saying it's bad,\nI'm saying it's crazy, meaning it's literally mental. It is literally mass psychology. How we value something and\nthe price we put on it, whether it is a Pokemon\ncard or a share in GameStop, is 100% a result of how a group of people decide to act towards\nit, to think about it. That is how our entire\nfinancial system is modeled. Value is based on what a bunch\nof people think value is. Just like a dollar bill. A piece of paper is only valuable because we all sort of\nbelieve it's valuable. We all take this for granted,\nit's like the air we breathe. It's become totally status\nquo to think of value and economics and\nfinancials in these terms. And yet a moment like this,\nwhen it gets disrupted, when those forces disrupt the status quo, it starts to become a little bit crazy to think of it in these terms. It almost takes the\ncurtain away a little bit and shows us what our financial system really is built off of,\nwhich is mass psychology. So I bought some shares of GameStop and whether it wins or\nloses in the next few days, I'm just excited to be\na part of this ride. This is crazy. All right, that's it. There's no sponsor for today's video because I just made it really quickly. I guess I'll just make\na plug for my Patreon. Go follow me on Patreon,\nhelp support my videos, okay bye. (light music)"

    "title": "How China Became So Powerful",
    "video_id": "qw-FLc7Z01Q",
    "captions": "(lively electronic music) - Back in the old days, this part of the world used to be the economic superpower of the planet. There were dynasties that\ndiscovered everything from the compass, to printing, to making paper, to gunpowder. They would lead huge\nexpeditions around the globe. This was China, the Middle Kingdom, and right next door, India. This was the center of the\nglobal economic universe. But around the 1800s,\nthat started changing. (photos click) Over here, in Europe\nand the United States, there was a major revolution\nthat started taking place. Science, then machines, then weapons, trains, cars, flight, bombs, factories, cities, and\nwith their new power, these countries started to expand to take over large swathes of the map. China remained a great civilization, but as the west started showing up, knocking on China's door\nwith their big guns, China couldn't really\nmatch their firepower, and they had to concede land to Britain, which is how we got Hong Kong. The industrial revolution\ndidn't really happen in China the same way it did in the west, and by the middle of the 1800s, China began a massive decline in its economic standing in the world. A century later, that\nsituation got way worse as China was invaded\nby its neighbor, Japan. China's economy was no longer\nthe prosperous Middle Kingdom, but rather a shadow of itself, a poor country that was\nbeing occupied by outsiders. Once World War II was over, the west devised a new global\neconomic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the west, capitalism, free enterprise, still with some government oversight and high taxes for the\nrich and corporations, but it was still capitalism, and after the war, this\ncapitalism would go on to become a miracle for many countries, rebuilding Germany, France, Japan. For many in the west, post-World War II capitalism\nwas like a magic elixir that was fixing everything. It was working so well that more and more\npeople started to believe that we needed to get\ngovernment out of capitalism, and let the market just do its thing. One of the major advocates for this idea of unfettered capitalism was this guy. - There has never in history\nbeen a more effective machine for eliminating poverty than the free enterprise\nsystem and the free market. - A Chicago-based economist\nnamed Milton Friedman. - If they fail, they bear the cost. If they succeed, they get the benefit. - The idea at the core of this financial and economic system was that\ncompanies would get investment from people who owned\nshares in that company, we call this a corporation, and that the sole purpose\nof this corporation was to make money for these\nowners, or these shareholders. In Milton Friedman's own words, quote, \"The social responsibility \"of a business is to increase profits.\" That is the rule of a business. Increasing short term\ngains for shareholders would benefit all of society, according to this model. And if you look at the data, in the United States and the west, Milton Friedman sort of had a point. (horn honks) And it led to huge prosperity in the west, as the U.S. economy exploded. Wait a minute, but what about China? Aren't we talking about\nChina and its economy? You know, the Middle Kingdom, China. So, while the U.S. and\nwestern economies are thriving because of this corporate\nfree market capitalism that was taking over the world, China was descending further\nand further into decline. Instead of joining the capitalism party that the west was spreading throughout the world, China resisted, turning to a one-party-rule\ncommunist system, headed by this guy, Mao Zedong, who destroyed any chance of China's economy ever\njoining the prosperity happening around the world. By the 1970s, China was a\nplace of widespread poverty. The once prosperous kingdom\nhad reached rock bottom, but that was all about to change. (film projector clicks) So it's the 1970s, and this is China's new\nleader, Deng Xiaoping. He came into power hoping to turn around this 150 years of humiliation in China, the decline of China as a superpower. Elsewhere in the region, China's neighbors had economies that joined the global economic party that was happening in capitalism, and they were thriving. They saw immense economic miracles, and pulled millions out of poverty. Deng specifically went\non a visit to Singapore early on in his term where ethnic Chinese had\nadopted the free market, and they were thriving. He felt inspired. The Maoist economic doctrine that had failed was over, and it was time to see if China\ncould rebuild its economy, experimenting with some\nversion of capitalism. But he had to do this carefully so as not to disrupt the one-party rule that China had created, so he decided to just focus on one little village, a sleepy village in southern China of just around 30,000 people,\nright across the border from the British-controlled Hong Kong, which, at the time, was thriving because of its hardcore\ncapitalistic economy. Deng Xiaoping designated this little town as, quote, a special economic zone where foreign companies could set up and invest in a very\ncapitalistic free market. Hong Kong would sort of act as a bridge between western businesses\nand this little gateway into communist China. It was still socialism, but with some Chinese\ncapitalistic characteristics. What happens next is arguably the most mind-blowing economic miracle ever to have taken place on planet Earth. (lively electronic music) This little, sleepy village that was a special economic\nzone in China exploded from a little fishing village with little more than\na few thousand people and some rice paddies to a massive city of over 10 million people. The average income went from $1 a day to over $30,000 a year. This starts happening all over China, and meanwhile, Milton Friedman's back in the U.S., being like, (lively orchestral music) yep, told ya. Soon, there were a bunch of\ncities designated in China for special economic activity, or, basically, capitalism\nin a socialist country, and more and more foreign\ncompanies flocked to China for its cheap labor. It became the world's factory. China joined this trend\nof other Asian economies, and eventually passed them up to become the second\nlargest economy on earth. You can see this in a graph. This year, Asia will actually\npass the rest of the world in accounting for more\nthan 50% of global GDP. It is a massive economic transformation, and it explains why China\nhas become so powerful. Okay, but wait, this is a very wonderful\nstory about capitalism and its ability to lift millions\nof people out of poverty, and to industrialize a\ncountry seemingly overnight, but there's another side to this coin that we need to talk about. (paper rustles) I have two graphs I wanna show you. (paper rustles) They look like this. Okay, let's look at this one first. It's called the Elephant Graph. Do you sorta see why? (elephant trumpets) Let's deconstruct this graph, and try to understand what this says about the past 30 years\nof the rise of China. On this axis is everyone on\nearth ranked by their income, grouped into percentiles,\nso these people down here make an income that is\nthe 10th percentile, the lowest 10% in the world, and then the 20th percentile,\nand so on, and so on, up to these people up here who\nare the richest in the world. They have an income that puts\nthem in the 90th percentile. This axis here shows how much growth and income these people have had over the past 35 years, basically during the heyday\nof shareholder capitalism and the rise of China. So, you'll see how this\nplays out in just a second. Let's start plotting\nhow much income growth each of these groups saw\nover the past 35 years. The bottom 10% saw their incomes grow by around 75%, not bad. These are people who live\nin the poorest countries, who make the lowest income in the world. The 20-30% saw huge\ngrowth in their income, 125% and more over the past 35 years. This is like the new middle class in China and other Asian countries who saw huge income growth\ndue to globalization. They did really well under this system. But then, you start to get to the people in the 50th, and 60th, and 70th, and 80th percentile. This is basically people who live in the middle class in the west. Their incomes have grown much slower, sometimes under 50% over\nthe course of 35 years, which is little over 1% a year, not very much income growth, and some of these people in the west have seen their incomes shrink, like the blue collar workers in Detroit and the Rust Belt whose\njobs disappeared to China. So, so far, you can sort of\nsee why this makes sense. The people in China who benefited from this mass industrialization\nsaw huge benefits, and the people here in the United States and in the west who saw\njobs go overseas to China saw a way slower growth in their income. But watch what happens next, when we get to the groups of people who are at the 99 percentile, basically the richest 1% in the world, and for this, I actually\nhave to stretch out the graph to get us a little bit more granular. These are the people who have the highest incomes in the world. Let's see how their income has grown over the past 35 years. You can see that their income has exploded under this system. They're seeing tripling of their income in the past 35 years. Now, a reminder that\nthis is 35 years of data from every economy on earth. This shows everyone on the planet. So this gives us a view\nof who are the winners and the losers of this\nshareholder capitalism that has globalized to\nAsia and around the world. The top 1% of income earners saw the biggest benefits from this system. They are the ones who\ndisproportionately benefit from shareholder capitalism and the growth of globalization. (soft electric piano music) Okay, so that's my first graph. It's the Elephant Graph. It is a very useful way\nto see one of the results of this version of capitalism\nand the growth of China. The second graph looks like this. This shows the amount of\nCO2 emissions by country. You've got Europe and the United States, and then, up here, you've got China, the world's largest emitter of CO2. Like the Elephant Graph, this graph combines loads of data to show us that shareholder\ncapitalism focuses so much on short term profits for shareholders that it leaves out any consideration for how this economic activity\naffects the planet we live on and our ability to live on it. I know you've heard this message a bunch, and if you're like me, it is hard to not become sort of numb to this impending crisis that, we don't really\nknow what it looks like, and it feels like there's\nnothing we can do, but we have to do\neverything really quickly. But let me just reiterate in my own words that it is now a certain fact that our global climate is changing in such a way that it\nwill very likely lead to immense shifts on our earth, and our ability to live on our earth. It's already happening, it\nwill continue to happen, and all we can do now is maybe put on the brakes a little bit. Okay, let me just wrap this up, and give you my final thought on what this all means. I'm not showing you all these graphs because I'm just, like, a data nerd who loves to look at graphs, although I kind of am. Sorry. I'm showing you these graphs because the story of the rise of China is often a story of how\ncapitalism has pulled tens and hundreds of millions out of poverty, and it has, and that's amazing, but these graphs give us a view of what it has also\ndone, what this version of capitalism also\nincentivizes and results in. If we're going to consider the effects of this version of capitalism, we have to look at all of its effects, not just some of them. So, what's the solution? Is it socialism? No, it's not. It is simply a new version of capitalism, a reframing of how we think about business and globalization, one that old Milton\nFriedman would despise, and one that more and more businesses are actually realizing we must adopt. The solution isn't to scrap\ncapitalism altogether, but instead to expand it, to not just focus on shareholders and delivering them short term profits as quickly and as efficiently as possible, but to also focus on other people who are affected by the business. You can call these stakeholders. This is like the customers,\nand the suppliers, and the employees, and the government, and the overall economy, and the planet, and, of course, shareholders. This is called stakeholder capitalism, and it's basically just an acknowledgment that businesses that focus only on profits for shareholders don't end\nup benefiting everyone. There are winners and losers. It's not good for a huge\nswathe of the population, nor for the changing climate. Oh, and by the way, this isn't\nsome fringe liberal idea. Some of the biggest companies\nhere in the United States like Walmart, Apple, JPMorgan, have signed onto adopting\na new model of capitalism. This is changing, and in\nthe next five to 10 years, I believe we will see a new version of how businesses interact in the economy. So you're probably wondering, listen, I clicked on a video\nabout the rise of China, and we're ending here with\nstakeholder capitalism. The rise of China is\na story of capitalism, a certain version of capitalism. It's a story about how\ncapitalism can morph and change depending on what\neffects we want businesses to play in our society. If we want to produce\nthe most amount of wealth in the most efficient way, then the old shareholder model actually really works well for that, but if you want businesses\nto benefit everyone, including our children,\nand our grandchildren, and their ability to live on this planet, then our capitalism needs\nto pull in more priorities than just prophets for shareholders. - [Milton] What may be right for one stage in the development of an economy may not be right for another stage. - [Reporter] The so-called\ngreenhouse effect is created by carbon dioxide, a colorless, odorless gas. - So, I got to dig through a\nlot of data for this video, and I was able to partner\nwith the World Economic Forum, which is a think tank that I respect. They actually pioneered this idea of stakeholder capitalism decades ago, well before Apple and Walmart realized that it was a good idea. The head of the World Economic Forum just launched a book called literally \"Stakeholder Capitalism.\" It's an in-depth look at not only the rise of Asia and China, but also other major trends that help us understand the need to upgrade our capitalism. The book is really good. It's packed with useful\ninformation and graphics. It's easy to read and to comprehend. I'm gonna put a link in the description where you can learn more. It is available for you to purchase now if you want to get a deeper look into the future of our economy. Thank you, World Economic Forum, for partnering with me on this video. The Davos Summit happened this week, and I'm really glad that I was able to be a part of it. So, hope you're all doing well, having a good year so far, 2021. There's a new president down the road, and it's kind of exciting. And I'll see you in the next one."

    "title": "How The US Stole Iraq",
    "video_id": "C8YlGkoYXXM",
    "captions": "- Why did the US go to war in Iraq? - [Man] In the early\nstages of evacuations. - Growing up, the\nnarrative was always oil. We went to Iraq to get oil,\nlike America always does. - We might find ourselves without adequate supplies\nof energy in the future. - [Reporter] All major\noil fields in the south are now under coaliltion control. - But that's kind of the lazy explanation, it's not quite it. Oil is a part of it but\nit's not the main reason. We went to war in Iraq because several powerful\nAmerican men wanted to. Some of them thought it\nwas vital, we had to. Others just wanted to\nproject American power. But either way, here\nwe are 18 years later, nearly 10,000 Americans dead, over 200,000 Iraqis dead, over a trillion tax dollars spent. And the result? A Middle East that is\nless stable than ever in part because of the US presence and really because of it. How did this happen? I mean, I grew up and lived through this. I studied it as an undergrad, I studied it in grad school, and yet it's taken me until\nnow to really take a hard look and to really understand\nexactly what happened. So this is how the US stole Iraq. - [Man] Saddam Hussein\nis a tyrant, a murderer, and a man who has started two wars. He's clearly someone who\ncannot be trusted or believed. - All right, so it's the night of 9/11, the country is reeling. Who did this terrible thing and why? How should the US respond? And it became clear very soon amongst intelligence and\ncounter-terrorism people that al-Qaeda was behind it, this terrorist group that was\nmainly based in Afghanistan. Later that night, the night of 9/11, over at the Pentagon, which earlier that day had\nbeen hit by an airplane, a memo comes in from the\nDeputy Secretary of State. The memo is urgent. It's for the Defense Intelligence Agency, the people who've spent their time doing all the intelligence for war and other defense purposes. And this memo tells\nthe intelligence agents not to look into al-Qaeda, the people they know did it, but instead to look into ways Iraq has been involved in\nterrorism for the previous decade. The intelligence agents who got this memo sort of scratched their\nhead and were like, \"Wait what? What's going on here?\" These people were very\nfamiliar with the intel and they knew that this attack had come from al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is more than 1,000\nkilometers away from Iraq. It is a completely different place, they speak a different language, has nothing to do with Iraq. Afghanistan and Iraq\nare totally different. We had just been attacked by al-Qaeda, and yet the Deputy Secretary of Defense is asking for information about Iraq and its ties to terrorism. The person who sent this memo was the Deputy Secretary\nof State Paul Wolfowitz, and he was just getting started. (gentle music) A few days after 9/11, the president gathers\nall of his top advisors out at his forest retreat right\noutside of Washington, DC. They were there to discuss how\nto respond to these attacks. The focus of this discussion\nwas, of course, Afghanistan. How do we retaliate against al-Qaeda, this terrorist group that has been given sort of a safe haven by the\ngovernment of Afghanistan? So they're sitting in some\nconference room in some lodge in this forest retreat debating how they're gonna\nretaliate against al-Qaeda, and who pipes up again but\nthis guy, Paul Wolfowitz? This time with the support of his boss, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. So Wolfowitz pipes up and he's like, \"You know, 9/11 was a\npretty sophisticated attack. \"There's no way that this\nragtag terror group of al-Qaeda \"could have pulled it off all alone. \"They probably had help\nfrom Saddam in Iraq.\" And then Wolfowitz says that \"when it comes to global terrorism, \"Saddam is actually\nthe head of the snake.\" He actually said that, basically saying that Saddam\nis behind all of this. And everyone in the room is sort of like, \"Um, what the hell is\nthis guy talking about? \"Saddam Hussein is a really bad guy, \"but he's not the head of the snake \"of international terrorism.\" All these people, these very informed international\nadvisors. (chuckles) Oh man, after some astonished glances, the head of the Counterterrorism Center raises his hands and says, \"Mr. President,\" quote, \"we were attacked on\n9/11 by Osama Bin Laden \"and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. \"Saddam Hussein and Iraq has\nnothing to do with this.\" It's just like, I'm sorry, I feel like as an eighth\ngrader at this time I was asking these questions. I was like, \"Is Iraq the\nsame as Afghanistan?\" And here are the leaders of\nour country having to explain that Saddam Hussein has nothing to do with Afghanistan and al-Qaeda. So this meeting at Camp David, they move on and they keep\ntalking about these plans to bomb al-Qaeda. But Paul Wolfowitz is stubborn\nand he does not give up. Later that day there's a\nbreak in all of the meetings, it's like the afternoon. Attorney General John\nAshcroft is playing the piano in this sort of lobby and a few others are singing along these piano spirituals that he's playing. Condoleezza Rice is one of\nthese people singing along. President Bush is\nsitting over by the fire. It's this rustic cabin, it's all cozy. He's drinking a cup of coffee. And who cozies up to him at\nthe fire but Paul Wolfowitz? And Bush is like, \"Uh, here we go again.\" So he's like, \"Listen, check out my plan. \"Half of Iraq's people\nlive either way up here \"where they don't like Saddam. \"They're Kurds, they've\nbeen brutalized by Saddam, \"they do not like him. \"Or they live way down here in the south \"which is right near the border\nof our good friend Kuwait. \"We could easily come into Iraq \"and take both of these\nbig population centers. \"Oh, and in doing so,\"\nsays Paul Wolfowitz, \"we could naturally take the\nmajor oil fields in Iraq, \"thus cutting off Saddam from\nhis main revenue source.\" Or, in other words, he said making Saddam, quote,\n\"the Mayor of Baghdad.\" He would only have power in Baghdad, he would be cut off from the\nnorth and south of his country. In this moment I can almost\nsee George Bush's ears literally perking up when\nhe hears this last part about cutting off the oil supply. After all, Bush was a former Texas oilman and he knew the importance\nof having access to oil. So this plan sort of intrigued Bush and he literally said to\nPaul Wolfowitz, quote, \"Why didn't you bring\nthis up in the meeting?\" And Wolfowitz is like, \"Well, I didn't wanna step\non the toes of my superiors.\" Wolfowitz, we know you just wanted to cozy up against the president and plant this seed of how it\nwould be to take over Iraq. (gentle music) So put yourself in George\nBush's shoes for a second. Your country was just brutally\nattacked on your watch, and you are completely\nat a loss of what to do. There's no clear easy\ntarget to retaliate against. After a day of meetings, of sitting around trying to\nfigure out how to retaliate, George Bush is realizing that retaliating against\na tiny group of terrorists living in caves in Afghanistan is like trying to hit\nsmoke with a baseball bat. Kind of impossible. What George Bush wanted\nand felt like he needed, and it turns out what a lot of American\nlawmakers also wanted, was a clear decisive target. Not to try to hit smoke\nwith a baseball bat, but a nice solid hit. A home run. So I believe this day at Camp David, four days after 9/11, is when President Bush decided that he would find a way to invade Iraq, to make Americans and himself feel like he was actually doing\nsomething definitive, like toppling dictators, as a rebuttal to the\nterrible attacks of 9/11. Even though Iraq had\nnothing to do with al-Qaeda, he and his people around\nhim would find a way to make a connection. (gentle music) - If they're harboring terrorists, why not go in and get them? - Well, the evidence is pretty conclusive that the Iraqis have\nindeed harbored terrorists. - So, over the next year, this seed that Paul Wolfowitz\nreally planted and nourished in George Bush's mind starts to spread to everyone around him, and they start to find a way\nto sell the American public on this idea of war with Iraq. They get the British on board and soon there's a full-blown debate which revolves around this story that Saddam has really\nbig terrible weapons and that he will likely give\nthose weapons to terrorists who will strike the United States in another 9/11-type attack but way worse. - The debate about the war\nagainst Iraq has divided many along the political spectrum. - Hundreds of millions of dollars and I think that that is unnecessary. - Real concern about this Russian war. - And Bush kept saying\nweapons of mass destruction over and over again. He learned that short phrase. - Very dangerous weapons\nof mass destruction into this country. - But wait, hold on a\nsecond, don't be fooled. The lead-up to the Iraq\nWar is often remembered as this robust debate about WMDs, weapons of mass destruction. - Saddam Hussein will continue\nto increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to\ndevelop nuclear weapons. - But I'm here to tell you that you need to think\ndifferently about it. The decision to go to war\nin Iraq was already made. It was made moments after 9/11 when a small group of powerful men imagined a glorious military campaign to liberate oppressed\nIraqis and topple a dictator to make themselves and their country feel like we got a home\nrun after we were attacked. From there, everything\nmolded to fit that decision. Did Saddam Hussein have\nweapons of mass destruction? Did he wanna give those to terrorists? No, there was no evidence. The little evidence there was was threadbare and super speculative. But these guys turned into\nsort of like tea-leaf readers where you can look at the tea leaves and see whatever you need to to support the decision that\nthey made many months earlier. And it wasn't just these guys. Soon, this vision of toppling Saddam and having this American victory spread to the American Congress, Republicans and Democrats who\nwere also getting on board with this idea of\nAmerica, a force for good, toppling the bad guy. It's a really wild study\nin human psychology. When you're a true believer in something, you really really believe\nthat you need to do something. Everything you see confirms\nwhat you want to believe or what you need to believe. We all do it, but it's just scary when\nour leaders are doing this, and they're doing it on\nbeliefs and decisions that have deep ramifications\nfor human suffering. So yeah, you can go over the\ndebates and the intelligence and the back and forth on whether or not Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. It was all a show to\nhelp these people confirm what they'd already\ndecided they wanted to do. So by the end, after weapons inspectors\nhad done 700 inspections and found no weapons, this group of guys eventually\njust start resorting to full-on lying. Dick Cheney gets up in\nhis speech and says. - Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has\nweapons of mass destruction. - Well, there was plenty of doubt. In fact, he simply stated, there can be no evidence\nthat Saddam has WMDs was the reality at the time. Even the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, who was totally against\nthis fantasy-filled vision of going and invading Iraq, even him eventually got on board, painstakingly getting in front of the UN and going over a bunch of\nthin or non-existent evidence and claiming that it was watertight. - My colleagues, every\nstatement that I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we're giving you\nare facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. - Solid intelligence, no no no no. These are words that Colin\nPowell has lived to regret for the rest of his life. A lot of people saw Colin Powell as the one sane guy in the room. And so here at the UN when he's drinking the Kool-Aid and backing this intelligence, a lot of people got on board. By October 10th, 2002, the US Congress was fully on board. Almost all the Republicans in the chamber as well as a sizeable group of Democrats voted to authorize the US\nto use force against Iraq. - [Man] Senate Joint Resolution 45 to authorize the use of\nUnited States Armed Forces against Iraq. - He has said he wants the\npower to be able to go to war. This seems completely\nconsistent with that request that we say, \"Yes, Mr. President, \"you have that power to go to war.\" - This resolution gives the\npresident the authority he needs to confront the threat posed by Iraq. - Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. - And then it happened. - [Reporter] Sirens went off in Baghdad just a few minutes ago. An air raid is in progress over Baghdad. - Explosions in Baghdad. - [Bush] Our nation enters\nthis conflict reluctantly. - [Reporter] You could have a report that an estimated 30 Iraqis\nsurrendered at the border. (dramatic music) (jet whooshes) (triumphal music) - Two months after the invasion, George Bush gives a speech\non an aircraft carrier with this giant sign that says, quote, \"Mission accomplished.\" This is the type of thing\nBush surely was dreaming about while he was sitting by\nthe fire at Camp David, drinking coffee, listening to Paul\nWolfowitz explain the plan to take over Iraq. Big triumphant America\njust toppled the dictator. Mission accomplished. But this is the part of the story when all of the dreams, the fantasies, the visions of glory start to topple. Mission accomplished was\nreally mission just beginning. (gentle music) One of the first things that the US did when they took over Baghdad was they dissolved the\nhuge Iraqi military. They just said, \"No, we\ndon't want you anymore. \"All of you commanders and\nleaders, soldiers, you're out. \"We're gonna start fresh.\" In typical simplistic thinking\nof these visionary leaders, the idea was that doing\nso would allow them to start totally fresh with a new army, completely rid of any sort of\ninfluence of Saddam Hussein. So now you have a bunch\nof ex-Iraqi army members who are angry at the United\nStates and unemployed. Oh, and all of them have\nextensive military experience. - There is a large number\nof former Iraqi soldiers that are unemployed now. That is a huge concern. - It is just painful. What a terrible decision. So these guys run off\nand they start to join the growing number of\nrebel groups that are there cropping up to oppose the\nUnited States presence. One of those groups is\ncalled al-Qaeda in Iraq, which later turns into\nthe Islamic State of Iraq, which eventually becomes the Islamic State of\nIraq and Syria, or ISIS. A well-oiled governmental\nand military organization run by many of the military leaders who were ousted by the Americans\nfrom the Iraqi military when they took over Baghdad. So Iraq turns into the US trying to fight this growing rebellion. Billions of dollars turns into\ntens of billions of dollars, and then hundreds of billions of dollars, and eventually crossing over\ninto over a trillion dollars of tax payer money to fight this unnecessary war. Saddam Hussein was a really bad guy. He committed mass genocide against his own people, the Kurds. He executed many others,\nimprisoned many others. (man speaking in foreign language) - All in all, the number of dead on\nSaddam Hussein's hands numbers around 250,000 according to Human Rights Watch. That was over 25 years\nof his brutal regime. And yet in just eight years of this war that the US started in Iraq, way more people were killed. A power vacuum was opened up\nthat allowed ISIS to thrive, and for what? Why did we do this? How was this worth it? I really believe that in the aftermath of those towers falling, this group of guys began constructing a story for themselves. A fantasy, one not grounded in\nreal facts from intelligence, but one grounded in fear and\nin desire to be the hero, in the messianic complex that\nalways infects the powerful. That fantasy trickled down and spread to other people in power, leading us into one of\nthe most catastrophic and unnecessary wars in modern history. (gentle music) - I challenge the president or whoever has us here for 15 months to ride alongside me. I'll do another 15 months\nif he comes out here and rides along with me\nevery day for 15 months. - Oof, Saddam Hussein,\nGeorge Bush, Paul Wolfowitz. What a story, what a story. Yeah, anyway. I wanna thank the sponsor of\nthe video today, ExpressVPN, which is a service I've used for years. When I traveled, I would\nuse it all the time to basically route my connection\nthrough the United States so I could not be kicked out of my Gmail. I don't travel very much anymore so I use ExpressVPN these\ndays to watch Netflix, specifically Canadian Netflix. So basically with ExpressVPN it's not only a security measure that helps you secure your\nconnection with encryption and all of this great technology. The reason I like it so much is because I can route my connection through other countries, and then Netflix thinks\nI'm in the UK or in Canada and I can watch UK and Canadian stuff that isn't available on\nNetflix in the United States. This is actually the case with a lot of different steaming services. I love ExpressVPN. It's super easy. It's in the menu bar of my computer and all I have to do is click\nit and decide the country and boom I'm there within a few seconds. Oh, and the best part is you\ncan get three months of this literally for free if you use\nthe link in my description. It's expressvpn.com/johnnyharris. When you click that link, it helps support this channel but it also gives you three months literally free, zero money to use this. Thank you ExpressVPN for\nsupporting this channel and thank you all for watching. If you want more Middle East\ncontent, there is endless. It's what I studied in my undergrad, it was Middle Eastern politics, and there's just a lot. So I'm gonna get there, I'm gonna get to the rest\nof them if you all want it 'cause there is endless\nvideos I could make for the Middle East. Anyway, have a good day, see you."

    "title": "7 things I\u2019ve learned about journalism in 7 years of being a journalist",
    "video_id": "Rr7povAInwQ",
    "captions": "- Hi, everyone. Happy New Year, happy 2021.\n(gentle music) Sitting here in Washington, DC, right outside of what is\nincreasingly becoming a war zone, because this week there is a, hopefully, peaceful transfer of power\nfrom one leader to another. Anyway, let's talk about journalism. I sort of stumbled into journalism. At first I wanted to be like\na cinematographer, filmmaker. Then I wanted to be a\ndiplomat and I wanted to join the Foreign Service\nfor the United States. Then I learned that I didn't\nwanna do either of those things and that I could actually\ncombine ingredients from both to do this thing called journalism, communicating kind of complex topics of the day to an audience. I didn't go to journalism school, I didn't formally study this, but I ended up becoming what\nmost would call a journalist. Over the years I've learned a few things about journalism that I wanna share with you. - [Narrator] I assign a reporter to get all the important facts\nand to write the story. I also assign a news\nphotographer to take pictures. The recorder and photographer\nwill work together as a team. Now the reporter has all the facts. He's ready to write his story. He puts the most important facts\nin the first few sentences. Then he adds the interesting details. - So let's make a list here.\n(bright music) Number 1: \"Objectivity is a myth.\" There's no such thing as objectivity. I often find myself in these conversations where people are just like, \"If there was just\nunbiased, objective news, all of our problems in the\nmedia would just go away.\" That's a really attractive\nidea, but the more I do this, the more I realize that\nobjectivity isn't a thing, it's a theory. It's not a real thing\nyou can ever achieve. Every article you read,\nevery video you watch, every photo you see was\nproduced by a human being who went out and gathered that information and then decided what\nfacts to put down on paper. They chose to frame the\nissue a certain way, to leave out some stuff\nand to include other stuff. There were choices there. And those choices were the product of a human and their biases. Even a photo journalist, someone who takes pictures for newspapers, presumably the least bias type\nof journalism there can be, is still totally subject to bias. The way that photo is cropped and framed, and who they decided to take\na photo of, and at what time, and how they decided to expose the frame, all of those are choices. Objectivity is a myth. But what isn't a myth, and what's real? And I think what people\nare sort of getting at when they talk about\nobjectivity, is fairness. Being fair to your topic, or your subject, or the other side of the argument that you're making in your article. My old boss Ezra Klein\n(gentle music) used to talk about this\nconcept as generosity. We, as journalists go out and gather a bunch of information\nand facts about a thing, and then we sort of land somewhere on what we think about that topic. And our journalism, our story, is gonna reflect that decision. But what you can do as a fair journalist is you could be generous\nto the other side. You can present the best version of the other side's argument. That to me is what healthy journalism has, is generosity to the other side. But objectivity, it just doesn't exist. I experienced this in the\nfirst season of \"Borders\" when I was in Japan doing\nthat North Korea bubble story. I clearly had a position in that story, but at the same time, I wanted\nto give the best version, the most generous version, of\nthe North Korean viewpoint. And I tried to split that balance while also being clear and\nassertive about the facts. That's a difficult balance,\nbut when it's done right, it makes for better journalism. Number 2: \"A lot of journalists write for their peers and\nnot for their audience.\" This is another really\n(gentle music) useful thing that I learned\nfrom Ezra Working at \"Vox.\" A lot of journalism is hard to understand, that's just a fact. Like even now when I read\nthe \"Wall Street Journal\" or the \"Washington Post\"\nor the \"New York Times,\" I have a hard time getting\naround some of the language and some of the things that are happening, especially for topics\nthat I'm sort of new to. I've always felt this. And it's always sort of been\nfrustrating, 'cause I'm like, \"Aren't you guys writing\nso that I understand? Like, I'm an educated\nconsumer of this news and yet I'm having a\nhard time understanding.\" Like, that's a problem. A lot of journalism is\nwritten for insiders. People who are already kind\nof familiar with the topic. As a journalist, when you're writing about\nsomething that's kind of complex, you start to sort of get in your head. You're like, \"Man, a lot of\npeople are gonna see this. And a lot of really smart\npeople are gonna see this. So if I use really simple language, what are my peers gonna think? What are my journalists\nfriends down the road at the \"Washington Post\"\nor the \"New York Times\" gonna think about this article if I don't use all the fancy jargon?\" If I'm explaining the\nfinancial crisis in Venezuela, it's a lot more tempting\nto write something like, \"Hyperinflation has led to\nthe complete devaluation of the local currencies\nspurring a collapse in wages,\" which shows my peers that\nI'm actually really smart. I have a Master's degree in International Relations and Economics. But what about my audience who knows nothing about hyperinflation? They're left feeling left\nout and no more informed about the financial crisis in Venezuela. Instead, what I should do\nis write something like, quote, \"Situation has\ngotten so bad in Venezuela that the money is worth\na thousand times less than it was last year, making those who were once really rich now struggling to find their next meal.\" It's still accurate. It's still smart. And it's still an accurate assertion about what's happening in Venezuela. I'm just not using any of the jargon. If my peers judge me for that, so be it. At least my audience will understand. Number 3: \"Journalism has a lot of very old customs or traditions.\" There are a lot of old practices\nand habits in journalism that feel like gospel to a\nlot of people in journalism. One of the big ones that I always run into is that in sort of traditional\nconventional journalism we don't say the word \"I.\"\n(light music) The journalist is a fly on the wall, we're not there to insert ourselves, our personal character into the story, therefore we don't say the word, \"I.\" And I sort of understand\nthe thinking behind that even if I don't practice it. The other convention or custom, mainly in like documentary\nand video journalism, is that we're not here to make\nthings look too beautiful. Beautiful B-roll, evocative music, beautiful motion graphics, those are for like the brands\nand the corporate people. Here in journalism we care about \"The story\".\n(drums boom) And all the fancy stuff is just\nfluff, not necessary at all. I disagree with both of those. I disagree with the aversion to using \"I,\" and I disagree with the aversion to using beautiful imagery and B-roll and music. Luckily, when I came into journalism, I came into an organization\nthat was very eager to disrupt this old set\nof customs in journalism. \"Vox\" really encouraged me to experiment. Thank goodness they did. I was able to start a\nseries that was all about showing beautiful visuals\nof places around the world, and it had music and\nit had motion graphics. And of course, it had a lot of\nturning the camera on myself and talking to the camera. I was a character in the story, and I would go to these conferences, these journalism conferences, and I would always get\nsort of interrogated by these legacy news people who were like, \"Can you really consider this journalism?\" And my response was always, \"I don't know. Like, you can decide, I'm not here to chase\nthe label of journalism. I'm here to tell stories about people and to bring big audiences\nto those stories.\" The reality is a lot of these customs are sort of arbitrary\nand they were developed at a different time when\ninformation was shared differently. Let me caveat just one big thing here by saying that a lot of these norms, and a lot of these customs\nand ethics within journalism, are actually really useful. The idea of staying honest and fact-based, and accurate, and making\nsure that your assertions actually have some evidence to them, I am all for that. I love that there is a\nvery strong tradition and burden of evidence\nwithin journalism that says, \"If you can't prove it, it's not real,\" especially because a lot of those customs, which I believe are the\nreally important customs of factual information, are\nsort of going out the window. And if you need proof of that, just go five miles away\nfrom me to the Capitol, like a week ago, and see how that was covered\nby journalists on both sides. When it comes to the formats, the, \"Oh, that guy turned\nthe camera on himself\" or, \"Did a bunch of drone shots and therefore it's not journalism.\" I'm here to tell stories that have facts, and data, and characters\nand help inform people. If you decide to call\nthat journalism or not, I don't really care. It's how I do it. But I guess the lesson here is that if you're going into journalism, those are really serious intense customs that you will come in contact with. Which gets me to my next\nlesson which is number 4: \"Journalism school isn't\nalways the best way to get into journalism.\" Now, let me just pause for a second and make it clear that I am not saying don't go to journalism school. Most of the people who\nhave taught me what I know about the craft of journalism\nwent to journalism school and I am deeply grateful. Thank you, Joss Fong and others for teaching me how to do journalism when I frankly didn't\nknow what I was doing when I walked in the door,\nthe first day at \"Vox\". But, let me make it clear\n(bright music) that going to journalism\nschool is not the only or even the best way\nto get into journalism. Man, I've said journalism,\nthe word journalism, so many times in this video it's starting to get\nto the point where like the word feels weird to say,\nbecause I've said it so much. So anyway, my critique\nof journalism school is the same critique\nI have of film school, which is something I started and stopped after about a year and a half. The critique for both of these is that the institution spends so\nmuch time focusing on theory, tradition, history, critique\nof the old style of doing it, the old way of doing filmmaking, or the old way of doing journalism, that they don't give\nthe students much chance to actually experiment and play around with like, the new versions of\nhow this thing is being done. We spend so much time looking\nback and talking to faculty who sort of had their heyday\nin, like, the old days, that they don't spend a lot of time doing the type of journalism\nthat happens today, which is under very\ndifferent circumstances economically, politically, et cetera. So, my big critique is that there isn't enough, in the trenches, experience with journalism, and that you ended up getting a sort of warped version of what\nyou're gonna be doing, and a lot of fixed ideas that\nare hard to, sort of shift, when you actually get\nout into the real world. Now, there are a lot of journalism schools who are doing really great\nwork in this department and letting their students\nsee what it's really like. I go and speak to a lot of\nthese journalism schools, whether it's the University of Oregon, or Stanford, or Yale or whatever it is. When I speak to students at these schools I see an appetite from\nfaculty to give these students perspective on what\njournalism looks like in 2021. What it looks like in this\nnew age of digital journalism, and what are the different versions of journalism that one can go into? The big strength of journalism school is that they teach you the\nimportance of reporting, I mean, going out and gathering facts, of fairness, of facts,\nof accuracy, of evidence, the heart of journalism you\nlearn in journalism school. Absolutely. That is totally irrefutable. I believe in that, but I believe that you\nget a lot of that fluff on top of the customs and, how you're supposed to do journalism, and what is and what isn't. And those fixed ideas,\nif they root too deeply can hinder you once you\nget out into the field. Go there, learn, like, go for it, but make sure you don't get too entrenched on what journalism is and isn't. The next lesson is that: \"Journalism is economic\nin its very nature.\" It has to be, it is a business. Just watched \"Little Women\"\n(bright music) the new one with Hermione,\nit was really good. I watched \"Little Women\"\na bunch growing up but I'd never really bought it. And then I watched this one\nand it totally made sense. And I loved it. Anyway, there's this amazing\nline in there where she says, - \"So don't sit there\nand tell me that marriage isn't an economic\nproposition because it is.\" - Journalism is an economic proposition, meaning if you're starting\na journalism outlet in the United States, you\nare doing so as a business. You need to keep your lights\non and your doors open by selling something,\nwhether it's subscriptions, or whether it's ad's or whether\nit's some other new version of economic value that you can\ncreate with your journalism. You have to do that. And with that comes a certain set of expectations and incentives\nthat aren't necessarily aligned with the incentives of\ntelling really good stories. And now of course, I've ranted about this in\na previous video called, \"Why I hate the news.\" I'm not gonna go into the\ndepths of my thoughts on this. If you want to go watch\nthat video, you should. But, whenever I go to speak at a journalism conference in Europe, I always chat with them about\nthe economics of journalism in Switzerland or the\nNetherlands or whatever. And in Europe they've\nreally realized that like, private media can get out of control and can lead to some really bad outcomes. And so, they really try to buffer the media machine from private interests, and they do so, and a pretty good job, there's still private media in Europe. But here in the United States, private media is the name of the game. And the effects of these\nincentives on journalism are very apparent. We are incentivized to chase\nvolume, to chasing numbers, to chase like a little bit of what's gonna get people to click? It's hard to compete when\nthe information landscape incentivizes us to be in that environment. Money usually comes from\nattention and advertising not necessarily subscribers who pay a monthly fee for your newspaper. And attention and traffic are not always conducive\nto telling the best story or doing the best journalism, which is a real travesty. The best thing that took the most time, the biggest article that\nhas the most information, is not actually the most valued\namong the attention economy. But, anyway, I'm not here to lament human psychology.\n(muted cheers) I do offer two pieces of hope to this capitalistic incentive\nof the media quandary. Number one is that there are still really great outlets that publish really in-depth media and that you just have to pay money to. And by doing so you\nshield the need for them to have to just chase pure volume. One of my favorite outlets of all time and where I get most of my news and my ways of thinking about the world, is a British weekly magazine\ncalled \"The Economist.\" And I pay for it. I like to consume media\nthat I know was crafted by the incentives of serving\nme, the paying customer, as opposed to serving a different master, which is an advertiser\nwho will keep them afloat. There's still a lot of amazing media that happens through advertiser\nrevenue, but just as a fact, most media had to pivot to that, but, more and more, those\nincentives are pushing media into more sensationalized,\npolarized places. Okay, my second\n(bright music) piece of hope here is that when I joined \"Vox\", we were\njust sort of taking off. We had less than 100,000\nsubscribers on YouTube. It was like the early days. And there was this hypothesis\namong the whole organization, which was like a few dozen people, that if we could tell really good stories, and explain really\ncomplicated things to people, that we would actually win the views game, like, people would actually come to us instead of the funny cat video, because they actually want to understand. People actually want to\nengage with good information. And it turns out that that\nhypothesis was totally correct. The most popular videos\nI ever made at \"Vox\", one, a six minute explainer of\na complex Middle Eastern war, really complicated, but got\nhundreds of millions of views. And another really popular video I made was a 10 minute video explaining the housing policy crisis\nand tax law in Hong Kong. Like, some of those boring\nbut important information you could ever think of. But, because they were presented in a way that people could access, it actually made them really popular. And people said, \"Yes,\nI want to understand what's going on with the Syrian civil war, because everyone's talking about it and I don't understand it. I will sit through this six minute video.\" And that video by the way, took off, not on YouTube, but on Facebook. Like, the place where people's attention is apparently the lowest and\nwhere people are just there to click on whatever's sensational. That's a problem, that's happening, but you can still get people\nto watch really in-depth stuff if it's well told and well presented. So that, that's a hopeful\nthing to my little lament about the economics of journalism. Man, I'm getting deep right now. I'm getting like deep into\nmy theories of journalism. Yeah. Yeah. This is good. This is good. Let's get onto the next lesson. Number 6: \"Good writing\nis rare and beautiful.\" What I've learned in journalism is that the difference between someone really connecting with a story and not connecting with a\nstory, is just a few words. Good writing, whether it's for a video or a text-based article, it\ncan bring you into a story. It can illuminate a topic,\nit can humanize a character. It's really important. I wasn't very good at writing\nwhen I started at \"Vox\". And over the years I had some\nreally good story editors who would look at my writing and help me reshape it and simplify it, and make it more concise\nand make it clearer. I am grateful for the people\nwho taught me how to write, because, a lot of the videos\nyou see on this channel, yeah, there is beautiful maps,\nand there's fancy footage, and there's lots of\ndrone shots and whatever. But at the end of the\nday, behind all of that, the reason why you're interested\nin watching those videos is because I put a major\npriority on writing. I spent so much time choosing my words so that every story I tell\n(bright music) sinks in on the other\nside when you're listening and that's because good journalism is good writing at the end of the day. And it's incredibly important. If you want to get better at\nwriting, I have a book for you. I'm gonna put the link in the description. If I forget to do that,\ncall me out in the comments because I don't wanna forget because I wanna tell you about this book. I mean, I could just say it right now and then you can go find it. But oh, but if I put it in\nthis link in the description I could make it an affiliate link, and then I could get money\nevery time you click it. Man, the incentives of\nthe 21st century economy are just playing on my mind right now. Oh gosh. Okay. The last lesson here,\n\"Good journalism is important.\" Now hear me out on this.\n(bright electronic music) This might sound trite, but, I've learned over the years\nthat journalism is hard. To go out and gather information that doesn't exist in the world and to communicate it to the\nrest of the world is hard. Our country, these past few months, has shown me just how important and how sort of delicate\ngood journalism can be. Facts don't matter for a\nlot of people these days. And before you know it, you can have a person in power creating fake stories about an election, and you can have a news outlet that claims to be doing journalism, jump on board with that narrative and make up facts to support it. That's scary! Good journalism, the stuff\nwhere people are going out and actually scrutinizing evidence and presenting robust\narguments to an audience that is scrupulous back towards them, and there's a discussion, a discourse, that's rare and special. Here in the United States we\ncall it the \"Fourth Estate\", this institution of free press that keeps our leaders honest, keeps our corporations honest, keeps our society together and honest. There will always be\npeople and institutions whose sole purpose is to gain. Journalism offers a\nspotlight or a watchdog, on those actors on those institutions. And because of that, it's\nreally, really important. I am very, very grateful\nfor those journalists, especially right now,\nthis time in history, where covering the facts\nis so freaking important for keeping our society\npeaceful and together, and honest and working. I just, I'm grateful for the good journalism that's happening, the people out there hustling. And I lament the hostility that has been shown towards those people and I hope we can move on and\nget back to facts and truth. Thanks for watching.

    "title": "France Still Has An Empire",
    "video_id": "xykDDyHDTZY",
    "captions": "(gentle music) - France borders eight countries. Well, actually, no, it doesn't, it borders way more than eight countries. And in fact, its longest border isn't even this one with\nBelgium or this one with Spain, it's this one way over here with Brazil. What is going on here? I learned this on Reddit, and it quickly flung me\ndown a giant rabbit hole of some very strange information. I then put a call out on Instagram, and asked all of you to tell\nme what is going on with France and its giant overseas\nempire looking thing. I got a bunch of responses. So then I did what I always do, which is spent the\nentire day mapping this, every single island, every\nsingle administrative boundary, every single ocean border. I made an entire behind the scenes, by the way, for my patrons. Thank you, patrons, you guys rock. Yeah, it was a lot. But now I'm on the other side of it and I have some stuff to share with you. (upbeat instrumental music) By the way, this video is\nsponsored by Storyblocks, where I get a lot of amazing footage. More on that later. (upbeat instrumental music continues) Okay, so this is France, but really this is only\none version of France. They call this version of France, L'Hexagone, or the hexagon. It's also called La France Metropole, or the Metropolitan France. It's the mainland, it's\nthe motherland of France. It's the France you probably think of when you think of France here in Europe. But there's another France, it's called France d'outre-mer,\nor the Overseas France. And that one looks like this. This France accounts for almost\n20% of all of France's land, and a whopping 97% of its ocean territory, nearly 3 million French\ncitizens live here. This France is peculiar. It includes far-flung tropical islands, remote archipelagos with penguins, and weird looking, uninhabited\natolls all around the world. There's lobster fishing,\nand scientific research, and nuclear weapons testing,\nand military exercises. And the mind blowing fact here is that because France\nactually looks like this, that means that the European\nUnion actually looks like this. I wanna show you France's weirdest borders and pieces of land to try to\nunderstand why this country, that should have decolonized\nsix centuries ago, has territory all around the world. (upbeat instrumental music) All right, so let's go\nover to the Netherlands. No, no, no, not that Netherlands. Let's go this way over to the Caribbean. This is a little island\nthat is split in half between the Netherlands and France. It's the only place\nwhere these two countries share a border. The population here,\nthey're French citizens. A few years back, they did vote to become semi-independent from France, but even still they're French\ncitizens, this is France. Zoom out and you'll see\nthat France isn't alone. This whole neighborhood is full of European colonial holdovers. France has three other\nisland groups in this chain. Two of which are basically the\nexact same as mainland France in their administrative status. And then you get down here\nto France's longest border, which is in French Guiana, which is a proper part of France, and the European Union, and the eurozone. They use the euro here. But remember where we are,\nwe're in South America. This place was used as a prison colony for France most of the time. A lot of people were sent here for grueling prison sentences, many died. That's a whole other history,\nwe're not going into it. Okay, so this is French\nGuiana in the Caribbean, key part of France. Honestly, people just\nlike to vacation here, because they speak French and it looks like this. (mellow instrumental music) Anyway, let's zoom up North\nto a teeny, tiny island that is a holdover from the old days when France was colonizing North America. This little piece of\nFrance is 4,000 kilometers from France Metropole, but it is a few kilometers\noff the coast of Canada. And it's right smack dab in the middle of Canadian economic waters. France wanted to hold on to this and have it as their own little\nenclave away from France. And so a few years ago, they fought with Canada in\nthe international courts to try to carve out a little\nbit of economic waters for themselves that looked like this. It turns out they ended up only getting this little key-shaped\nslice of economic waters, so that they could have\na little passage way into their country from\ninternational waters to their little France enclave. And that's what it looks like today. It's a super weird situation. Here on this island, they use the euro and they speak French. Like France French, not Quebec French. It is a very French place, even though it is right smack dab in the middle of Canadian waters. Okay, so the Caribbean and this weird set of\nislands off of Canada. (upbeat instrumental music) Now let's get to the wild ones. The ones that were\nactually the hardest for me to get my head around\nas I was mapping them. (mellow instrumental music) If you zoom all the way down\nhere, close to Antarctica, all of these islands are owned by France. There are people who live on these islands who are French citizens. We'll get to those in a second. But first look at this\nweird looking block. I know it's a little bit awkward. Thanks Mercator. Let's look at it a little\nbit differently here from like an actual bottom up view. This slice of land is claimed by France. The Frenchmen arrived here in the 1800s and claimed it for France, and they've had people there ever since. That's a literal ice wall. Even in the 1800s, they knew\nthat there was an ice wall. The world is flat. Okay, so France claims this\nlittle bit of Antarctica. Zoom up just a little bit, and you'll get to all these French islands that have a ton of inhabitants, but they're just not humans. (mellow instrumental music) There are more king\npenguins on these islands than anywhere else in the world. And honestly, looking at\nphotos of these islands makes me feel like this\nis the part of France I want to visit more\nthan any part of France. I mean, look at this place. And the crest for this group of islands, the official crest, is\nlike really cool looking. I mean, it's got lobsters, and seals that are like yelling, and king penguins. I mean, this place is just\na wild, freaking dreamland. The only actual people\nwho live on these islands are French military and science personnel. So why did France hold on\nto these remote islands near Antarctica and these\nones here in the Indian Ocean? Well, other than the fact that France is, as our friend CGP Grey notes. - [CGP Grey] The queen of not letting go. - These islands provide France with a major presence in the Indian Ocean. Military presence, where\nthey can put bases, they can run patrols, they can just have a presence in this important geopolitical\npart of the world. - [Narrator] Here are the\nFrench military activities in the region between 2016 and 2019. You can see how these islands give France immense military presence in the region. - Okay, wait, I'm just trying to do like a fun geography explainer. I don't need to get into\nlike the military stuff. Can we just chill out for just one video? Can I just not explain the geopolitics? - [Narrator] Sure, but don't\nforget that these islands are also used to harvest\nover 16 million euros worth of fish and lobster. - Okay, stop, I get it. Military dominance, resource extraction, science stuff, I get it. - [Narrator] But wait, while we're here, I also wanna mention that\nduring the '60s and '70s, France literally stole\nhundreds of children from this island, one\nof their territories, to bring back to France to help boost the\ndeclining rural population. - Okay, that's actually\npretty effed up, yeah. Okay, so zoom to another really\nremote part of the ocean, this time the Pacific Ocean, so the most remote ocean in the world, and you will see a bunch of teeny tiny islands that are France. They're 14,000 kilometers\nfrom France Metropole, which is like a half a planet away. Like they are so remote. And to understand why France wants to hold on to these islands, just look at the water boundaries. The water boundaries of these 118 islands of French Polynesia are 5\nmillion square kilometers. For context, the entire European Union, like the landmass, the\narea of the whole EU, is 4.4 million square kilometers. So the water boundaries around\nFrench Polynesia are huge. It is a lot of water\nthat belongs to France. This place is home to\nBora Bora and Tahiti, and just a bunch of\nreally beautiful islands. So maybe I take back\nmy previous statement, this is the part of France\nI want to visit the most. - [Narrator] But wait, aren't\nyou forgetting something? - Yes, I'm sure I'm forgetting something. - [Narrator] French\nPolynesia is where France tested its nuclear weapons, almost 200 of them between\nthe 1960s and 1990s, damaging local populations\nand natural environments, and violating international law. - Yes, of course. Nukes in the Pacific Ocean, damaging irreparably populations\nand natural resources. I get it, yes, I should've known. I should've known, sorry. I'm just trying to do a\ngeography explainer, that's all. All right, let's look at one\nlast piece of Overseas France, which is right next to French Polynesia, but let's zoom to the\nother side of the map so we can see it better. This is New Caledonia. And they were actually on their way out of being a part of France. They were on a 20 year\nplan to transfer power completely to the people of New Caledonia. But just last month, just like literally a few\nweeks ago, they voted on this. The people voted and 53% of them said they wanted to stay with France, while 47% wanted independence. - [Reporter] Voters on the\nPacific islands of New Caledonia have, once again, rejected\nindependence from France. - France secretly loved this decision, because New Caledonia is full of nickel, something that they could mine. - The result was welcomed by France's President Emmanuel Macron. - There you go with your\nnatural resources again. And honestly, this vote of New Caledonia wanting to stay with France gets to the heart of the tension in all of these colonial holdovers. All of these islands are the\nproduct of French colonialism, brutal, greedy, racist colonialism. The people in these countries\nwere conquered and ruled by this ruthless power, who forced them to adopt their language, their government, and\ntheir economic structures. And yet here we are centuries\nlater in a globalized economy, where the world governmental\norder and system was invented by these\nbig colonizing powers, the Frances, the Britains of the world. France holds on to all of these islands, because of what we just talked about, military interests, expanding\ntheir economic waters, scientific research,\nexploiting natural resources. And so now you have many locals who live under France's rule\nand many want independence, but others realize that there are benefits to being attached to the\npeople who invented the rules and who still have the power. That is not an easy tension to resolve. For now, things likely won't change. This is France and will probably\nbe France for a long time. They will keep their sprawling, low key empire around the world. And France's longest\nborder will continue to be not with Belgium or\nSpain, but with Brazil. (midtempo instrumental music) Telling stories like\nthis is a visual puzzle, because obviously the mapping\nand the technical part, but also just being able to\nbring you to these places and bring myself to these\nplaces I'm researching is hard. I lean on a lot of different resources. And one of the major resources\nI lean on is Storyblocks, who is the sponsor of today's video. Some of the footage that\nyou saw in this piece, like this clip, and this\nclip, and this clip, those were all downloaded\nfrom Storyblocks. I didn't pay any extra to get these clips. I pay one subscription and\nI have unlimited access to over a million assets, a lot of that high-quality\n4K, beautiful footage. I can download as much of this as I want every month that I'm a member. I also get access to\nAfter Effects templates and audio resources, like sound effects. It is a tool in my toolkit that I don't know what I\nwould really do without. I've been using Storyblocks for years, well before they ever\ncame to sponsor a video. And I can't recommend them enough if you are someone who is\ntrying to tell stories, or improve your skills as a video maker, or someone who needs high quality assets for professional video making. Honestly, I use this\nfor all of my projects and I am very grateful to Storyblocks for supporting this channel. There is a link in my description, clicking that link helps\nsupport this channel, but it also gives you\na way to find out more on how you can get access to\nall of these amazing assets for a very, very affordable price. It's actually sort of blows my mind. Like compared to all other stock footage, which is usually very\nexpensive for just one clip and you pay by the second, with Storyblocks you pay one price and you get access to\nall of it, unlimited. So I don't really know how it works, but it does work and\nI use it all the time. So thank you, Storyblocks. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, patrons, for\nsupporting this channel as well. I was able to do a behind the scenes of my map workflow for patrons. I'm also outputting a high-res version of this France map that\nis on Patreon as well. So go check that out. Thank you all for being here, and I hope you're having\na great end of your 2020. And I will see you in 2021, bye. (mellow instrumental music)"

    "title": "How I Make My Maps",
    "video_id": "GsojLuJpe_0",
    "captions": "(clock ticks) - I wanna share with\nyou how I make my maps. (smooth music) Okay, I know all those\nclips are super fancy, but I need to tell you it\nwasn't always this way. I used to be very not good at making maps. Like, look at this first map\nI ever made back in 2012. A foreign service officer in the field. It pains me to look at\nthat and to hear my voice, and I'm trying to sound\nall cool and casual. You got to start somewhere I guess. From that time on I was 24 years old, I poured myself into\nlearning AfterEffects, the software that I used to make maps. I devoured tutorials and I got better and better at making maps to tell the types of\nstories I wanted to tell, and that's what this video is. It's sort of the result of\nmany, many years of refinement. So, today what I'm gonna\ndo, talk a little bit about my journey in map-making and the evolution of my style. And then I'm gonna dive into\ntwo different workflows. One is a workflow that\nrequires a $200 plugin, which is expensive. And I used to not be able to afford that. And so, I'm also going\nto teach you the workflow that doesn't include that plugin, a workflow that I used for years. Even at Vox I used it for\na long time for map-making. I don't use it anymore\nbecause it's less efficient but I wanna teach you both workflows, so you have both options. And using the workflow I use currently, I will show you how I make\nan animation like this. (smooth music) And all this I'm going to do\non a laptop that Intel send me. So everyone's heard of\nIntel, but this computer that they sent me has this Evo badge on it which is their brand\nnew 11th gen processor. The major highlight of this thing is that it is lightning fast, it provides an insane amount of speed. And by the way, there's\na link in my description that you can click to go learn more about the 11th gen processor\nand Intel Evo overall. Go click that link, support this channel, but also teaches you a lot more\nabout how this stuff works. Intel sent it to me, asked me to try out one of my heavy workflows\non it, see how it works. And that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take you along on the journey. But first, storytime. (smooth music) So after I made that\nfirst map back in 2012, the next year I graduated from college, moved to Washington DC, and\ngot a job at a think tank where I made map stories for them. That's where I really started to refine my map making workflow\nand learn how to use maps to tell a variety of different\nstories, to show data, to show historical trends, to draw different types of borders, to use it as a creative tool. And then in 2014 Vox was born\nand I got rejected from Vox, try it again, got accepted,\nand then started working there. I brought this map-making workflow to Vox, continued to refine it as I\ntold all sorts of stories. Eventually I started\ngoing out into the field and shooting sort of mini\ndocumentaries using maps to help compliment those stories. The series, after all,\nit was about borders and I found a need to draw\nreally specific borders in a really specific way to show data in a really specific way. And so, I had to upgrade my\nwhole map-making workflow. This all came to a head in\nthe last season of Borders which was Borders India,\nwhere I had to take a bunch of physical maps from\nthe partition of India and translate them into the digital space to tell this really\nimportant partition story. I tell you this whole story, number one, because I want you to know that I wasn't always good at maps. I was once very bad at maps and through a lot of practice got better. Okay, so, there's some hope in that. Number two, I want you to know that there's a lot of refinement and work that has gone into the\nworkflow I'm about to share. So just know that this isn't something I just sort of pulled out of my hat. This is something that I've\nbeen polishing for years. Okay, without further ado, let's do this. (smooth music) So, what's fascinating to\nme about this whole thing is that for the years that I've been developing this workflow, I have always worked on these\nlike big beefy computers. The fact that I'm sitting\nhere with this computer that is a little bigger than a tablet in terms of how light it\nis and how nimble it is. And the 11th gen processor\ngives you the power to take on this workflow is wild to me. It's wild, and it's sort\nof proving my age here. Like I'm sort of like\nthe old person being like back in my day. So as I promised, I'm going\nto show you two workflows. The one I did for many many years that doesn't require any plugins. It just requires AfterEffects,\nthe Adobe animation program which is a program that is\nenhanced by this processor. Then I will move on to the one that requires the\n$200 plugin called GeoLayers. If you want to just skip to\nthat, to the GEOlayers part, go to the time code that is here on screen and you can skip to it. But if not, let's dive in\nto my original workflow. One of the cool things here\nis that Intel actually works with Adobe to make sure\nthat their hardware works most efficiently\nwith their software. So they like collaborate. My original workflow is simple. It has to do with two main ingredients, AfterEffects and a file called Jenkins. This is a file that I refined for years. It's an Illustrator file\nthat has all of the countries in the world that are layered out. Not all of them are layered\nout, but a lot of them are. And that is very high resolution, in that you get some really nice detail in all of these countries. You can Command A and\nget all of them selected and you can change the stroke if you want, if you want the borders to be\nlike a dark gray or something, you can do that. It takes a minute because,\nwell, it doesn't take a minute. It, that was very fast. This is a big file. It's\ngot a lot of data in it. And this is what makes\nthis first workflow tick. This is free for all of my patrons. I have a bunch of people\non Patreon who support me. And this is a perk that I'm\nputting up right now on Patreon. So if you want this file,\ngo sign up on Patreon. Let's talk about how this\nworks in AfterEffects. I want to bring this into AfterEffects. I'll leave it open in Illustrator, and I'll show you why in\na minute, bring it in. And it's going to ask me right away, do you want this to be merged\nin as one piece of footage? Or do you want to make it a composition to have all the layers editable? For now, I just want footage. If you were doing something that had a lot of different layering of countries and you needed to make all the countries different colors or whatever, then you could make it a composition because it's all layered up. But for now, it's just\na big piece of footage. Take that big piece of footage and put it into a new comp. We'll call it map the old way. This is my old style, 1920 by 1080, make sure this is like, you\nknow, three minutes or something and you bring it right in. Okay, this is vector. So you can zoom in as\nmuch as you want on this. If this little thing is clicked, click, let's give this thing a\nbackground with Control Y. I'm going to make the background\nsort of like a bluish thing like that for water. I don't know. And now we've\ngot ourselves a background. I'll put it underneath and now let's say I want to change the color here. You could do it two ways. You could do it right here in Illustrator. You could select all and change the fill, but the easier way to do it is\njust to take a hue saturation and throw it on and start\nplaying with the hue saturation. Okay. That's nice. And again, if I wanted\nto change these borders, I could come in here,\nControl A and here and here. Make these borders all white and save. This is happening way faster\nthan what I'm used to. Okay. Anyway, next we go back. The file is now updated. So now I've got this thing\nthat I could zoom in on itself or better yet. I could make a null layer, new, null and this is going to be my controller. I will Control everything so Control. Okay. And I will parent\nthis guy right here. Again, make sure that this\nhas this little thing. So it looks like a little sunshine so that it stays nice\nand high res as we zoom. Okay. Next thing. I'm going to take the anchor point by holding down Y and I'm going\nto put it over the country. I want to zoom into for now. And I'm going to hit S for\nscale and start zooming and watch what happens. I can zoom as much as I want and boom, it's like crystal clear. So basically your animation, P and S is a matter of now putting\ntwo little keyframes, going to where you want to go next and going over a little\nbit or going this way. And you now animate and\nmaybe zoom out a little bit. Okay. And now you've got\nyourself a little animation. Okay. You can do that anywhere in the map. It's very simple. It\nis big, giant Jenkins. What if I want to color in Iraq? There is a very easy way to do this. You could either import Jenkins with all of the layers as compositions, and that's a different workflow. I'm not going to go into that but it is possible because\nall the layers are layered out in Illustrator, right here you can see. Or my favorite thing to\ndo is to check this out. Control Y, make a new solid,\nand I'm gonna call it Iraq. And this is the color of the\nthing I'm going to highlight. I'm gonna make it some orangy, something and I'm just gonna put it over the top. Okay. That is Iraq, but check it out. I'm now going to go back into\nIllustrator and to be safe. I'm going to hit A, to\nget the direct select tool which is a tool that\nreally doesn't select, doesn't include any of the\ngroupings that could be here. None of this is, it's all\npretty cleanly pared down but I'm going to grab\nthat, Control C for copy, back to AfterEffects. Oh, I have to have this, select it, Control V for paste and boom. That's actually Iraq. Watch what happens if I scale\nthis sucker up, scale it up. And now I have a mask that is Iraq, super low res, not for long, boom. That thing makes it\nnice and crystal clear. Now the trick is you want to make sure that this is parented\nto the same controller. So they're all part of the same system. So now during that little move that I did, I want this to animate on. So I'm going to take T, make a keyframe and bring it out and\nthen start it at zero. So it goes from zero\nto a hundred over time and you can see that as it\ngoes from left to right, it animates on. Okay. Boom. Okay. So that is the basics. This is how I used to do it. I used to make so many\nvideos using this workflow of zooming around using\na null and a big old file and layering stuff on top of it. And there was like 50 or a hundred layers. All parented to this one controller and it was pretty nuts, but\nthen I discovered GEOlayers. And more importantly, I\ncould afford GEOlayers. It is expensive, but so incredibly useful. So let's now move on to\nhow we would approach this same thing with GEOlayers, which is really a much\nmore powerful workflow. (upbeat music) So far, candidly, 100% like honestly, the 11th gen Evo processor is killing it. It's actually kind of\nfrustrating because I have, I'm used to working on these big, expensive beastly machines. And in some ways this is\noutpacing them like that. What it was doing in Illustrator\nwith the selection stuff, it's almost like, wait, what? I can get over that. I keep\ngoing, really cool though. Really cool that this little chip has so much power to make these workflows like buttery smooth in\nsuch a teeny little thing. So this next workflow is GEOlayers. I'm not going to go into how\nGEOlayers works fundamentally. There are loads of wonderful\ntutorials that GEOlayers itself has put together and you\nshould go watch those if you're interested in learning the fundamentals of GEOlayers. You'll pick up on some of them\nby seeing what I'm doing here but I'm not going to go step-by-step. In this next workflow, I'm going to show you how to style a map to exactly how you want to style it. I'm going to show you how\nto set it up with GEOlayers and to link that styling into GEOlayers, to move stuff around, and then to label and do\nsort of what we did here with Iraq where you can draw a country. All of that is so much easier\nin GEOlayers. Check it out. I'm going to make a new comp and I'm going to call\nthis comp map the new way. First things first, we're\ngoing to pull up GEOlayers. I have it all installed, and\nI'm going to go to extensions. I'm going to go to GEOlayers.\nIt's going to power up. So I'm going to hit the tilde key in the upper left to\nmake this full screen. It just makes it a lot easier\nfor me to see, for you to see, for everyone to see, this\nis blinking right now because this is where\nyou need to click first, create a new map comp. A map comp is basically\na map that you can style and move around. I'm going to call this one Iraq map, okay? And it will live within\nthe comp we just made which was called mapping the new way. Okay, after I hit next, it's going to ask me what the style is. You can license some of\nthis data that they have on the GEOlayers site or you can pick one of\ntheir default styles or you can do what I do,\nwhich is go to Mapbox. Mapbox are the people behind\na lot of the mobile apps you use, the maps you use\nfor like Uber or GrubHub. I don't know, but like\nthose types of maps, Mapbox makes those, but\nhack of the world is that you can design your own maps and not use them for an app,\nbut use them in GEOlayers, check it out. This is called Mapbox Studio and it is free for you to use\nfor non-commercial purposes. So new style coming here,\nand you can choose one of these pre-baked styles that they have. Let's do outdoors. The beautiful thing about this\nis you can now customize it. So outdoors is really a\nnice-looking map style. So this is just like\na sort of Google Maps. And you can see that as I zoom,\ndifferent features come on. Like, as I just zoomed right\nnow, all of these interstates and their signs came on, all these labels. I don't want all these\nthings. You may, but I don't. I like to clean up my map. So I'm going to go over to Iraq, which is the place that\nwe are focusing on here. And I'm going to go simply\nclick on a place like Baghdad and say, place labels. I'm going to click it. And\nI'm going to say place labels. I actually don't want to see you. So countries, nope. States\nand provinces, nope. Settlements. Nope. Subdivisions. None of it. I'm also seeing these provincial borders which I don't really want to see. You may want to see those. I don't. So I'm going to hit\nadministrative boundaries, disputed country boundaries. I don't know if you want\nthose, state and province. Boom. That's what we don't want. Okay. So you can start\nto see the power of this. We went from a big cluttered design to a super clean nice design that we can put our own labels on. Once this is in GEOlayers. Yes. This is going to be\nin GEOlayers pretty soon. This is ready for me to\nbring into AfterEffects. The way I do that is first\nhit publish, publish. And then I'm going to get a special code that I'm going to use in AfterEffects. You go up to share and warning. This is going to look like\nblack magic what I'm about to do because it's like so\nburied in these menus. You go to share, you\ngo over to third party. She can go here to Cardo and\nyou grab this API address. Copy it, okay? You take\nthis sucker over to here. You remember where we were here? We had made the map comp and now it's asking us what\nkind of style do we want? We want to add a new style and we want to paste it into\nthis URI code, Command V paste. Boom. There's our map. And I'm going to hit apply.\nSo now I've got this new map. Well, I'm gonna actually\nrename it to outdoor map. Okay? I've got that big API\ncode. I'm gonna hit apply. And here it is, outdoor,\nbeautiful and create. And now it's doing its magic and it is creating a comp that allows me to see this map comp, but in AfterEffects. Here's the deal, though. You won't see it in high res right away. At first, you'll see it sort of like this. These are temporary tiles,\nthat it just downloads for you to block out your\nanimation and start moving. Eventually when you're\ndone, you'll hit finalize and it will download\nall these high res tiles as good as you want them. So let's talk about what\nis going on in here. You have two layers down here. You have the map, which\nthat's the baseline thing. You're never going to animate the position or scale of this. I'll show you what you do animate. And then you have this anchor. This anchor is the thing\nthat you anchor anything you want to stick on the map you parent it to this and it will stick. And we'll get to that in a minute. But first let's just figure\nout how to move around. The easiest way to move\naround is just with this thing over here, zoom out, and\nthe map comp zooms out, zoom in and the map comp zooms in, drag and then outcome drags, and get ready for the best part. Right click and drag\nup. And you get a tilt. Look at that. Okay. You're starting to see\nhow I make my videos now. This is like, you're probably like seeing\nhow the sausage is made. You're like, oh, that's how he does it. So let's, let's do some keyframes. I'm going to start here, way back here and I'm going to zoom out. I want it to start up here and I'm going to hit this big old, oops, I'm gonna hit this big, old\nkeyframe button right here. I'm going to go forward to, you know, seven seconds and I'm\ngoing to zoom in to Iraq. So I'm just going to zoom\nin by scrolling, okay. Zooms in. This isn't finalized. So it'll look better when it's finalized. Let's say I want it to\nstart wide, zoom into Iraq, wait there for a minute and then zoom in to a little village in the South of Iraq. So I'm going to have it wait there for maybe, I dunno, four seconds. And then I am going to\nlook at all of these. These are the keyframes\nthat run GEOlayers, latitude, which makes it go up and down, longitude, which makes\nit go left and right, zoom, which makes it zoom, bearing, which watch, makes it spin, and pitch, which makes it go down. Okay, you can, if you're\nmore comfortable down here with these, you can just\nkeyframe everything down here. Instead of using this UI. I'm\ngoing to get rid of these. So we zoom in and I tend\nto always go right onto the keyframes and make sure\nthere's a keyframe everywhere. It's going to sit for a little bit and maybe during, while it's sitting I'm going to have it pitch\ndown, just a titch like this. Okay. Everything else\nI'm going to have sit. And now I want it to zoom\ninto a little village in Southern Iraq called Basra. It's not a village, it's a city. It's one of the big cities in Iraq. I could either go find\nit and try to zoom in, but here's where GEOlayers\nbecomes truly magical. You can search on the internet\nfor addresses, for cities, for even latitude and longitude. And in fact, again, you can\nalways take this guy tilde and get the full screen here. I'm going to hit Basra,\nB-A-S-R-A, okay, Basra. And there it is, this is Basra in Iraq. It says it right there. This is data scraped from the internet. You can do several things here. You can make a label which\nwe'll do in a little bit. You can fit view, which means it will take where your camera is\nor where you're zoomed. And it will zoom you in to Basra. I'm going to hit that, boom. And now watch what happens when I go back, hit tilde and I'm in Basra. And because I was back here, it did all of the latitude\nand longitude for me to the point where I'm now in Basra. So now I have a zoom from\nhere all the way into Basra. I'm going to put myself\nover those keyframes and maybe pitch down just a little bit. Maybe do this bearing a little bit. And maybe what I'll do\nis I'll take this bearing and I'll bring it out a\nlittle bit so it orbits. So this bearing is sort of coming down and orbiting like this. It's a little bit delayed. The more you delay it, the\nmore sort of orbiting happens. This is cool. This is looking really, really cool in a matter of a few minutes, okay. Let's say I want to\nhighlight Iraq, label it, and then zoom into Basra. So first things first, I am going to try to find a shape of Iraq. Now you remember how we did\nthat with the Illustrator file and all of that, that was very\nclunky and sort of handmade. This is a lot smoother.\nSo I'm gonna hit back. It's really important that you hit back. Cause right now, when you're\nsearching the internet, you're in this sort of second\nlayer of the interface. You wanna hit back to\nget back to your home. You have your search internet up here, but then you have this hub. This is like your data hub down here. Again, I'm going to go\ntilde and make it big. Your data hub is where\nyou can put geo data sets, which are like, GOJSONs,\nthat's a little advanced if you're new to this,\nbut more importantly, an example of a dataset is a country, like how a country's shape is. You can go here and add a\nfeature to this data browser. And I want to download features and I want to download countries. So now it's downloading, I\nnow have natural earth data for every single country in the world. What I'm going to do is\nI'm going to find Iraq or I can just filter out\nright here, Iraq boom. There it is. And I'm going\nto hit the draw feature. Which may be cut off a little bit if your interface is a little bit, you need to sort of scroll to get to it. Now, if I do that, you can\neither have an animate on, which I don't ever really use,\nI like to just have it drawn and then I can animate it myself and boom. There it is. What I love about this is\nit comes already anchored and like ready to roll, here it is, Iraq, it's anchored to this anchor null, which is really important. And so now anything I\ndo, it will go with it. Now let's make a label for Iraq generally, you can use the label maker in here, which I'll explore in a minute but I also just want to show\nyou how I do it with text. So I'm going to hit\nControl T to get my text. I'm going to type in Iraq. Now, remember this\nthing has to be anchored to the Iraq map anchor,\nor it won't scale with us. It'll just stay in the middle like that. Whereas if I do this and I bring it here, everything, everything,\neverything that you want to stick to that needs to be anchored. I also need to make it 3D if I want it to respond to some of these. Yeah. Like that. Okay. You see now it's\ntotally stuck to it. Next let's zoom in to\nBasra and label Basra. We're going to zoom in. I'll probably want this\norange to sort of fade away while we zoom. So I'm going to hit T for\ntransparency or opacity. And we're now in Basra. I could either do the\ntext thing that I just did or a really cool feature is I'm going to search\nBasra again, B-A-S-R-A. And instead of having it fit\nview, like I did the first time I'm going to hit make label or add label. Boom. And there it is, Basra. And that Basra right there is responsive. So I could have it as it, as\nwe zoom out, look at that. It scales with the map comp in\nthis really cool dynamic way. You can come here. There's all sorts of\nthings you can do here to make it react a little bit differently. That is labeling. So this next step is the most important in terms of time management. It takes time and in\nterms of making sure that your map looks beautiful. So I'm going to hit finalize. What that's going to do\nis it's going to connect to the server of that Mapbox\nstudio profile that we made. And it's going to download little JPEGs from the internet onto this machine. And then it's going to\narrange them perfectly and put expressions in the\nmiddle, do all this stuff so that it looks really\nnatural to what we animated. It's a really magical process and it requires good\ninternet or decent internet. And it requires good processing power because it's a lot of\ncalculations happening at once. This machine has a new wifi chip that should work great for this. It also has the 11th gen Evo processor that hopefully will make\nthis a much smoother process. So I'm going to hit finalize\nand we'll see what happens. Okay. You can see it\ndownloading all these images. It goes on to a part of your hard drive that you can specify,\nand it is placing them into the right space in the\nmap comp for it to work. It's honestly really amazing. Oh, are we done? We're done. Wow. That was insanely quick. Again, this video is sponsored by Intel. I know like, I've done this so many times. That was very fast.\nThat was buttery smooth. Again, I sort of feel like,\nwhy have I been relying on these insanely beefy\nexpensive machines? When I pitched this idea of like, I'm going to do my map workflow that usually I do on\na big monster machine, I was sort of like, can this\nlittle laptop handle that? And it 100% can. It can handle\nit better than I thought. So I'm very impressed with the 11th gen Evo\nprocessor from Intel. And again, that's a totally\ncandid thing to say right now. Like I'm actually reacting\nto how well it's doing. You can do all sorts of\nstuff to style this up, color correct, Lutz, whatever you want. But this is the basic heart\nof my mapping workflow. Let's get this thing rendered out and see what it finally looks like. Now, render times are really important for video people because they\ncan make or break your day. If you have really long render\ntimes with these animations, you don't want to render very often. And so you end up just guessing\nand sort of doing everything in the AfterEffects and\nthen doing one big render and just like hoping that it works. When you have faster render times, it allows you to output sort\nof a draft and say like, I think this is pretty close to good. You bring it in to Premiere. You time it up. And then if it's wrong\nor if there's mistakes, like there always are, you\njust go back and you fix them and you render out a new\none and it's like, no drama. It's not like you're committing\nto three hours of waiting. Instead, it happens very quickly. So here's the remaining time. As it digests this it's going\nfrom what was 57 minutes. And it is just tanking by the second. This is real time right\nnow what you're seeing. It turns out if I go into\nthe log that that took, in coding time six minutes and 33 seconds to render that big beast. That's awesome. So this\nwas a real experiment. I hadn't actually used this\nlaptop to do this workflow until right here in front of you all. And I'm incredibly impressed\nwith the performance. This is a small little laptop. It fits in something that is\na little bigger than a tablet. I mean, look at this. And yet I was able to do my\nstart to finish map workflow which is fairly processor\nintensive on this thing. And it held up just fine while I had multiple applications open I had the screen recording software open, all at the same time. The thing that makes this whole process run so smoothly is the 11th\ngen Evo processor from Intel. This chip is a huge leap forward for Intel and for all processors on the market. It uses AI to actually reduce\nnoise in a really smart way. So you don't have to worry\nabout background noise when you're on an important call. The chip also helps enhance audio to make it sound richer and better. It helps display for gaming\nand for video editing. No matter how you look at\nit, whether it's streaming or being productive in the\noffice or editing maps, this chip is a powerhouse and it enables for much faster workflows, as I just saw right before your eyes. There's a link in my description\nwhere you can learn more about the devices that have\nthe Intel 11th gen processor and you can learn more about\njust Intel Evo overall. click that link and help\nsupport this channel. But it's also a great\nplace to go learn more about this really cool,\nfast, amazing processor. The first batch of these amazing\nprocessors inside laptops are hitting the shelves\nthis holiday season. And if you're someone who\nis looking for an upgrade in your workflows, this\nis a fantastic option. Thank you, Intel, for\nsupporting this channel and supporting this video and allowing me to make a video I've wanted to make for a long time. I wanted to share this\nworkflow with you all for a long time. A lot more behind the scenes\nis shared on my Patreon. If you want to go over and check that out, thank you all for being here. And I hope it's a happy holiday season for those celebrating\nholidays and happy New Year. And I'll see you soon. (upbeat music)"

    "video_id": "BkUH2tP8PYw",
    "captions": "- SpongeBob is talking a\nlot about global warming, and he's only looking at\nit from one point of view. - Why I hate the news. - Brainwashed by the mainstream media. - Oh, brainwashed. - Santa just is white. - Jesus was a white man too. - He wrote a sentence ending\nwith a brand new word. - [Sean] The President and\na small group of people know exactly what he meant. - It seems like a weird\ntitle for me to use because I'm a journalist. At least that's what I think I am. I worked at a journalistic institution. I just did a piece at\n\"The New York Times.\" Can you call me a journalist? I'm a journalist, right? Now I'm feeling insecure. Okay, so whatever. I'm a journalist but I\nkind of hate the news. Let me explain. (whooshing) - [Announcer] CNN Breaking News. - [Woman] Tonight, it\nall comes down to this. - So, let's just first define\nwhat the news is or should be. The news or the press\nor the fourth estate, this sort of sacred thing, is meant to be a magnifying\nglass on our society. It's meant to look at the things\nthat are really important, to make people stand accountable, to highlight the issues that\nyou should be thinking about when you're voting or going\nabout your day-to-day life. It's meant to give you\nimportant information about things like, I\ndon't know, pandemics. (upbeat music) - Clearly Nickelodeon is\npushing a global warming agenda. - In short, it's meant to\nkeep the people informed and aware of what is\nimportant in the world. But as a news consumer myself and as someone who wants to be informed and to understand how the world works, I find that the news less and less and less actually helps me do that. - It is not the newspaper- - But now you're pedaling in dishonesties - So I've been thinking about this and I wanna share it with you. I'm gonna give you three\nreasons why I hate the news. Number one, the news often tells you what isn't actually\nhappening in the world. There's this onion article\nthat just sums it up so well .00003% of things\nthat happen actually matter. Oftentimes we look at the\nnews and we see crazy things that are happening around the world. If there is a mass homicide, that would be national\nnews tomorrow morning, if there's a terrorist\nattack around the world, that will be national\nnews tomorrow morning. If a prominent politician says something really embarrassing, that will be national\nnews tomorrow morning. - What's the naughtiest\nthing you ever did? - I have to confess when me and my friends sort of used to run through\nthe fields of wheat, the farmers weren't\ntoo pleased about that. - What all these things\nhave in common is that they don't happen very often, they're super rare. They don't teach us anything about how the world actually works, they teach us about how\nthe world doesn't work and how sometimes it does,\nthe outliers, the aberrations. My big problem with this is that someone who reads the news every day\nand uses it as their gateway into the world will often walk away with a completely delusional version of how the world works. They will assume that terrible\nthings happen more often than they actually do. Our view of the world is at stake here. When the information available to us is the stuff that doesn't\nhappen very often, the stuff that's actually\nan aberration from the norm. We get a distorted view\nof how the world works. Number two, the news\nhas become way too fun. - [Man] Meeting with\nthe pirate, no problem. - [Announcer] Tonight,\npresident Donald Trump fighting for a second term as\na deadly pandemic gets worse. - This is not a legal proceeding. - This is the congress of the united- - This is an impeachment. - My old colleague, Carlos\nMaza has thought a lot about how fun the news has become. I called him up and we chatted about it. How are you? - I know good to see your face. See for longest, as long as\nyou've had corporate news in America is that we have a product that is trying to meet two\nvery different objectives or a suit, a very different incentive. - What Carlos explained to\nme that was really helpful was that the news has\ntwo opposing incentives. The first incentive is what I\ntalked about at the beginning of this video, which is\nto inform the people, to teach you what you should care about, to give you a framework for\nunderstanding the world, for highlighting important information the public should know, but then there's this other incentive. - The corporate media is\ntrying to sell you a product and they sell your\nproduct to make you think you need as much of it as\nhumanly possible all the time. (upbeat music) So newscasts should be\nmaybe an hour every day and then you're done\nlike, go do your thing. You have this other incentive though, while you have a corporate\nmedia environment that is like always breaking. (logo squishing) There's always a new thing\nthat you have to worry about. So you have this basically\nimpossible impasse of a product that you should\nnot really need that much, that shows a specific function\nbeing run by companies that want you to need it all the time. - I am not distracting. - You've been doing it for\nover a year and a half. - I haven't been doing that. - Well you have. - What this does, is it\nincentivize programming that is optimized to appeal to our senses, whether it's fear based sensationalism or whether it's flashy graphics, article titles that are\na little bit click baity. The economic incentive\nthat is built into news makes it really difficult\nfor news to honor that first incentive. - I call them a moron, and then I modified\nthat word with a vulgar Anglo-Saxons term that is\nalso intelligible in dutch. - And instead, to prioritize entertainment and false feelings of this is\nimportant or this is scary. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] This is CNN breaking news. - It seems like a really dangerous thing to be so subject to economic forces. Okay, my number three is\nthat the news tricks you into feeling informed. For a long time I read\nthe news every single day, I would go on and read\nmultiple different outlets and I would feel that day like check. Okay, I believe that I'm\nan informed smart person and I've just sort of\nconfirmed that belief because there's this sort\nof like glorification of the person who like\nreally up on the daily news. What I've learned is that\nthat's actually not the case. - Why don't people just check out and that's a legitimate response, like if the town prior in your\nvillage constantly screaming, 10,000 horrific things at\nyou from other villages that you don't live in,\nafter all you'd stop really meaningfully listening to it because your brain can not\nsort out what catastrophe is real and meaningful and\nwhat you shouldn't respond to. So you have this like kind\nof ambient anxiety always that makes it so that your\nbrain becomes numb to the drug. You stop really caring about\nwhat you should engage in. - Spending a lot of time\nchasing the new cycle is a lot of mental energy. It's a lot of mental energy\nthat could be applied to understanding how the\nworld actually works, consuming things that actually shed light on important issues like,\npolicy or I don't know, historical trends that maybe\nare not as flashy and reactive, but are way more indicative\non how the world works, how things get done, how\nchange gets made in a society. Instead because of this\nentertainment incentive, the news doesn't actually end\nup being super informative. You're not actually learning\na lot about anything other than what happened that\nday, who said what to whom and why, and then how a\nbillion people reacted to why that person said whom. And it's like, it becomes a\ngiant gossip first almost. - Binge watch like the\nRockford files, Netflix. - Or modern love\n- That's terrible. Modern love makes me sick. - How about person of interest? - Ooh, I like that, that's a good show. - Can I say something now? - Yes.\n- No! - It's built to appeal\nmore to our gossip impulse than to our desire to\nlearn about the world. The epidemy of this is the sort\nof like pseudo debate format that a lot of TV news takes apart. - The five person talking head panel, you have moderator who pretends\nto be relatively neutral and then four commentators\ntwo from the left, two from the right who\nare arguing about whatever the topic of the day is. That format is a straight rip from ESPN. Like those formats are a\ncarbon copy of the arguing and almost like a reality\nTV model that has been used in sports media for a while. - This is not journalism. This looks like journalism\nbecause it looks like there's a robust debate going on. - Stop it, you're abusing\npower right now on air. Stop filibustering her. - But journalism is about evidence. It's about going out\nand gathering evidence and scrutinizing it and\nthen putting it together and presenting it to a reader. In this sensationalized news segment, no evidence is being\nexamined or scrutinized or cross-examined. - It serves no educational function, regardless of what you\nthink about politics, watching two people\nargue is not informative because it's too fast paced, it triggers your tribal defenses, you're not gonna be open-minded and there's no time to examine evidence, no matter how long that fight goes on for, you are not gonna learn\nanything meaningful from it. All will happen is that\nyou will leave thinking, \"God, I really hate the other side.\" And God by sight is so right. It's the opposite of what\njournalism should be doing. - You don't leave a debate\nlike this anymore informed, all you do is leave a debate like this with like an understanding\nthat your side is right, the other side is wrong\nand like how awesome that like the people who\nrepresented your side were like so hard on the opposing side, which is a super awesome\nimpulse if you're like in a football stadium watching\nyour favorite team play. But when we're talking\nabout like real issues and real policy, this sports\nframework of commentary and fighting is not very useful because it tricks people into thinking that they're informed, that they're like, \"oh, I get the issues now\n'cause I watched that debate.\" But instead all they were was entertained. - I'm tired of having this\ndiscussion over and over again. - So those are my three reasons\nfor why I hate the news. So let me just say one thing, which is there is still amazing journalism being done right now,\nreally important journalism that is communicating important evidence, about important ideas\nthat truly can inform you about how the world works. The incentives of this industry\nmake it harder and harder for that journalism to happen. But the journalists who are\nout there collecting evidence, reporting on really difficult things, talking to lots of experts,\ntrying to piece together, all of this information so that\nthey can inform the public. Those are the people\nwho are doing this work in spite of the entertainment,\ncorporate 24 hour news cycle that has sort of taken\nover what news should be. And what I really believe\nand I learned this working at Vox, a place that\nreally focused on context and explainer journalism,\nthere's a demand for it, there will always be a\ndemand of voyeuristic demand for seeing terrible things happen. There will always be\ndemand for entertainment and shouting matches, but\nI believe that most people want to understand,\nthey want to understand why this certain policy will\nwork and the other one won't. They want to understand the real debates, the philosophical and political debates that are happening in our system. They wanna understand how our system works or doesn't work. And if only our news\nindustry could focus more on that desire, that desire to understand, instead of this facade of information that is really just entertainment. - The media is shoving\nthis down your throat. - By the way, our ratings are great. - Shouldn't they for a period\nof time not go on the attack? - They were fear-based. - They were fear-based. - Hate in teleprompt. - Can you give us an answer,\nwhy were you attacking us. - Don't be rude, you are fake dues. - All right, well, that\nwas a little bit of a rant. Just taking some deep breaths, glad I got that out of my system.

I am in the middle of\nbrainstorming, some really fun wild big deep videos for 2021, some international explainers\nthat I am working on right now that I think\nyou're all gonna really like, and they just take more\ntime to do journalism, just takes more time. I have to go and like read all this stuff, talking to the experts,\nreading all of like the journals and the think\ntank pieces and all this stuff, putting it together that just takes time. But quality journalism is an\nimportant thing, so anyway have a great day I'll talk to you later. - SpongeBob what are you doing? - Just rolling another tire on the fire by global warming Mr Graham.

    "captions": "- [Narrator] There's a\nlot of international mail that flows to a small\nnation in Western Africa. The mail is addressed to an address that should be right here\nalong this main street. But I asked my friends to\ngo there and check it out, and he didn't find anything. - I've been looking for 80 Broad Street. I'm gonna say that 80\nBroad Street doesn't exist. - [Narrator] Instead, the mail\nthat is addressed to go here is actually brought to a building\ndown the road, right here. - Right here, this building is where all\nLISCR bills are forwarded, from the building that doesn't\nexist on 80 Broad Street. - [Narrator] From there,\nthe mail is scanned and sent electronically\nthousands of miles away to a nondescript office building\noutside of Washington, DC, it's actually right near my\nhouse in Northern Virginia. - Henry check out this random building. Does this building looks\nsuper boring to you? - Ooh. - This building is right near our house. I guess I expected something\na little bit more interesting. - [Narrator] This process\nis a part of a secretive web of corporate secrecy. It's a web that is built off\nof years of strange connections between the United States\nand the country of Liberia, a nation invented by a group\nof Americans here in Virginia. This is how the US stashed its secrets off the coast of West Africa. - In this building, there is a bunch of mail that comes from a little country in West Africa, and it gets sent to this\nbuilding near our house. Does that seem kind of weird to you? - Yes, what do they do with it? (chuckles) - That's what I wanna figure out here. So, let's say I wanna start\nan international corporation and start doing business abroad. I live here in the United States, so naturally I would wanna\nstart my company here in the US, but when I asked the\ninternet how to do this, I get a bunch of ads that look like this. Even though my office would be here in Washington, DC in the United States, the internet is telling me that on paper, I should set up my corporation\nin one of these random, small countries around the world. Places like the British\nVirgin islands, or Mauritius, or Belize, Gibraltar, Malta,\nthe Seychelles Islands, wait, the Seychelles like\nthat tiny Island nation in the middle of the Indian ocean, that has like less than a\nhundred thousand people. It's like 40 hours of flying to get there, why would I wanna set up my\nbusiness in the Seychelles? (upbeat music) Here's why. If I set up my corporation on paper, in the British Virgin\nislands or the Seychelles, suddenly I actually don't\nhave to pay very much taxes, if any at all. My new corporation now won't have to actually obey any of the corporate laws here in the United States, which require you to publish\nall sorts of information about your finances, about your corporation\nto the public record. If my corporation is in the Seychelles, I don't have to do any of that, this is actually starting to seem like a pretty attractive option. These tiny nations have set up their laws to attract big corporations\nfor this very purpose, to set up on paper in their country, so that the government can\nmake a little bit of money off of the little taxes they receive and any of the registration fees and dues. And it's not just corporations, the same concept applies\nto shipping vessels. These are big barges that\nmake our world economy run, and they spend most of their time in water that belongs to no country, and yet they still have\nto follow the rules of the country, whose flag they fly, where they're registered. And so if you register to a\ncountry that has very low taxes, and no laws around how you need to treat your employees on the boat, and what safety regulations\nyou need to follow, then those are the\nrules you need to follow when you're out on the high sea. So, the modern global economy turns out to be a race to the bottom. Corporations and shipping vessels, registering themselves to\nwhatever country will give them the least amount of\naccountability and transparency, we call these havens,\ntax havens or shelters. And this isn't just like\nshady criminal corporations, most corporations that you\ninteract with on a daily basis, have loads of subsidiaries\nin far away tax havens, that they have set up to escape transparency and accountability. (low tempo music) - Okay, but back to me and my corporation that I\ntheoretically want to sign up, If I wanna set up in the Seychelles or the British Virgin islands, this is actually kind of complicated, how do I navigate all the\nlaws and the paperwork? Ask the internet. And when I asked the internet,\nI get a bunch of ads. These are ads of companies\nwho are dedicated to helping corporations set up in these offshore jurisdictions\nand these tax havens. So, if I wanna set up in\nthe British Virgin islands, I could choose a bunch\nof different companies to help me get that paperwork done. And then while I actually do my business back here in Washington, DC, they help manage all the\ntaxes and the requirements, and all the little things I need to do to upkeep my little facade of having a company in this place, even though I actually don't. Okay, so here's where this gets weird, we're talking about tax havens\nand offshore jurisdictions and all this stuff, let's\nget back to Liberia, which Liberia is one of these tax havens. It's a place that has structured its laws to attract foreign corporations\nand shipping vessels, to register with them so that\nthey can make a little money off of those dues and taxes. - [Narrator] When I go to start\nmy corporation in Liberia, I don't get a bunch of ads for middlemen who wanna help me set up my\nnew Liberian corporation, instead I'm funneled to\none company, this one, and this company boasts that\nit has the exclusive right to handle all companies\nthat wanna register their corporation or ship in Liberia. This is the company whose\nbuilding is near my house. And on the surface, it just\nlooks like another middleman, paper pusher, super boring, but you peek under the surface and there's something\nway bigger going on here. Not just a corporation\nrunning away from taxes and accountability, but instead this is a symbol of how the US projects its\npower in the 21st century, and how it uses other\ncountries to hide its secrets. (dramatic music) - Quick pause for a second. This story is crazy and it's\nabout to get even more crazy. The whole reason I'm going\ndown this rabbit hole, that I started to look\ninto this Liberia thing, is because of a phone call I had. I was driving North up to\nMassachusetts a couple months ago, many of you may have seen\nthe videos from that trip, and it was on the phone with\nmy friend Ben over at Fully, Fully is the company who makes my desk and the chair I'm sitting on. Ben and I got chatting. I just announced that\nI report was canceled, and I was sort of moving\non to new projects, and he was like, what\nstories do you want to make? And like, can we support your stories? I was like, yes, but like anything that has to do with like the global economy, which is something I'm\nsort of interested in. I'm gonna go deep and I'm\ngonna uncover crazy stuff, and like your company does\nbusiness in the global economy, and he was like, do it. I wanna see like what\nstorytelling you can do and we wanna support that. For context here of Fully is a B Corp. A B Corp is a type of corporation that isn't just the standard\nprofit seeking company, instead they make major\nefforts to be transparent, to be socially impactful\nin a positive way, to be accountable and to be sustainable, that's rare, that's a rare thing. Fully does not claim to be perfect, all they say is that they're\nmaking a major effort, to be the type of corporation\nthat leaves a positive impact on the people who use the product, but also the people who\ninteract with the production, and to leave a positive impact\non the globe while doing so. And that's why they're\nsupporting this video today, is because they care\nabout this sort of thing, and they want to always\nbe pushing the limit on how we think about business, and how we think about the impact of corporations in the world. And I respect that, that is so rare among\ncompanies these days, and so I love Fully for that reason, oh, and they make amazing products, like that's also a giant part of this. So my desk, a lot of the stuff\nin our studio is Fully stuff. They sell really high quality\nproducts, desks, and chairs, and all sorts of products\nthat make you more active, and just improve your\nrelationship with work. They don't want you to buy these products unless you actually need them. But there's a lot of\npeople these days who tend to need a new work from home set up, given the times we're in, and so they are running\na sale on their site for the whole month of November, which is a few days left in that sale. These are not just your standard desks, these are an investment in a product that will last you a very long time. They're solid, they're well-built. Go onto the Fully site,\ncheck out their products, see if there's anything there\nthat you need right now. But the major here is Fully\nwants you to be thoughtful about the stuff that you buy, knowing that it's often a\npart of a much larger system. Thank you Fully for supporting this video. Let's get back to the story of Liberia and what the heck is happening in Liberia, it gets pretty nuts from here. (upbeat music) What's the deal? Why does this one random\nbuilding in Virginia, run a network of corporate secrecy in the country of Liberia? Like it's so weird, and as soon as you start to\ngo down this rabbit hole, it just gets weirder. And the short answer here is that the United States of\nAmerica literally invented the country of Liberia. Back in the 1800s here\nin the United States, the biggest, most important\ndebate was over slavery. This issue led the country\nto almost imploding on itself in a bloody civil war. During this debate, there emerged three major\ncamps with the slavery issue. One where the abolitionists,\nthe people who were like, dude, this is wrong, let's reform our country to be done with this\nterrible thing we've done. And then of course there were the people on the pro-slavery side, who were often had a financial incentive to keep slavery alive\nwith their plantations and their businesses. But then there was this\nthird camp in the middle, who were on paper against slavery. They wanted to get rid of\nslavery, it was a bad thing, but they didn't really want\nthe freed black Americans to integrate into American society. As this debate, raged on, there were some Americans here in Virginia who came up with a solution. What if we gave the option to enslaved people who had been freed, to go to Africa where\ntheir ancestors came from? We could ship them back. We could buy a piece of land\nand they would all flock to the boats to go back to\nAfrica was the thinking here. The quasi abolitionists\nkind of liked this, 'cause they're like, Oh yeah, we can get the moral buzz\nout of being against slavery, but we don't have to deal with\nthe complicated consequences of our actions to reintegrate\nthese people into our society. And then of course the\nslave owners liked this too, because it meant that\nany freed black Americans could be shipped away, so they wouldn't foment\nrebellion among those enslaved people who were still\nworking on plantations. So, there was this strange alignment between these quasi abolitionists\nand these slave owners, and they started their own organization. - [Narrator] So, this organization that was based here in Virginia, bought a piece of land in Western Africa, with money from their supporters\nand from the US government. And they started sending\nships full of black people to this land to create a\nsettlement that they called Liberia or land of the free. They named the Capital Monrovia, after president James Monroe, who was a fierce supporter of this effort to send away free black Americans. - Okay, so at this point,\nI'm sure you're kind of like, wait a minute, what was this curve ball? We went from talking about\nthe Seychelles and tax havens, to talking about how a bunch of Virginians started sending freed black Americans to a piece of land in\nAfrica that they bought, and this is where these two come together. Soon, the Liberians declare independence. Liberian locals, the ones who had come\nfrom the United States, that started to take power and actually be the\nleaders of the country. They actually started to\nenact slavery of their own in their society, just like they had seen\nin the United States. But behind the scenes of all of this, the US political interests that started this whole thing remained. They had an actual building there and they were actually calling the shots. So Liberia was independent on paper, but in reality the US had\nas much influence as ever, in their little colony in Africa. And that influence became really useful a hundred years later. (upbeat music) So it's a hundred years later, the US just got out of world war II and you have this guy, this guy was the secretary\nof state for the US, which is like a foreign minister. He became a US representative at the UN, and he was out on a diplomatic tour that brought him to Liberia. While in Liberia, this\nlittle African nation that was created by the United States, and still had deep ties\nto the United States, he looked at the deep sea port that the US had created\nduring world war II, and his wheels started turning. He returned to the United States and quickly stepped down\nfrom his role as a diplomat. Harry Truman like really wanted him to stick around as a diplomat, but he had actually a very\nstrong reason to leave. Truman said that he had\nan earnest insistence to go do his own thing. This guy was a diplomat, but\nhe was also a businessman, and what he saw during\nhis visit to Liberia, revealed a business opportunity that he just could not leave on the table. So over the next year,\nthis ex secretary of state started scheming with\nthe Liberian government. And in September, 1947, he came out and announced that\nhe a private American citizen had made a deal with\nthe Liberian government. He created a company, an American based company,\nbased here in Virginia, that was to be the exclusive middleman between any international corporation and the government of Liberia. Basically, if anyone wanted to set up\ntheir corporation in Liberia, they would have to go through\nthis guy and his new company. He helped the Liberian\ngovernment craft laws that would make it very attractive, for people to put the\nLiberian flag on their ship or on their company, and\nover the next few years, this gained major traction. At this time, any shipping\nvessel that had the American flag or the Soviet flag, would be subject to a\nbunch of trade barriers, that were starting to go up as\na part of this like cold war between the US and the Soviets. This ex secretary of\nstate and his new company, would go around and say,\n\"Hey, put the Liberian flag on your ship, and now you can trade with\nwhoever the hell you want.\" The Liberian registry exploded, and now you had ships\nflying the Liberian flag, not having to pay barely any taxes, and not having to obey any\nlaws from the United States, and being able to trade\nwith whomever they want, because Liberia was officially\nneutral in the cold war. The Liberian registry was\nborn and it was the thriving. (upbeat music) So in recent decades, the number of ships that\nregister under the Liberian flag, who never stepped foot\nin Liberia by the way, but have their flag on\ntheir ship has grown. And it has become the\nsecond most common flag on international ships in the\nworld, only second to Panama. Meanwhile, the company here in Virginia, who has a monopoly over this\nregistry is getting super rich, and they're giving some of those riches to the Liberian government. But what the librarian\ngovernment does with that money is actually, probably\nthe ugliest underbelly of this whole story. (upbeat music) So by the late 90s this\ncompany's doing great, Liberia is taking in a bunch of money from all of the ships\nregistering under their flag, but then this guy, Charles\nTaylor becomes the president. - How can I help you on\nLiberian shipping registries? It's a long time since\nI've been looking at them. - What has the registry allowed\nthe government of Liberia to do that, that it wouldn't\nbe able to do otherwise? - It was one of the most consistent, dependable sources of revenue\nfor the Liberian government. That was important, particularly in the Charles Taylor period when it was civil war in Liberia, and there were no other\nsources of revenue. It was a war economy. - He starts taking the\nmoney that's coming in from all these ship and\ncorporation registries, but not just to fight these wars, he goes on to commit some\nof the most egregious crimes the world has ever seen. - I was the one myself that investigated the shipping registry. We found, documented, exposed\nthat the shipping registry, that its revenues were being\ndiverted to purchase arms and ammunition in\nviolation of UN sanctions. (upbeat music) - And yet corporations and ships that fly the Liberian flag, don't even have to think about this stuff. They don't step foot in Liberia. They've never met Charles\nTaylor or any of his people, they just go about doing their thing and doing all of their business through a nondescript\noffice, right near my house, where a company is getting very rich using Liberia as the facade, but really everything\nis happening right here. The money is being made right here, and a little bit of that\nis being sent to Liberia, and Liberia is using it\nto do terrible things. Charles Taylor eventually goes to the International Court of Justice and gets indicted on a million\nreally horrible counts, goes to jail for the rest of his life. But the registry that helped\nfund his horrible rise remains, and remains as a mechanism\nfor helping many corporations around the world, hide their secrets and\nevade accountability. And this connection between\nthese two unlikely places, retains a similar purpose\nas its original one. Way back in the 1800s, when with the support\nof the US government, private interests sent away their secrets and their guilt to a far away place. And that hasn't really stopped happening, today with the blessing\nof the US government, corporations continue\nto deposit their secrets in this same far away place, far away from any real accountability. Thank you all for watching this video, this is the type of video\nthat I wanna do more of. A video like this takes longer, it takes more time because\nit's a lot more research, it's more interviews, and actually diving way\ndeeper into these stories than than the typical explainer\nyou see on this channel. And that's what I wanna\ndo starting in 2021, I wanna start doing\nmore stories like this. My patrons make that possible. And brands like Fully who\ncare about this sort of thing, make that possible as well. So, I am hoping that more\nand more we'll be able to do deep dive stories like this. And then when travel opens up, I wanna be able to travel\nand go do deep dive stuff, like I used to do it at box. So thank you all for watching, and I've got some more good stuff coming, and I hope you are having\na wonderful November. I'll see you soon."

    "title": "THE NOSTALGIA THEORY",
    "video_id": "HvN7GxrRtNA",
    "captions": "(static and music going in and out) - I was scrolling back in time recently past the billions of\nlittle moments I've lived, all these photos that I've\ncaptured over the years, and I stumbled upon a\nregion of my photo bank that I hadn't really\never looked at before. It was right here. We had just gotten married and we walked from our little apartment up to the mountain near our house. How are you doing, Is? - Good. - We had no idea if we could\nactually get to the top or how long it would take, but we hiked. We camped at the top\nand we watched the sun fall over the mountain, and I just love looking at these photos. A few weeks later, Is\nsurprised me with a road trip to San Diego and then into Tijuana. - Crossing the border to Tijuana. - I had completely forgotten\nabout this experience. We spent so many hours on\nthe beach playing Frisbee, we ate tacos, we visited old friends. There was this political\nrally that we wandered into. Man, I just, I don't even remember that, and then suddenly I do. That was, quote, \"One of the\nhappiest days of my life.\" Okay. When I look at these\nphotos, at these videos, something happens in my brain. It's like I'm mourning something\nand yet celebrating it too. I've been thinking about\nthis feeling for a while and I've been talking to\nmy friend Nathaniel Drew, who also is very interested\nin investigating this. - So hold on, do you want to, I feel like I'm overthinking this but I want you to be happy\nwith the framing that I've got, at least frame rate. I'm shooting in 24. - As video nerds, dude,\nwe can't help ourselves to talk about composition and\nframe rate right at the top. But yeah, no, I think\nwe're on the same page. - My theory on nostalgia is that nostalgia is\nkind of like fire, okay? And it can be kind of\nlike playing with fire. So fire can, it can warm you up, but you, I feel like you\ncan get lost in it too, staring too long at the\nfire or getting too close, you can get burned. - As we talked, we sort\nof laid out our theories of what's going on here,\nand then we decided how we could investigate this further by experimenting on ourselves. What would happen to my brain if I started listening to music from 2005 and watching old home videos\nand smelling old smells and just sparking that feeling every day? - I may just make a guess here. I do wonder if this will lead to you kind of returning to your\nroots, whatever that means. - So Nathaniel and I set\nout on separate journeys, both of us trying to spark\na certain type of nostalgia in our own way. Nathaniel's goal was to go back in time and start to experience the\nworld in a more analog way without social media and\nphones and et cetera. And for me, the journey\nwas going to be getting out old journals, old books,\nold smells, old music, and cultivating a\npractice where every day, I expose myself to this old stuff and see what that does to my brain. I dived into the neuroscience and looked at the studies\nthat have been done on what happens to the brain. But I also looked at my\nown personal experience and I learned a lot, and\nthat's what I want to share with you today. So I have a theory on how\nall of us experience life. It looks like this. Okay, so you were born here. My theory is that as you grow up, you start experiencing\nthe world like this. This little ring represents the stuff that you're thinking about,\nworrying about, excited about. This ring stretches maybe a few days back and forward in time, maybe a week or two, but not much more than that. If you were living totally\nin the present moment, it would look something like this. If you were constantly\nthinking about everything, everything that has\nhappened over the course of your entire year or your life, the ring would look a lot more like this. But I believe most people's\nconscious experience looks like this, thinking about the good and stressful things that\nhappened yesterday at work or worrying about the\ngood and stressful things that are coming up tomorrow\nor maybe next week. We have a productive day at work, and then you have a\nreally good conversation with your sister on the phone one evening, and then you also get in\na fight with your partner, and I believe that most\nof us use the information in this ring to construct the\ncurrent story of ourselves. In other words, we use\nthis information to decide what we think and feel about\nourselves, who we think we are. But as we move forward,\nthese events will fade and new events will come into the ring and help us construct a new story of who we think we are, what\nwe feel about ourselves. So you're moving along,\nand then one night, something really good happens. You go out with friends, you\ndance, you have so much fun. It's the first week of October and the air is turning cool and crisp. It smells like fall, it\nsmells like the city, it smells like liquor,\nlike perfume, like freedom. You have this one conversation\nthat is so exciting, so inspiring. You feel connected to this\nplace, to these people. And then it's over, and for a few days, you consciously remember that night, you fondly think about it. But a week later, you\nkind of have no reason to think about it anymore. That night sort of starts to fade, those conversations, that\nfeeling, those smells. Those memories are still stored away but your conscious mind has new stuff to put its spotlight on. That night, as a memory, as an experience, gets filed away in some\ndusty file cabinet somewhere in the depths of your long-term memory. And then suddenly, it's\na time in your life that looks so different\nfrom that great night you had with friends. You haven't seen friends in\na long time, you're lonely. You're wondering if you've\neven ever had friends. You're wondering if you're even likable. You're going off the information\nthat's available to you, the stuff that's in this ring, which, on both sides, is full\nof dull, quiet loneliness. But what if somehow you\ncould retrieve that night from the old dusty file cabinet\nin your long-term memory? You dust it off. You maybe edit it a little bit so that it just includes the best parts, and then you bring it forth\nand put it in the ring. Something happens to your\nbrain when you do this. Suddenly you have more information to add to your story about yourself. This information is old\ninformation, but it feels new because you haven't thought\nabout it in a really long time and it challenges your current story, the story about you being\nlonely and unlikable. And in this moment, you feel\ntwo things really strongly. You feel a literal physical warmness, a wonder, a comfort, a\nhappiness in belonging. But the other feeling\nyou get is a yearning to be back in that moment and an acknowledgement that\nit will never happen again. These two feelings are the ingredients for the potent experience of nostalgia. So when neuroscientists look at the brain of people who are experiencing nostalgia, they see something pretty interesting. They see these two spots that fire at once and sort of start talking to each other, a very unique process in the brain. This one is the mind recalling the memory. It's technically called\nchronological remoteness, let's just call it memory. And one is your emotional network, the stuff that makes\nyou feel happy or sad. And during nostalgia specifically, it's firing in the reward centers. The good, the positive,\nyes, brain likes this. These two fire together and\nconnect with each other. It's a strange neural dance between these two unlikely partners of memory and emotional reward. This feeling and reaction is more potent if one, the memory has\nto do with belonging or personal attachment,\nlike friends and family, or if the feeling was a\ncompelling impactful moment in your life that had a\nlot of personal meaning, maybe a big career thing or\na big life-changing moment. And number two, the\nfeeling is more intense the longer it's been since\nyou've thought about it. So like that feeling with\nme on the beach in Tijuana, I literally had not thought\nabout that in eight years. And so looking at those photos, it was a compelling,\npersonal, meaningful moment. My brain was going wild. The studies on this don't\njust look at the FMRIs and the brain and all of that stuff, which is really interesting, but it also looks at what actually happens in the current day life of the person who is experiencing nostalgia. What some of these studies are finding is that nostalgia can actually increase somebody's\npersonal view of themselves, their self-esteem, and it can help combat the effects of loneliness. As I cultivated nostalgia, I really started to understand why that is and how that actually works. I am listening to Weezer,\nto an album that came out when I was a senior in high school, and it is just flooding my\nworld with this feeling. One of the things that\nkeeps coming back to me is the people, the people I was with, like the Friday nights I\nwould have with my friends. The place is there in my memory, but the people I was with, I feel their presence in some strange way as I cultivate these\nmemories, it's really weird. I see their faces, I feel\nlike I'm with them again. It's good and warm, but it's also hurtful. I found myself wanting\nto turn this music off because I was like, \"Oh, I don't want to go there right now.\" It's very, it's very\ncontradictory, these feelings. Anyway, back to it. This is in keeping with my broader theory about the stories we tell ourselves and how the information in our little ring is usually information we use to construct our conscious story, and\nthat introducing old memories that are positive or meaningful\nor tell a different story than your current one can really\nhelp you think differently about who you are and what your life is. Your conscious story becomes\nricher and more flush with good experiences\nand positive information about you and your life. So while I was doing this,\nNathaniel was also doing it on his side, but in a very different way. - We're off to a bad start here. - [Man] Where are we? - I have no idea. We're here actually. The last time I remember ever\neven holding a map like this was with my mom 15 years ago. - Okay, but nostalgia has a dark side too. One of the big takeaways\nfrom the studies on nostalgia find that people actually\nlean on nostalgia during hard times. They'll use it as sort\nof a coping mechanism and this sometimes can\nbe exploited by marketers or in a lot of cases, politicians. - Remember in the old days,\nwhen a crime was a crime? - We will make America great again! - This happens in so\nmany different contexts, to the far right nationalistic\nmovements in Japan that are hearkening back\nto the Japanese empire and how much better it was. You can also look at ISIS and\ntheir focus on hearkening back to the glory days of the old caliphate. It happened here in this country in 2016 with make America great again, hearkening back to some\nill-defined, fake, censored past that never really existed\nbut that helps people who are maybe struggling\nwith changing demographics in the country or losing power to feel like they have\nsomething to latch onto. These political campaigns\nexploit that same brain process that I experienced when\nI look at old photos, but instead they utilize\nit to mobilize supporters. So I did this for a month. I cultivated nostalgia every\nday, listened to old music and read journals and looked\nat old photos and footage, and I can say that I\ndefinitely learned a lot. So during these strange\ntimes of loneliness and non-social interaction, remember that your ring\nis full of information that is not super indicative\nof who you really are. If you're feeling lonely or disconnected, I recommend you experiment\nwith taking the edge off with a dose of nostalgia. I would probably wanna\nmeet one of the guys like Leonardo DaVinci\nthat were really smart and really good at painting. Thanks for watching everybody. This was quite the journey and I have all these journals\nback here, maybe too much. There's such thing as over\ndocumenting, I've learned. So before you go, I want to just tell you about Skillshare, who\nsponsored today's video. Skillshare is a place where\nyou go to learn new skills. I'm a giant fan of online learning. I believe you can open\nso many creative doors if you dedicate yourself\nto taking online classes, that's how I learned all of my skills and Skillshare is a\nperfect place to do that.

    "title": "What People Get Wrong About MASKS",
    "video_id": "5ho3M8i-jXA",
    "captions": "- While I was traveling in New England I found myself surrounded by people. I hadn't been surrounded by\npeople for a very long time and it felt weird, very weird, not least because there's a pandemic\nand there's a virus. And it just was like, is this okay? Luckily we were following all the state and local guidelines, being smart, but I found myself going through this really weird mind process. First being scared that\nI was around people and then being like, oh,\nbut I'm wearing a mask and so it's probably fine. I'm wearing a mask, mask to protect me, but then being like, but\ndo masks actually work? Didn't the CDC and WHO\ncome out and say like, don't buy masks, masks aren't\nthe most important thing here. Which was really annoying that they then reversed their position. Anyway it got me just thinking, what does a mask actually do? And is it actually protecting me when I am around other people? And I did what I always\ndo when this sort of thing comes up and I went on a deep dive. - Put surgical masks on. - And I want to explain to\nyou four major takeaways I've had about masks. By the way, this really cool\ngreen mask that I'm wearing and a bunch of other ones\nthat you'll see me wearing in this video come from\nmy friends over at BioSkin who make really nice, comfortable masks that are breathable and wonderful and I'm gonna talk about them later. For now let's talk about\nthe science of masks. Takeaway number one: your breath is kind of\nlike a rocking chair. - [Man] Ignition. - Bear with me on this one. I promise it will make sense. Watch this guy sneeze. It's kind of gross, but this\nprocess is like a rocket ship for a virus who wants to\nescape the orbit of your body, make it out into space\nand land in the orbit of somebody else's body\nthrough this rocket ship, these respiratory droplets,\nsometimes that stuff lands on surfaces like a doorknob\nand you touch that surface and that's how it makes\nit into your world. Hence the mantra we've\nheard a million times. But as we got into this virus,\nmore and more scientists started to study how the\nvirus actually moves around and they started to say\nwith a loud megaphone as loudly as they could, the virus doesn't just\nspread through droplets. It also spreads through aerosols. And all of us are like,\nwhat the hell are aerosols? And the scientists are like, aerosols are just like the rocket ship, but they're actually more\nlike that little capsule that always breaks off of the rocket ship when all of the fuel\nparts of the rocket ship fall back down to earth. This little capsule keeps\nflying out into space, it's way smaller and it's just floating, not subject to gravity. Okay so back to this guy,\nhe's not even sneezing now he's just talking or\nbreathing and all of this is the aerosols that\nare emitting out of him, propelled in a specific direction. It turns out that even\nafter the droplets fall to the ground and onto surfaces, the virus can stay in their little hatch, these little air cells\nand can float around never falling to the ground. This is really important\nin understanding masks and I will explain why in a minute, but first we have to unpack\na second big takeaway I've learned while looking into masks, which is that number two: the less virus you get,\nthe less sick you get. This is what I think actually most people get wrong about the virus and it's actually something\nthat I did not understand until I delved into the science here. - Still trying to noodle over what the implications of\nthese findings are for masks and which type of masks one needs. - I'd always thought that\nif you catch the virus, you're gonna get sick and how sick you get depends on how good your immune system is. It turns out that's not the case. COVID-19 the disease and all viruses and their effects are not binary. It's not that you just get\nthem or you don't get them. You can get really bad\nsymptoms, sometimes deadly, and then you can have really mild symptoms and you can even have it\nwith zero symptoms at all. And one major thing that determines how bad those symptoms\nare, is your viral load. How much of the virus gets into your body? If a really small amount gets in, it's likely that your symptoms\nwill be very, very low. The more virus you get exposed to the worst your sickness is, this isn't actually a new concept. This is something they've\nknown since the thirties. I guess I didn't know it\nand so I always figured it's an on or off switch. You either get it or you don't and that's just not the case. So yeah, it's a pretty\nsimple thing to understand. I mean, you could go sit through\nthe hour and a half lecture that I did from University of California, or you could even dive into\nthe studies that they did where they put literal masks on hamsters, or you could just take it from me. The less virus you get,\nthe less sick you get. Okay so we have these\ntwo pieces of the puzzle. Number one, the virus can\nbreak away from the droplets and turn into aerosols\nand float through the air and get into your body. And number two, the more virus\nyou get, the sicker you get. Okay, let's put those two together to figure out what masks actually do. So number three, what masks actually do. Once you put on your\nmask, something happens to everything coming out of your mouth. Let's go back to our space\nanalogy for a second. Putting on your mask is like increasing the gravitational force\nof your proverbial planet. Imagine how hard it would\nbe for a rocket ship to escape Earth's gravity\nand get into space if the gravity were five\nor 10 times more intense. So what a mask actually\ndoes is it just increases the gravity of your proverbial planet, makes it a lot harder\nfor something to launch from you into the world. Lots of those droplets\nget caught in the mask so that stops them from even\nescaping in the first place. But the ones that do\nescape and the aerosols that escape from them and\nhave way less momentum, they slow down the trajectory. They create different currents and eddies that keep them in your sphere. So if you're infected and the virus gets out of your body in\none of these aerosols, it's much less likely to spread\nto the people around you. It's just like you have\na bunch more gravity. You can see this with this\naerosol photography technique. The person with the mask is\ntalking just like the person without, their aerosols\nare still escaping, but they get slowed down and they stay within the\norbit of the speaker, as opposed to getting\nsprayed out into the world. Masks help direct the\nparticles in aerosols that make it out of your breath when you are talking or\ncoughing or sneezing. So does this mean that you\nshould only wear a mask if you are sick and you\nhave virus to project out into the world? Which is sort of what\nthey told us at first. Let's be honest. No, it turns out there is\nscience now that shows us what masks do to people\nwho are not infected. Let's talk about that\nsecond piece of the puzzle that I discovered, which is the more virus you\nget, the sicker you get. Inevitably, some virus\nfrom a droplet or aerosol will make it out of someone's mask. Even if they have a really good\nmask on some will come out, let's say you're nearby when that happens. If you are wearing a mask, there's no way that your\nmask is going to filter out all of those aerosols and\nall of those particles, those particles are too small, they'll slip through your mask, but if you are wearing\na mask, inevitably some of those particles will get blocked leading to less virus\ngetting into your body, which can actually mean\nway less severe symptoms, which could in some\ncases mean saving a life. Even if it's just 50% that gets blocked, that could have a major\neffect on how sick you get. In addition masks protect me from myself. I tend to touch my face like a lot of humans\ndo just subconsciously. When you're wearing a mask,\nyou don't actually have access to the vital parts of your\nface that could let virus in. So if you're touching\ndoorknobs or other surfaces that are communal, you suddenly have a\nblockade from yourself, which leads me to my last\nand most important point, which is that the math of masks is insane. - You really better wear a mask. - So quick recap: masks\nmake the proverbial gravity around your proverbial\nplanet more intense, so that it's much harder for things to escape your orbit and for\nthe wearer who is non-infected, it helps stop some particles\nfrom getting into your system leading to a smaller viral\ndose, leading to less symptoms. So imagine if all of these\nforces come together, you're in a public space and\neveryone is wearing a mask. Everyone is getting the\ngravitational effect. They're getting the filtering effect. They're getting the don't\ntouch my face effect all for themselves and for each other, when this happens\nsomething magical occurs. Aatish Bhatia and Minute\nPhysics did a collaboration on this to unpack the\nprobability math that occurs when everyone wears a mask. - [Teacher] Masks are also\ncomplicated because they fly in the face of our mathematical intuition. - What they show is that\nthere's this multiplier effect that when everyone is wearing a mask, the probabilities of transmission\ngo down dramatically, more than you would ever expect. This helps me understand a major question I had while I've been\nin the COVID-19 data. Mainly when I was working\non the New York Times piece, I was looking at all this\ndata, especially in Asia, a lot of these countries who\nare used to wearing masks like Taiwan or China or Vietnam\nhad really low death rates, even if they had high cases and that's because a lot\nof people wore masks. And so people who did transmit the virus in these crowded places\ngot less dose of it and became less sick and fewer\npeople died because of it. Wearing masks truly does save lives. And here in the United States, if we had taken this seriously and really had solid leadership\non wearing masks 100%, we probably could have\nsaved a lot of lives. So masks are here to stay\nfor the foreseeable future, which is sort of waking me up to the fact that I need a\ncomfortable, effective mask. I don't really have one. I sort of use these like homemade masks. Don't really do the\ntrick for long-term use, which is why I'm excited to be partnering with my friends at BioSkin. This is a company from my hometown. I actually grew up working at this place. They're a company who has\nfocused on materials and fabrics and creating technical\nand breathable fabrics for sports bracing and\nthey've helped innovate in that space and they've created a mask that is breathable and\nincredibly comfortable and comes in loads of different designs. They've run studies on this to find fabric that is breathable, but\nalso effective in filtering. And I got to tell you, I'm very happy with the\ndesign, the breathability. I find myself being able\nto wear it for long amounts of time and not feeling\nlike I want to take it off, which is sort of a dangerous thing when you want to take off your mask. So they're safe and they're\nsnug and they're durable. They're machine washable. They have a little metal thing on the nose which helps keep a really\ntight seal around the nose. Very important. And they come in these awesome three packs that are affordable and durable. BioSkin is offering a 10%\ndiscount to my audience. If you go to bioskin.com/johnnyharris and enter the promo code\njohnnyharris you'll get 10% off. I 100% recommend these. I know this company really well. I've known them for years and I can vouch for the quality of this product. So thank you BioSkin for\nsupporting this channel. Thank you all for watching\nand wear your mask. Oh, and P.S, they also\nhave kids masks too, which is really cool. So I have kids and, okay bye."

    "title": "YOU WONT VOTE",
    "video_id": "tl2SpJ0vBEs",
    "captions": "- You won't vote. You're not gonna vote. - Young voters often being considered politically uninterested. - Young voters here could\nmake a big difference. - You're not gonna vote. Hey, you hear me? Why do I know that? Because, I'm just using\nbasic statistics here. YouTube tells me that 71% of my audience, all of you watching, are between the ages of\n18 and 34 years old, okay? That's me too, I'm 32\nyears old, so whatever. I'm in this demographic. We could also be represented on a graph that shows how many of\nus shows up to the polls every election. Back in the 80's that\nnumber was around 50%, half. And then by the 90's it\ndipped down really low, to like 40%. And then it went up a little, and then in 2016, the last general election, it was 46%. Meanwhile, the older\nfolks are way up here, in like the 60's and 70's. People over 65 have almost\n50% more representation in our democracy, because\nsimply, they show up to polls and they vote. Whereas, a lot of us stay home. But here's what blows my mind about this, as I think about it this year, I was this guy. Like, I was this guy. I was the person who didn't vote. Didn't really think about this as some super important thing. Let's just like rewind at me being this guy, in 2012. Of course, I was on YouTube watching all the celebrities telling me that it's my civic duty\nto go out and vote. - It's only one wrong vote, and that is no vote. - And they would use\nthis weird phrase like, get out and vote. It was like, \"Get out, and vote\". - So, on November 4th, get out and vote. - Why are we saying get out all the time? So weird, like it's, what a weird phrase. We don't use that for anything else. I would hear these celebrities\nand I would kind of roll my eyes. Like yeah, I get it, we're in a democracy, this is important, but, it's not that important. And you know what added to all of this for me in 2012? Is that these ads, these celebrities, they made it sound so easy. Just like, \"Take a couple\nminutes and go vote\". Like, it's actually not that easy. Voting in America requires\na bit of research, and a bit of effort. Not a ton, but more than what a lot of\npeople make it sound like. And this is all made\nmuddier by the fact that every state has specific rules. I was moving around a lot at this time. I was in Oregon, and then I was in Utah, and then I was in Virginia. And every one of these states\nhas slightly different rules on how to register, when to register, how to actually vote. Which is why there's a YouTube channel literally dedicated to how to vote in every state. It requires a tutorial. So yeah, voting requires a little bit of research and effort, and we\nshould be upfront about that. Look at this ranking of 20 democracies ranked by how much young\npeople show up to vote. Of course, up here we have\nthe Scandinavian countries, who has a huge majority of\npeople under 30 who vote. Cool, we get it, Scandinavia, you've figured out how to\nrun countries and societies in a very democratic and\nfunctional way, okay? Let's just, why don't you\nkeep bragging about it? Scroll down a little bit, a lot, and you get to the United States, way down here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what,\nwhat's going on here? Hold on. What is going on? Switzerland is even lower, 33%. Switzerland, my Switzerland? Wait, but I thought Switzerland was like the perfect country. There's gotta be a good reason for this. I mean, Switzerland does\nhave political parties that share power, and so elections aren't\nreally that important, and they have all these referenda, and so. - [Wife] Oh my gosh, just\nadmit that it's not perfect. - I'm just not willing to do that. - [Wife] Okay. - Ahem, you can go back to your computer. I need to take a break, and tell you about today's sponsor, for a minute, to sort of refresh. Today's sponsor is SimpliSafe, which is kind of a cool thing. This box arrived at my house, I opened it up, and it was a bunch of security stuff. All of these things that um, I've never really had before. I guess I've always associated\nsecurity system companies, with being these sort of sleazy salesmen that show up to your house, and make you sign all these contracts, and before you know it, you're like in a five year commitment. This was like the\nliteral opposite of that. It was a box that showed up to my house, there was no drama,\nthere was no commitment, there was no signing. I have a studio that has\na bunch of gear in it, and I've always sort of\nin the back of my head wondered like, should I\nhave a security system? And I've thought yes, but the problem is it's always been sort of intimidating for me to think about how to even do that. SimpliSafe is very easy solution for getting security into your home in a very non-threatening way. What I like about this, is that it's incredibly accessible. It takes less than an hour to set up. You can put sensors on whatever\ndoors or windows you want, or think are necessary. You can put up their HD\ncameras wherever you want, the motion sensors. You can just customize it. You don't need some salesman or technician to come out, and like, soup up your house, you can just do it yourself in an hour, with these really easy to use tools. That's a big selling point for me. No commitments, or contracts, or anything. It's just really nice to use technology, that helps secure your house 24/7. Once it's set up, it has an automated feature\nthat calls the police if there's any breaches\nin your security system. These products have won awards, and I'm not surprised why, they're just really useful so, there's a link in my description that when you click, it helps support this channel, but it also helps you learn\nmore about SimpliSafe, and how you can get a\nsecurity setup for yourself. So, go click that link, and go check it out. Thank you, SimpliSafe. Okay, let's get back to voting. I'm still not very happy about the Switzerland flex\nover there from my wife. - [Wife] Just admit that it's not perfect. - Okay, so back to voting. Less than half of people\nunder 30 don't vote. And what does this actually\nmean for our society? Well, it means that older people have way more representation to elect other older people, who have different\nperspectives and priorities than younger people do. Tax cuts for rich people, who tend to be older people, check. They usually don't want\nthings to change very much, because they've sorta\nbeen doing it the same way for so many years, check. The changing climate, yeah, they certainly care\nabout climate change, but like, they're not\ngonna be on the Earth for that much longer. So, it's like they don't actually care, they don't have skin in the game with the climate change thing. This is why one election expert said that, if younger people showed up to the polls in the same proportions as older people, it would fundamentally\ntransform American politics. But wait, let's go back to 2012 Johnny, and go through another\nthing that was in his head. Because, one of the big things, is I was living in Utah at the time. Which is a deeply red state that was definitely\ngonna go for Mitt Romney, and I was an Obama person. And so, I was thinking, my vote doesn't count. Which is actually a very\ntempting line of thinking, and probably a major reason\nwhy a lot of people don't vote. But now that I have studied a\nlot of different governments, and how things work in\nthe world, I realize that that line of thinking is totally wrong. First off, there are loads\nof people on that ballot that are not running for president, that are running for state, and local, and county positions, that incidentally, have way more effect on your day to day life than the presidential election. Sorry to break it to you, but like, presidential\nelection gets all the limelight and attention, actually probably affects your life a lot less. Anyway. Plus that whole idea of, my vote doesn't count, is not how democracy works. Oftentimes democracy feels like a winner takes all situation, where whoever wins, wins and they do whatever\nthey want, because they won. That's not totally the case. Even if you vote for a losing candidate, democracy is a game of\npressuring and signaling leaders. Lemme explain what I mean. Leaders of course, take note of protests, and petitions, and\nother forms of activism. But the thing they really care about, the thing that really pressures them, is the vote. Because that is the only\nthing that can actually lose them their jobs. Even if your candidate loses, let's say you are a red\nperson voting in a blue state, or a blue person voting in\na red state, or whatever, the winner of that\nelection will still note the results of their opponent. If there's a huge turnout\nfor your candidate, even though they lost, the winner of that election will notice, and they will take note, and they will factor\nthat into their behavior, and to their decision making. That is a fact. That is how democracy works. Because they need to keep an eye on it, because they realize that\nif there was a big turnout for their opponent this time, they need to keep an eye on that, for the next election. On the other hand, if you don't vote and you stay home, that candidate who won, has zero pressure. They feel zero pressure\nto behave any differently, because they won so comfortably. Voting isn't just about\nvoting for the winner, it's about signaling to everyone, what the actual political diversity is, in your city, or your county, or your state or your country. Your vote actually does matter, even when it feels like it doesn't. And this took me a while to like, actually accept, but now I see it very clearly. Not only in our democracy, but in democracies around the world. Okay, I know I sound like I'm sort of getting all lecturey here, there are a lot of really\ngood, rational reasons why young people don't vote. Often, we have less flexible jobs, so it isn't easy for us to\ntake time out to go vote, and it can cost us a\nlot of money to do that. Often we haven't made a habit out of it. People that are over 65 have\nbeen doing this for a while. They've had time to develop the habit, and get used to the experience of voting, and honestly, that positive association of going to the polls, voting, feeling good about it, and then the next time you're like, \"Oh I wanna do that again\". Young people haven't had the\nexperience of doing that yet. And listen, I don't think this\nvideo's gonna suddenly change this line, and just\nhave it start to go up, and suddenly we have a 70%\nturnout for young people, though that would be really like psh, change our entire country. But I do think something is changing. I think us young people are realizing that a lot of real, serious threats are being created and\nexacerbated by the old folks that have been running things\nfor a really long time. And that those threats could\nactually have huge affects on our future, and our\nfuture job prospects, what our society looks like. And I think we're realizing that yeah, even though you have to\ndo a little research, and that voting laws\nare a little different in every state, that\nit's worth the effort. Even if our candidate loses, to send a signal about what we want and what we care about in our democracy. (upbeat music)"

    "title": "The US & Canada\u2019s Only Border Dispute Over Land",
    "video_id": "ROIK9_zh5Ts",
    "captions": "(upbeat music) - So while I was on this\nroad trip headed North, we got into New England and everything started to look like this. (upbeat music) There was Fishing Towns, there was loads of clam\nchowder everywhere. There were cliffs and\nboats and lighthouses. This village is so cool. But wait, this isn't a family\nvlog that we're doing here. You saw the title, we're\ntalking about a border dispute. So yeah, while I'm on this\ntrip, I do what I always do, I look at the map of where we're going and I sort of start to explore and being the person that I am, my attention always drifts away from the actual road trip\nroute and starts focusing on this weird line up here. These are the lines we\nuse to draw countries. We call them Borders. And man, the number of hours\nI've spent tracing these lines on a map just looking\nat them, following them, looking for, nothing just looking, seeing what shaped this\nimportant imaginary line takes. Most of the time it's pretty predictable, a river or a straight line\ndetermined by some treaty. But as I traced this US Canada Border, the border that frames the State of Maine, I eventually started to\nget into the ocean where this border line on Google\nMaps runs into a hard stop right here off the Coast of Maine. When I see something like this, my curiosity wheels just start spinning and I can't not look into it. (indistinct voices) - What is this? A freak out? - And it turns out that this line that looks like the end of something is actually just the beginning. Two lines, two different claims. This is the story of a little rocky island with a solitary lighthouse. It's the story of Canadian\nand American fishermen looking for lobsters and\ncompeting with each other. It's the story of Puffins and Tourists and Donald Trump's Foreign Policy. This is the story of the one territorial border dispute\nbetween the US and Canada. - [Expounder] This area has\nnever been properly surveyed. It's as far as who owns what. - [Man] We don't wanna do\nthis, we have no choice. (dramatic music) - This is the longest Border in the world. And it's not really full of much drama. If you rewind a bit, you'll see that this whole area was claimed\nby the British Empire. There was no Canada, there\nwas no United States. But eventually the\nBritish settlers down here decided to rebel from the Empire and start their own country. The British conceded all of this land to the new United States of America. Fast forward 100 years and\nyou now have the country of Canada and the border\nthat we know today begins to take shape without too much conflict. But over here in the ocean,\nthere were some problems. The treaty that the\nBritish had signed with the Newly Independent\nAmericans had said that the United States could claim, any territory that was South of this river and that was within 20\nleagues of its coast. There was this one\nisland over here called, Machias Seal Island, which\nwas well within the claim of the United States based on this treaty. But the British up here, which\nwere soon to be Canadians, referenced an even earlier\ndocument that said that they owned any island that\nwas within six leagues of their coast. So if you look at that island, you can see that there are\nsome overlapping claims. Both of these documents\ngave this one island to both of these countries. These conflicting treaties\ncaused all sorts of Border issues in the ocean, up in New\nEngland off the Coast of Maine. But no one really cared because there was nothing valuable about\nthis piece of ocean. Not unless you fast forward\n100 years to the 1970s. (upbeat music) So it's the 1970s and the\nUnited States and Canada are realizing that this piece of ocean is actually pretty valuable because it has mineral deposits that\nthey want to extract. So they take their dispute to the International Court of Justice, which is in charge of\nworking out border disputes, especially in the ocean. They both submit their claims and over the next like five years the International Court of Justice does potentially the most\nboring work in the world, looking at so many measurements\nand so many different charts and maps and treaties to determine where this border should be. And by the mid 1980s, they settled on a clean, nice, border\nthat looks like this. Until it got right here. This is the area surrounding\nMachias Seal Island, a tiny rocky island that\nboth countries claim. There was no known minerals here. There was nothing valuable. All there was was this old lighthouse that the British had built in the 1800s and that the Canadians inherited. So the borders here\ncontinued to look like this. This is called the Grey Zone and it is the one territorial border dispute between the United States and Canada. Wait, wait, wait, pause,\nlook at this clip, I did not shoot this clip myself. Didn't go into the middle of the ocean to get this random clip. Instead, I downloaded it from Storyblocks, who is the\nsponsor of this video. And who I'm going to tell\nyou about for a minute, before we continue on our journey about this weird border dispute. Storyblocks is a place where\nI get loads of footage. Lots of the footage\nyou've seen in this video, came from Storyblocks because even though I was traveling up in New England, I was not deep in the\nAtlantic Ocean with my drone. But luckily, thanks to Storyblocks, I was able to go on and find\nlots of really solid footage that helps make stories\na lot more visually rich. I've used Storyblocks for\nlike five or six years, long before they ever came to sponsor me. I've used it for a lot of other projects for borders and lots of other things. And I can't say enough\ngood things about it. It is a giant repository of\nhundreds of thousands of assets, not just footage, but also\nAfter Effects templates, sound effects, it's just\na huge amount of stuff that you can use to\ncreate beautiful video. The other thing I love about\nit is that it's a subscription. So you pay one monthly\nsubscription and you get unlimited downloads of\nthis high quality footage. So you can like download\nlike as many clips as you want and you pay the same price, which is really nice. If you are a creator of any sort, even if you don't do this professionally and you want to practice and learn, Storyblocks is a great\nway to get your hands on high quality footage\nto use in your projects. Go to STORYBLOCKS.COM/JOHNNYHARRIS. It's a link in my description. When you click that link,\nit supports this channel, but it also helps you\nlearn more about how to get in on all this amazing\nfootage and different assets. Thank you Storyblocks for\nsponsoring this video. And now back to the story. (suspenseful music) Okay, so you have this sort\nof bizarre border dispute between the US and Canada. But there aren't any natural resources for anyone to actually care about this. But that quickly starts to change. As I drove North into New England, I became familiar with a natural resource that is actually very valuable. And that would turn this\nrocky lighthouse Island into an actual conflict. And that resource looks like this. (bright music) - [Man Two] This is lobster meat. It comes from a lobster that lives at the bottom of the ocean and\nthe people catch around here and bring to my roll. - Lobstering is a big deal in Maine, like a 500 million dollar big deal. It is the number one export\nof the state and Maine, takes in more lobster than any other state in the United States. And now surprisingly, it\nis a big deal in Canada who also has a giant lobster industry. This Grey Zone, the disputed\nterritory in the ocean straddles the fishing zones\nbetween the two countries. So right now, this is really\nthe crux of the conflict. You have a growing lobster\nindustry on both sides with independent Lobstermen trying\nto maximize their catch and going into the Grey Zone. The problem is that Canada\nand the United States have different rules\nand regulations around when you can fish, how much you can fish. But when they get into the Grey Zone, a lot of that sort of goes out the window and it leads to some major conflict, some deep resentment\nbetween the Lobstermen and overfishing of this delicate Ecosystem. - [Narrator] We've had people shot over lobster fishing complex, you know, and significant violence over lobster fishing. - So I guess the big question is, who actually owns this water?\nWho has the more legit claim? At the heart of the Canadian\nclaim is this light house. This light house was built\nby the British in the 1800s. But the Canadians inherited it and they've occupied it ever since. When you're disputing\nover who owns what land having physical\ninfrastructure on that land is a pretty decent claim. And even though light houses\nhave become totally automated, meaning they don't need\npeople to run them, the Canadian Military has insisted on keeping a person there 24 seven. They will helicopter out\nsomeone and their family to man this lighthouse at all times to make sure that there are people there. Not because anyone needs to be\nthere to run the lighthouse, but solely because they\nwant to beef up their claim that this island and the\nsurrounding water is theirs. If you want to see a glimpse into the day of the life of the person\nwho unnecessarily mans this random light house on a tiny island, there's a really\nbeautifully shot short film by a channel called \"Jungles in Paris.\" Which gives you an idea\nof what this life is like. - [Light House Keeper]\nInstead of being the keeper of the light house here you more of the keeper of the island. - Meanwhile, the US basically\nsays all of this is bogus. That the island is rightfully theirs, the fishery around the\nisland is rightfully theirs, it has been since 1782\nand they do not recognize any sovereignty of Canada on this island. The local fishermen and\npopulation in Maine also are very vehemently attached to the\nUS claims on this island. There was this guy, his\nname was Barnabas what? Bartnad, Barnabas? - Barna Norton.\n- Barna Norton. - Barna.\n- Barna. - Barna Norton. who would show up every year on the island with an American flag\nto plant it to assert the sovereignty of the United States. - [Barna] So again, in front of this sign, I declare this island\nbelongs to United States. - And just remember,\nfor the people in Maine, this is not about Geopolitics. This is about their livelihood, the future of their livelihood\nof their number one export a huge part of their\nlifestyle and their economy. And it's the locals who are\nthe most active in this fight. The US government, from a Federal\nor State Department level, kind of doesn't really\ncare most of the time. And meanwhile, while all of\nthis lobster drama is happening, you have boats from both\ncountries bringing tourists onto the islands to look at Puffins. So let's just get up to\nspeed see where we're at. We're talking about these\nvaguely worded treaties that lead to a territorial dispute that\nno one really cared about until they did because of lobsters. And then Canada put a\nperson in this lighthouse even though this lighthouse\ndidn't need a person and then there's puffins. Can you see now I'm\nlike way into the story? Okay, so now let's talk\nabout Donald J. Trump. (sighs) I know, okay. It turns out that this obscure,\nsmall scale border dispute is like click bait for Donald Trump. I mean, think about it. This is a valuable American industry that is being threatened\nby outsiders coming in and stealing our goods. It's just like, just perfect for him. This is an opportunity\nto show American power. - The Canadian government\nis investigating reports. Canadian boats have been\napproached and question by US border patrol agents\nat the Gulf of Maine. The US officials claim\nthey were looking for, illegal immigrants and the\nborder officials have stopped at least 10 fishing boats\nin the past two weeks. - So in 2018, the Trump\nadministration sends out Border Patrol into the Grey Zone to stop Canadian Lobstermen and interrogate them. They stopped 10 different\ncrews and asked them about drugs and immigration. It's just like, come on dude. It was such a Trump thing to do. It wasn't like let's have some overtures for some diplomatic conversations about how we can actually resolve\nthis border dispute peacefully. It was like, send in the Border\nPatrol and intimidate them and show them how strong we are. - What's going on over here? - [Commentator] Hey look at this, Donald Trump, Donald Trump. (crowd cheering) - [Commentator Two] The hostile\ntakeover of Donald Trump. - So fast forward to today. It's 2020 and we're in an election year. And when I say that the\nUS government doesn't care about this border dispute,\nthe caveat to that is during an election\nyear, suddenly they care. (upbeat music) Because the people of\nMainecare and the people of Maine who care also vote\nand you get the picture here. The Senator from Maine,\nSusan Collins wrote a letter to the Trump administration. And she was like, Thanks so much for sending your like badass Border Patrol out to\nintimidate the Canadians. It didn't really do anything,\ncan we actually find a useful, enduring solution to this conflict, through, you know diplomacy? She mentioned that the\nGrey Zone is home to this valuable part of the\nlivelihood of people in Maine and asked the administration\nto actually do something. Meanwhile, Trump has shown a\nstrange interest in this issue. He actually went to Maine\nand hosted this round table with a bunch of people\nfrom the fishing industry. And he brought up the Grey Zone. - How did you let that, how\ndo they let that happen? - [Man] Obama just used it. - That was President Obama.\nThank you very much. - So this meeting ended\nup being Trump going up to basically rally these\npeople and be pissed off with them about how\nthey're being screwed out of their lobster. - You got to be kidding.\nIs that right? - [Man] That's correct, Sir. - So they just closed it\nthey said you can't fish. But let me guess other countries do right? Yeah, they do. - And then of course, he\nfollowed his standard script and basically mentioned how great is. - [Donald Trump] You\nso lucky I'm president, you are so lucky. I don't even know you\nand you are so lucky. - So the upshot here is\nthat Canada cares a lot more about this sovereignty claim\nthan the United States. Unless it's an election\nyear, in which case, US politicians will do some little things to curry favor among Lobstermen. The US doesn't really\ncare that much about this, not nearly as much as\nCanada does who actually uses their military\nresources to man this island. This dispute and the status\nquo is likely to stay sort of as it is unless of course, they discover a legitimately\nvaluable resource like oil or some other very valuable thing. If that were to happen I think the US from like a foreign policy\nstandpoint would step up to the plate and actually wage this war. So for now, the lighthouse will continue to be unnecessarily manned by a Canadian. The Lobstermen will keep\nfighting and overfishing in the Grey Zone and\nboats from both countries will continue to cut out loads of tourists to take pictures of Puffins.

    "title": "Why New York City is so Huge",
    "video_id": "McLgpck2i7A",
    "captions": "(machine clicking) - We made it to New York City. (light music) Every time I'm in this city, I find myself asking the same question. Why is this place so giant? Why does NYC feel like the\nepicenter of the world? (light music) - This city, are you kidding? - Back in the 70s, The New\nYorker magazine made this map, showing how New Yorkers see the country. I grew up in rural Oregon and so this map sort of resonated with me. I felt like New York had\nthis outsized presence in our country, that everyone thought that the United States was New York, like it had some sort of\nhuge poll on everyone's mind. And when I say huge, I don't mean the eight and a half million people that are packed into this city. I also mean the outsized\ncultural gravity of this city. \u266a New York, New York \u266a - It seems like every other\nmovie I watch, or book I read is somehow connected to New York City. So as we biked around this\ncity and had socially distanced hangouts with our friends, and as we ate the delicious things\nthis city has to offer, I started to go down this rabbit hole of how this city came to be\nand how it became so damn big. - [Man] This is New York,\nthe world's largest city. - So I've boiled it down to three reasons, the three reasons why New York\nCity is so big and important. Number one, water. (moderate music) Let's look at a map real quick because, you know, I like to look at maps. The growth of New York\nCity is primarily a story of perfect access to water. Look at where it is compared\nto the Atlantic Ocean. It's not right on the ocean,\nlike it's not a beach, you've got this nice long\nisland called Long Island protecting it from the\nelements and from invaders. Zoom in and you see that\nStaten Island is also here to protect this city\nfrom the wrath of the sea or from conquers, and yet Manhattan is just this tiny skip away from the ocean for any boat fairing person\nwho wants to come and go. Plus, these waters are super\ndeep, creating nice deep ports which don't freeze during the winter. They allow for loads of traffic from bigger and bigger boats. The first Europeans to\narrive and settle this land were the Dutch, who were no strangers to the economic advantages\nof controlling water. In fact, I made a whole video about how the Dutch are obsessed\nwith controlling water. So anyway, the Dutch arrive and they see this prime piece of land and they're like, \"Yep, this is a sweet piece of land. \"We need this piece of land, let's name it \"after our favorite city back home \"that also has amazing access to water.\" And New Amsterdam was born. (moderate music) The Dutch taking over this piece of land is really the beginning of the\nmodern history of New York. And I wanna tell you that story\nbut first, I wanna tell you about today's sponsor,\nwhich is Morning Brew. It is a daily newsletter\nthat you get in your email. It's free Monday through Saturday\nand it is a fantastic way to get informed about\ntoday's business news. I tend to wake up in the morning\nand sort of just roll over and grab my phone and just take\nthe path of least resistance usually that's like opening up Instagram and just sort of\nscrolling to start my day. It's not really the best way to feel good about your morning. What Morning Brew is, is a\nbetter way to start your day. Morning Brew is a digest\nof the most relevant and interesting news in\nbusiness, finance and tech. Morning Brew does not focus on politics. It's accessible, it's like\nsomeone like me who's not like a business insider or\na finance guy can read this and feel like I'm more informed about what's happening in the economy and what's happening in big business deals and sports and things that\nI don't follow super closely but feel like I have access to through this really concise newsletter. So, I'm a big fan of what they're doing. It is free, it happens every\nday, Monday through Saturday. There's a link in my description\nwhere you can sign up. Thank you Morning Brew for\nsupporting this channel and let's get on with the story. What are the Dutch up to\non the island of Manhattan. (light music) As always, there were\npeople living on this land who were not really familiar with the concept of owning plots of land, which clearly belonged to the earth dah! And so the Dutch arrive and they're like, \"Oh, so you don't mind if\nwe buy this land from you \"and exploit it to get super rich?\" And so the Dutch paid the natives $24 and now the Dutch begin to\ncontrol this little plot of land that is so perfectly connected to and protected from the water. (light music) They kept the original name\nthat the Algonquian people had given this island\nwhich was Manna-hata. And then they named\ntheir surrounding areas after Dutch names like Brooklyn and Bronx. The British eventually took\nover this piece of land from the Dutch and renamed it\nafter one of their own cities, that had nothing to do with water, and after a few years\nof settling this land, the British really started\nleveling up when it came to controlling the water. They started navigating up this river called the Hudson River. (moderate music) So that they could connect\nwith the newly constructed Erie Canal, which went all\nthe way to The Great Lakes. (moderate music) And so now you have this one city that has protected access\nto the Atlantic Ocean as well as to the Great\nLakes all through water. Okay, so perfect access\nto water is number one and the main reason why New\nYork City became so huge. Number two is that New York\nbecame the world's factory. (light music) So it's the 1800s, and\nthere are three industries that are really taking over the world. Number one is the mass\nproduction of clothing. Number two is the publishing of books since there's all this\nsciency stuff going on and people wanna write\nit down and publish it, share it and everyone\nwants to get really smart. And number three was\nthe refining of sugar, which European powers were stealing from all over the world to\nfeed the growing obsession with sugar back home. These three have something in common, they require some raw material\nto be shipped in somewhere to be transformed or refined or rearranged and then shipped out as a final product to customers all over the world. To us in the 21st century\nthis seems super obvious that our products would\ntravel around the world to be transformed and manufactured before they end up with us. But back in the 1800s, a global\ninterconnected supply chain was sort of a newish\nthing, and New York City was uniquely placed to take\nadvantage of this new process. To add to this momentum back in Britain, they were kinda pissed\noff that their settlers had declared independence from them, and then had beat them in a war. So as a matter of pride,\nthey sort of refused to trade with any of the major revolutionary cities like Philadelphia or Boston. So this meant that New\nYork City was the place to do global business, and the\ncity exploded with industry. (light music) This boom in factories\nand industrial production is really what built this\ncity, from the actual buildings and infrastructure, to the population, as workers flocked to the city for jobs. Which gets me to my next point. The third and potentially\nmost important element that built the New York City that we know today, is immigration. As this city became the\nindustrial hub for making stuff for people around the world, a steady flow of immigrants started\nflowing into New York City, mainly from Europe at first. Some of them were fleeing war\nor oppression, starvation, and some were just looking for a new life, to take a risk, to try something new. And New York was there to meet them. So millions of immigrants started to flow into New York City, many getting on ships and arriving on this island. By 1860, almost 70% of adults in New York were foreign born, 70%. (upbeat music) These immigrants didn't just fill the jobs of the industrial and commercial\ngrowth of New York City. This influx of immigrants from\nso many different backgrounds began to lay the foundation\nof the incredibly diverse multicultural experience\nthat is New York City today. (upbeat music) But even though they all came\nfrom different backgrounds, they also had one thing in common. Immigrants tend to be a self\nselecting group of risk takers. After all, they made\nthe long arduous journey into the unknown to start a new life. In other words, they're\nnatural entrepreneurs. Look what we found. Best tacos on the East Coast. Coz they just like Tijuana, here we go. (murmurs) - Now let's go to that park. - [Woman] Num-num? - Yeah.\n- So you take a bunch of risk takers and you gather them into one large growing\ncity to build a new life, and that creates a culture of its own, a culture of new ideas, new\nbusinesses, new inventions. And when you have a\nbunch of new businesses and new inventions and new ideas, you often have rich people show up to try to bet on those ideas to see whose idea will actually\nwin, with the intention of making money on a\nsuccessful idea or invention. I'm using a bunch of words to describe the process of investing or finance. For many years in the\nUnited States, the epicenter for banks and lenders was Philadelphia. But as New York City filled up with entrepreneurial\nimmigrants, the epicenter of investing slowly\nshifted to the place where the best bets were happening. And New York City became\nthe financial epicenter. All of the industrial\nproduction and factories eventually went away, but the\nbanks and the stock exchange that were built on its shoulders stayed and became the economic\nfoundation of modern day New York. (moderate music) This explanation of New York\nCity helps me understand the more elusive mystique\nabout this place. And that it's poll isn't just about the eight and a half million\npeople that live here, but that those many people, their stories, where they came from, the\nlives they built here, all from different backgrounds, and yet they were all engaged\nin the same experiment, cramming into this city to build something that had never been built before. - [Presenter 1] New York City\nis as amazing in its own way as the Grand Canyon. - [Presenter 2] New York City.\n- [Presenter 3] New York City. - [Presenter 4] New York City. - So there you have it,\nNew York City is a place that had a perfect\nconnection to the water, that was perfectly placed\nto be the world's factory, as the global economy started to blossom. All of this attracting\nrisk taking immigrants, who built the population\nbut also planted the seeds for the uniquely New York\ncharacter that we know today. (upbeat music)"

    "title": "How The U.S. Stole the Middle East",
    "video_id": "YnOdULpV810",
    "captions": "the middle east the part of asia that europeans see as the middle of what they see as the east sort of arbitrary whatever we call it the middle east this part of the world is literally where civilization started right here in modern-day iraq and over the years the borders here have been redrawn many times as empires have ebbed and flowed through this region by the way i didn't make this time lapse a very talented youtuber did and he deserves a medal for it or perhaps just a new patron thanks man anyway the most recent carving up of this region happened by european powers the french the british the russians i mean are we surprised no like of course of course it was the british of course it was the french of course it was europeans of course the lines they drew didn't really take into account language or ethnicity or regional identity they just sort of sliced it all up amongst themselves and said these are our new regions of power in the middle east eventually those european powers left but the lines they drew stuck around and became the skeleton for what the borders look like today and this is where our story starts in the 1930s here in the modern middle east at this point across the ocean there was this growing superpower that had spent the last century moving west taking over this whole continent and beyond deep into the pacific ocean we've talked about that a bit but things were changing the world had just fought a brutal world war that was fought with new weapons that were powered by this new important substance oil germany lost that war in part because they didn't have access to enough oil to keep up with this new style of warfare that relied a lot more on machines the young superpower realized that access to this stuff would determine who would be powerful and who would not so they stopped looking west for a moment and turned east with hopes of finding the fuel they needed to build their power the us presence in the middle east started with one little dot right here but soon that dot would expand into a sprawling network of alliances covert attacks flows of weapons money and the building of innumerable bases and eventually turning into full-on ground wars this is how the u.s stole the middle east ready and willing to employ all means necessary okay so it's the 1930s and the us doesn't have a significant presence in the middle east at this point but that's about to change because there's a company based in california that wants to explore this vast desert for oil 11 000 miles from san francisco there lies a primeval desert a mass of drifting sand and sun-baked earth one-third the size of the united states this was sort of a risky decision for the california company because first off they had no idea if there was actually any oil here they knew it would mean sinking into the desert the money of thousands of stockholders in a project that might well end in complete loss and second off this desert was a part of a very hardcore religious kingdom the fact that mecca is the source and the shrine of islam gives saudi arabia a central place in the islamic and therefore the arab world that was home to the holiest sites in islam run by a dogmatic royal family that did not like outsiders especially non-believing westerners but even still the king of the desert kingdom eventually gives the california company permission to explore almost a million square kilometers of this desert looking for oil and after a few years the bet paid off and on march 3rd 1938 in this little patch of coastal desert they struck gold well actually they struck oil but it might as well have been gold [Music] so throughout the 30s and 40s american oil executives workers and their families started flocking to the middle east establishing the first significant american presence in the region they set up little cities around the oil operation that were little slices of america full of the deepest sinful behavior like allowing women to drive and the consumption of alcohol here is another american colony complete with air-conditioned houses two hospitals and an outdoor movie theater this is the sort of stuff that is very off limits in saudi arabia it's literally illegal at this point so you have a lot of saudis who are not happy about their government letting the americans in to behave however they want but the oil kept flowing and soon the u.s government goes to the royal family and says listen the oil is flowing better than ever this is awesome how about we build a little military base attached to our little oil city so that we can you know protect you and protect us and protect the oil and stuff and the saudis are like okay um having the great satan come to our country for oil is one thing but letting them set up a full-on military base on our soil and especially when like everyone in our country is not happy with their presence in the first place but said the royal family all of this oil is really valuable and it's really nice and we're getting super rich so they're like yeah sure set up the base but there was one stipulation that the saudis had for the americans you are not allowed to literally plant a flag no flagpoles of the united states you cannot put your flag anywhere on this base instead you can put a little plaque on the side of the building so that your flag is not literally on our soil and that was the deal and that's exactly what happened the u.s sets up its first military operation in the middle east in the form of a landing strip that is right next to this oil field okay so all of this infrastructure that the americans were building required someone to build it they needed a construction company and there was one construction company that the americans really liked that helped them build their oil city and their base this company was founded and run by a guy named muhammad now listen do you think i'm really giving you the backstory on the construction company that built the air base in the oil city just because that's interesting and i'd like to talk about construction no this is actually very relevant to the story and you'll see why very soon so the americans and the saudis are having this forbidden oil bromance and it's going really well and they are just the oil is flowing everyone's getting rich and meanwhile the rest of the middle east is looking at saudi arabia and they're like dude wtf why are you like in bed with america and like why are you letting them set up a landing strip in your country and the saudi royals are like do you realize how rich we're getting right now like if you were in our position you would do the same thing egypt okay so it's the 1950s and let's get back to muhammad the construction guy his company by this point is thriving the american presence in oil land is just exploding and he is building all of the stuff for it and so this guy is just has a giant business and he starts to have children well in fact he had a lot of children like 54 children because he had 22 wives because that is a thing in saudi arabia to this day anyway the point is one of muhammad's sons is named osama i told you this was gonna be relevant okay a reminder that saudi arabia is not the entire middle east so i'm gonna leave the osama bin laden cliffhanger for a moment to tell you what else was going on in the middle east at this time remember that it was the hunt for oil that brought the us to saudi arabia originally but now in the 50s and 60s there was a new reason for the us to think about the middle east and that reason is because there's another big superpower that has nuclear weapons called the soviet union who is coming into the region and saying to everyone come join team communism and the u.s is like hold my beer [Music] so in addition to oil the us is now involved in trying to not let the soviet union have any power in this region over in iran there was a democratically elected leader that the u.s didn't like they thought he was maybe a little too friendly with the soviet union so they worked together with the british to literally overthrow the government of iran so that they could install a dictatorial leader that was more friendly to the united states little side note here the airport that i fly out of here in dc is named after the guy who like gave the go-ahead for this coup in iran john foster dulles so i'm reminded of the whole iran thing every time i fly so the u.s has its oil thing it's now involved in trying to prop up a dictator in iran there's another big thing happening that brings the us into the region which is that the newly declared state of israel is starting to piss off its neighbors and starting to look to the u.s for support and the us gladly offers it seeing israel as a friendly nation in the region that could be a big proponent of u.s interests so the u.s starts to fund israel with tons of money and fighter jets and all of these things to help them fight their wars against their arab neighbors there was a debate happening in the united states on whether or not they should actually do all of this to support israel so intensely because they knew if they did they were going to piss off all of the neighbors in the middle east and all of the neighbors are the ones who had the oil in the end the us did decide to support israel and with that came a major backlash from all of these oil producing countries in the neighborhood there's a crisis of such proportion that we probably haven't even begun to grasp it yet as far as the country is concerned scenes like this are becoming all too common on both sides of the atlantic but for america they are more ominous they tell the arabs that their oil weapon is wounding america the country that supports and supplies their enemy israel eventually this backlash against supporting israel kind of calmed down there was some peace talks and anyway let's get back to muhammad the construction guy and his son osama because this is where it really starts to heat up and it is this world of religious authority and deeply rooted traditions that has now been challenged by the wealth of oil and the western invasion it has brought so it's now the 70s and mohammed bin laden the construction guy is now insanely rich his construction company is giant his 54 children are also rich and his son osama is growing up and he's in his 20s and is looking around at all of this stuff happening in iran and in israel and is starting to feel really uncomfortable with the notion of his family being so supportive of american presence in the middle east and his government this religious kingdom home of mecca and medina being so okay with the us so embedded in the middle east at this point these are ancient holy lands why is my government and my family supporting this great satan superpower coming in and becoming so involved in the middle east so bin laden sets out on a lifelong quest to fight back against these superpowers not just the us but also the soviet union invading the middle east he heads to afghanistan where the soviet union is invading afghanistan trying to take it over bin laden wants to fight back by the way the same year in iran that dictator that the u.s put in gets overthrown in a giant religious revolution that gets rid of the old dictator that the u.s liked and puts in a religious government headed by this guy ayatollah khomeini this new government takes a bunch of americans hostage and starts off hating the united states and i mean can you blame them if someone overthrew the person i elected i would be pretty pissed too so anyway back to bin laden he arrives to afghanistan with a few things number one a bunch of money remember his family is like super rich he also comes with construction infrastructure because he's like a construction guy like his family knows construction and infrastructure building but most importantly he comes with an obsessive dedication to fighting back against any superpower that is invading the middle east so osama joins in with all of these rebel fighters who are fighting back against the soviet union and they fight a long brutal war by the way the u.s was secretly loving this loving that the soviet union was getting like beat back by these like rebel fighters so they end up sending loads of weapons and money and support to these fighters something that will come back to bite them a few decades later eventually osama and the afghan fighters beat back the soviet union it was 10 brutal years of war and by the end these fighters were battle hardened osama was now completely dedicated to his cause of fighting back against superpowers who are coming into the middle east so he returns back to saudi arabia where he starts raising money and awareness for his new group that he started while he was in afghanistan it's called al-qaeda and the mission of the group is to protect islam through violently striking back against big superpowers coming into the middle east and saudi arabia is like osama like do you have to do this dude do you realize how rich we're getting like saudi princes are living on yachts in the south of france and like flying in their private jets and they're like dude chill like it's fine we get it we don't like the united states but like can you like maybe chill our partnership with the united states is actually turning out to be really great and i know yeah they're really into israel and they're really bad and everything but like they buy our oil and they give us weapons and we're like doing just fine over here osama doesn't chill and the saudi government eventually takes away his passport not letting him leave and told him to hush up with all the anti-american holy war talk so osama finds another plan to maybe win back the heart of the royals saudi arabia has a next door neighbor named iraq who was run by saddam hussein who osama sees as a really bad muslim totally secular and brutal and he's just like not a good guy saddam is also cashing in on the oil boom he's building big palaces and statues of himself all over the country oh yeah and he also used the oil money to build a giant army like the fourth biggest in the world with this massive army saddam decided that he could maybe multiply his oil reserves if he popped down to invade this little tiny country of kuwait where there's also loads of oil this sort of freaked the saudis out if saddam with his giant army could grab kuwait what would stop him from marching right across this desert into saudi arabia so there's this moment that like oh it's like the moment of infamy of this whole thing where osama goes to the saudis and he says i volunteer as tribute he doesn't actually say i volunteer and tribute that was a hunger game i believe we have a volunteer but he effectively says i have me and my battle-hardened men who like can go in and fight against saddam and and defend the kingdom and the saudis are like um no we're not gonna like let this ragtag group of like rebel fighters fight off the fourth largest army in the world and osama's like well we beat the soviets like they're a big army with nuclear weapons and everything and the saudis are like yeah because you hid in the hills in caves in afghanistan prince sultan literally told bin laden verbatim quote there are no caves in kuwait and then he asks them what will you do when he lobs the missiles at you with chemical and biological weapons osama's response we will fight them with our faith and the saudis are like um awkward sorry dude like instead the king met with somebody else that he thought would make a much better fit than bin laden and his faith fighters dick cheney had flown to saudi arabia the day after saddam had invaded kuwait at this point the bromance between the u.s and saudi arabia had cooled a little bit as saudi had gotten more and more flack for being in bed with the u.s but even despite this he told cheney to come with as much force and as quickly as he could [Music] and that is exactly what dick cheney did ready and willing to employ all means necessary the us went insane here they recruited 37 other countries and then they sent more firepower in terms of ships and bombers and troops and all this stuff than you and i could ever imagine it was insanity and they totally crushed saddam within a few weeks they had pushed it on back and completely won over the hearts of the royals the bromance is back in business so now you have these saudis that are beaming at the americans for helping them fight off saddam and you have a bunch of bases that the u.s set up to mount this attack way more than before the us came with all of this firepower and manpower and bases and artillery and then they just sort of never left something that really pissed off a lot of saudis who were very uncomfortable with us presence to begin with but the guy who was most pissed off than anyone in the middle east at this point osama bin laden who had not only been rejected by his own country but then who got chosen instead but the great satan the united states a power that osama had built his entire life fighting against so osama bin laden starts to double down on his original mission he leaves saudi arabia and begins coordinating very precise attacks that could really only be coordinated by a guy who was good at technical details of a construction company and who had lots of money to fund it he carries out attacks against the united states all around the world and by the late 90s he starts planning the attack that would change our world forever so this is just the first half of the story what happens next is something that we're all kind of familiar with in fact i think we're all still kind of processing the us presence in the middle east today and how that all went down but it deserves taking a look at and i'm not going to do that right now i want to make a separate video for iraq and afghanistan and israel and iran and dive into each of these cases to show how the u.s presence in the middle east is not just about oil in fact oil is becoming less and less of a vital aspect of the u.s presence as we have alternative sources of this sort of energy instead our presence in the middle east has become a fixture of how we think about foreign policy and how we think about the map it's become so embedded in our military doctrine and in our foreign policy doctrine that it's proving to be really hard to think about how we could ever get out [Music] thank you everyone for watching this video um man middle east the middle east it's a complicated place and this is just a very broad overview and like i said i want to go deeper into each of these case studies because there's so much more to cover with each of these stories anyway that is to come stay tuned for that thank you skillshare for sponsoring today's video big fan of skillshare big fan

    "video_id": "wILAAYhKQnY",
    "captions": "um I don't really know what I'm gonna say I usually script like scripture script write lots of things on the internet but no I just press record so um for those of you who know borders USA the fifth season of borders was uh in production and in fact we shot most of it and developed it and um yet it was in production at a time when everything kind of started to change in this country these things have changed our country fundamentally so borders USA is canceled and will not air as you can imagine this news is very difficult for me um I understand the the reasoning and yet what this represents for me is a very abrupt and unforeseen end to something that I really really loved and really worked hard to build I don't know how to describe this other than borders was more than just a documentary series for me um this project represented a major transformation in my life and became the foundation of so much of what I do today back in the early days of Vox when it was still sort of a startup and there were just a few of us on the video team my boss at the time Joe who was the head of video took a major chance on me he let me take my camera at that point of 5D Mark III and my tripod and The Limited budgets we had back then and go my first time was to Cuba and he just said make it good and make sure it's factually accurate that opened something in me that I didn't really know existed which was this obsessive voracious desire to tell stories and explain things in Far Away places Joe let that spark catch and over the next several years that spark turned into a massive fire and I'm looking for ideas surrounding a single topic borders by 2017 we turned it into a series called Vox borders we're driving through a river right now in the Jeep I traveled to six different border regions around the world in one summer in the course of 40 days and the whole time I was pinching myself is this a dream am I really in a Jeep in Nepal going up to the Tibet border to tell a story of nomadic Yak herders am I really in a North Korean School in Japan eating kimchi and rice and talking to these people about their love for their great leader back in North Korea did I really just take a nighttime boat ride with a bunch of merchant women from Haiti to the Dominican Republic it was a whirlwind of experiences and a master class in how to tell stories and represent people and represent big issues around the world I am incredibly grateful for that first season it went on to get nominated for an Emmy and fox was like let's do another one and so then it was Hong Kong five really compelling stories from cage homes to feng shui to the story of the British in Hong Kong and the remnants they left behind and then Colombia where we looked into one of the world's most dire border crises as Venezuela fell apart and people rushed into Colombia looked into music and hippos and cocaine and then finally India the most intimidating and difficult set of stories I've ever told hours and hours pouring over physical maps traversing from the south of India where we looked at the Sri Lanka India border all the way up to the north into Punjab the Border ceremony the Sikhs looking across the border at their holy Place learning about cow Vigilantes and the persecution of India's Muslims this is hard like I said this is hard and weird and nostalgic and my whole body feels it in some strange way and yet I at the same time I'm feeling a deep gratitude for the fact that I had this opportunity a gratitude for Christina Thornell who was the first person I hired when we started borders to help me build it and she did and became a Monumental part of the whole thing helping develop the stories and get us in places that were impossible to get into and getting us the interviews we needed and the story beats and the visuals and her work is embedded in every episode and the stories themselves it's so often that I was on camera and like you know doing my thing but there were so many people who touched these episodes and I just feel so grateful especially to the editors if you don't know in journalism an editor is someone who sort of guides you and guides your story and helps you pare it down and helps you focus on the right things and I'm sure many of you know Joss Fong the amazingly talented Video Creator her guidance over the years made me who I am as a Storyteller every video you see on this channel has Joss Fong's fingerprints on them she taught me how to be a journalist and and I am forever indebted to her as a Creator and as an editor and as just a person thank you Joss you may have noticed that borders got more rigorous and like deeper each season and that's because we got a new story editor Mona who came in and said like hey what if we made borders like a hard-hitting like journalistic series that was like deeper and more representative of people and she became my story editor and pushed it and really taught me what like serious journalism was and there are so many people who touched this series from assistant producers to our engagement team at Vox who helped push it out to the world I would love to talk about every person who touched borders and I and I did in a slack message to my team as I was leaving and shutting down everything at Fox's one of the things things that became really special for me was the music in borders [Music] starting in Hong Kong I started teaming up with a music composer Tom Fox who started building custom music for every episode of borders guy's amazing and luckily I still get to work with him he still makes music for this Channel and for my other work and he's just one of the most brilliant musicians I've ever had the pleasure of working with [Music] and I will probably work with him for decades to come so check out Tom Fox's music for sure Link in the description while I am very sad that these stories that we worked very hard on will sit on a hard drive somewhere for the rest of time I am very grateful for the opportunity I had to work at this place and the people I got to work with sad nostalgic part over what's next for me foreign I'm gonna keep making YouTube videos I'm now officially like a full-on YouTuber this will start to really take a lot more priority in my life right now the channel is not big enough that I can go out into the field and do documentary stuff but the way it's growing it may be big enough that I could actually financially support that so if you're not subscribed click subscribe it helps me uh grow so I can do more ambitious stuff go to patreon.com Johnny Harris and you can support and get a bunch of cool stuff if you do it too all of that will help me make more ambitious videos and be able to eventually do more sort of journalistic style stuff right now it just doesn't make sense financially number two I'm Gonna Keep focusing on the startup that I've been building for the past year which is called bright trip where we've built a platform where we publish travel courses how to go on a trip and have it be way more informed it's all with beautiful video and animation and teaching and all of this stuff so that's the other thing I'm going to continue to work on number three I'm still going to be in the journalism world I reached out to the New York Times who I've talked to for many years and said like hey do you guys want to collaborate on something so I've been working with the New York Times which is a really fun and amazing opportunity and we'll be publishing a video with them sometime in the near future so I'll still be doing journalism in the end the thing I care about most is again what I talked about what I learned at Vox which is this love I have for sharing stories about how the world works and specifically about how things work in Far Away places that we're not maybe familiar with I find great meaning in that and what all of these things have in common the YouTube channel brighttrip the journalism stuff is that I want to share stories and information in beautiful ways with you and that's why I do this that is what my work is like I said that's something I learned at Vox because they took a bet on me and I'm so grateful for that and it's something I'm going to continue to do on all of these different platforms so thank you all for being here and for those who have been on the borders journey and along with me thank you for all of the support throughout these years it's been good and it's not over this is just a little fork in the road I'm not going anywhere I'm gonna keep telling stories one way or another and I hope you all can continue on the journey with me see you later foreign [Music]"

    "title": "You Ask, I Answer | Q&A",
    "video_id": "iXLfXm0QTkE",
    "captions": "i am setting something up for you the head is just cut off i'm doing a q a you're gonna do such a good job you're funny and you're fun and you're awesome and you're the best i just want to make map videos all right let's do it i've got lots of just images look at all these images one of my big favorite things to do in my whole life is to just surround myself with visual cues and markers that like remind me of good things usually memories i am a little obsessed with documenting and then like forcing myself to like be inundated with all those things like this cool picture of a boat i took this on a film camera and it is a boat going around a lake in italy me and izzy when we were first getting started in our studio my child out of focus one of my favorite villages in the world in switzerland switzerland switzerland and then this big boy this is a beach in portugal and henry right there just good moment the other thing i do is maps wait this guy likes maps i found this old national geographic switzerland austria italy i mean does it get any better one thing i like to do with these old maps is look at the stroke of the lines here and like how the style of them you'll see on this that they have a thick line and then they have sort of like a feathered off thinner line at all the borders and it gives it this glowy effect that's like really elegant it's just beautiful here's a map of africa in 1860 looks very different maybe i should make a video called how europe stole africa anyway i'm just hanging photos and thinking about the studio and how it's changing and we've been here about a year and a half now it's been great all right hi everyone i'm not making map videos today while i am over there but i'm taking a moment out to answer some of your questions because i get a lot of questions and i feel like every once in a while it's a good idea to come here and just like answer all of those questions let's do it what is your current favorite breakfast man breakfast i have a whole new breakfast life now and it is wonderful i have started to eat yogurt and granola uh is made granola look she made this granola and i've never really been into granola but then she made this and it's like excellent so i've been eating that i've been eating a lot of salmon and rice though i find that i can't do that every single day i have to sort of pace it out a little bit you just can't have salmon every single day i mean some people can but i've also been getting like instant soup cups and putting boiling water in and then cracking an egg and then cutting up some avocado and eating that for breakfast i guess like the theme here is i just like savory things for breakfast what is your favorite border region in the world that's a tough question man i don't know about favorite but at least like the most engaging or like the place i think about the most is the border of china and nepal it is just up there in the high mountains and it is one of the wildest weirdest places i've ever been on up on the tibetan plateau so it's very flat but you're really really high up um it just has a special culture to it it's very remote it takes forever to get up there it's a pretty magical place you should explore this on a map it's really interesting to look at this landscape on a map if you look up a place called lomantan in northern nepal you will see a wonderful place um are there any cultures your children have naturally gravitated towards yes actually yes so for those who don't know we used to travel a lot with our children obviously we don't travel right now with our children because no one travels but we've taken them all over the place i think they've been to like 10 countries and for context i hadn't left the united states until like i was a full-fledged adult like i didn't start traveling so like my children at the age of like three had been to more countries than i had by the time i was like 25. our youngest oliver who's four years old loves japan he loves japan he loves the robots he loves the noodles he loves udon noodles like big long squishy noodles he loves the trains and we went to like a like a kids like theme park roller coaster thing in tokyo and he just like fell in love he just loves japan oh and his favorite food is teriyaki chicken which he he calls it teriyaki chicken i want teddy yucky chicken it's so cute melt my heart my other son henry who is seven loves trains trains trains trains he's obsessed with trains he knows all about trains and he therefore is really into switzerland switzerland yes so now there are two of us in the family who love switzerland so japan and switzerland two places i'm very happy my boys love oliver also by the way uses chopsticks like he like i got him some like chopsticks they're both left-handed so we got into like left-handed chopsticks and he is just so cute with those i love it keep going here more questions more questions do you ever feel like what you're doing is not enough if so how do you cope with that whoa yeah 100 i definitely feel like what i'm doing is not enough always and i think i'm not unique in that i'm pretty sure human beings are programmed to constantly feel like they need to be doing more i think it's probably a survival thing built into our software uh where we feel like unless we are maximizing everything to like earn or do all the things we're not like protecting our uh tribe i don't know i don't know how it works like evolutionarily but the fact of the matter is even when i'm having success even when i am uh being super effective and fruitful in my work i still feel this sense of i need to be doing more i'm constantly not doing enough and i think our economy has optimized for that like we're constantly pushing humans to like the maximum we can get from them in a five-day workweek and it sucks it sucks because i know that like i know it in my mind but yeah i still can't counteract that and say like it's enough things are good i'm working on that i'm working on sort of rewriting that that software in my brain to think differently about what i need to be doing okay what else do you have plans to travel to the philippines yes philippines philippines like i want to go there so bad on bright trip we're talking about a course in manila with a creator who's there and it's just getting me like really excited uh about the notion of traveling to the philippines someday where do you learn to edit like you i learned to edit over many many years just practicing that being said on bright trip i think we're probably gonna eventually do a course that's like professional post-production fundamentals and it'll be me teaching everything i know about basic animation and editing and storytelling in a post-production standpoint so we have camera fundamentals now and i i think we're probably going to push a more in-depth shooting fundamentals and then post-production fundamentals it's part of this broader goal i have to sort of teach everything i know about this craft including journalism and storytelling and research and writing all of that um on bright trip not gonna be doing that tomorrow but that is in the works and you can always sign up for the bright trip newsletter if you want to sort of be informed on that you also get 20 off your first course purchase if you sign up for that newsletter so probably an important thing to think about okay tell us about your education okay i'll make this quick i have a bachelor's degree in international relations i have a master's degree in international peace and conflict resolution from american university here in washington dc both of those were decisions i made to invest in my what i call soft skills my thinking skills my data skills my research skills my sort of argumentative and writing skills i don't think it was completely necessary meaning i don't think i still think i could do interesting work without having gone to college but college gave me some useful academic skills that i use in all the videos i make what would you say to somebody who wants to start creating video but doesn't know where to start or what to share this is a tough question to ask because i only have my experience to go off of like i started making video really young and just never stopped and so i don't have super clear perspective on your specific situation that being said i know a few key things that i think apply to everyone which is number one the only way to improve is to just start making things and to make a lot of things you have to get a large volume of work under your belt before you start to really see the results you want i mean that's not a novel idea but i think it's important to just say you have to start somewhere you have to start where to start um so here's a quick start guide on where to begin with video find a video that you like what is a video that you like that is really interesting to you and you're like i want to make something like that and then emulate it copy it copy it but copy just some of the elements of it the format maybe the music don't try to copy it exactly but try to use it as inspiration and to dissect it and say why is this video good why do i like it and start to emulate that word is really important you have to emulate if you're going to create your own stuff i emulated a lot of people sort of like taking inspiration from how people did things and that's how i found my own voice pick a topic that you like and then pick a video that you like the format of and then emulate it and start to make something and it's not going to be good at first it's just not it's going to take a while before your videos start to look good that's the journey we all went through all right here is a question i get a lot i'm excited to talk about it which is how do i find and research topics for my videos the answer is i choose the topic of videos based on what i'm genuinely interested in genuinely curious about these videos take a really long time they take a lot of effort and if i'm not like passionately into it then i'm gonna lose steam pretty quickly so i will often be reading books that are sort of topics i'm interested in like international affairs or middle eastern politics or um i don't know like the history of the india partition and i will find bits within that where i'm like wow that is fascinating to me and as soon as i have that i will then start to dive in on reading wikipedia articles wikipedia is like my best friend because wikipedia gives me the building blocks i need to construct the videos i make often books and things like that have like the key details that are like really really interesting but wikipedia gives me the context and the broader story of what it is i'm researching and i'm really grateful for wikipedia anyone who bad mouse wikipedia i'm in a bad mouth you yep all right what is the brand of the leather boots that i'm wearing all the time these leather boots so here's a story i destroy shoes i'm a person who destroys shoes not for fun not because i want to but because i walk in this really intense way that destroys all footwear anything in front of my feet just gets destroyed so i kind of started to get into boots and realized that after about 11 months my boots would start to like just fall apart the sole would start to fall off the threading would start to sort of disintegrate and i got tired of it a couple years ago and i said like there has to be a boot in this world that can like withstand my intense walk and sure enough i went into a boot store in portland oregon of all places the perfect place for this and i asked them and they're like we have the boot for you and they introduced me to a genre of boot that was invented by several companies back in like the 40s at the behest of the united states government who had like jail inmates that needed a pair of boots that the government didn't want to replace every few years they wanted a boot that would last them like 30 years for these inmates have gotten into this boot by wolverine called 5 000 mile boot okay i'm done talking about boots i've been talking about boots way too long that was a deeper rabbit hole than i expected to get into what is your blood type what is the best technique for becoming fluent in spanish man same advice that i would give to someone wanting to learn video you have to immerse yourself in doing it like there's no way especially with a language other than uh immersion here's my analogy ready a classroom spanish or classroom language learning is like learning knife skills if you want to cook you're like okay i can learn how to chop a carrot and you're chopping carrots all day you're like i'm getting really good at chopping carrots and then you're like oh but i don't know how to cook and they're like yeah because you need to actually go into the kitchen and put the carrots in a pot of olive oil and then you need to put celery in and blah blah and you're like no no i'm just gonna be here and chop and like chop all day and i'm gonna get really good at it it's like no you're just learning how to chop you're not learning how to cook like go cook going to a country and feeling the discomfort of immersion and not being able to communicate is like cooking it's not just like learning how to chop i'm kind of proud of that little metaphor i'm gonna like file that away and use that more and more do you have any plans about making videos about india's partition come on really i spent half of my 2019 making videos about india and one specifically about the partition just type in vox borders india and you will see it can you make a video about puerto rico yes totally on the list totally come in man what a wild history what a wild situation puerto rico i got you favorite color green i don't know it just depends on the context but green is there going to be a bright trip app in the future yes definitely i have an interest in maps and about countries like you do but i have no idea what to do with that interest the answer is to just dig in we have the internet for heaven's sake like we have every bit of information we could ever want and it just requires a little bit of searching if you're interested in maps go to the library of congress map room on the internet and look at the beautiful high-res maps that they have go to the david rumsey collection and look at their old maps you need to cultivate that curiosity and luckily you have the world at your fingertips via the internet what's a good starter camera for travel man we just made a course on how to document your travels and i did it all on my iphone more and more it's becoming obsolete what camera you have it comes down to how you stabilize it and what kinds of shots you get like this thing it's got three lenses on it a wide angle let's get everything i need i use this more and more i used to hate when people would say that when i was first getting into this like they'd be like yeah it doesn't matter the gear i'm like yeah it does better camera i'm getting more and more into that uh that gear isn't the most important thing but i hate it when people say that to me so i'm not gonna say it to you even though i just did sorry i'm getting a lot of questions about vox and borders and i will tell you this i will have a very clear update on all of that in the next two to three weeks that is a promise i will give you all the information that i know you will know in two to three weeks any book recommendations oh man i just finished this book educated it was incredible just a really incredible story how are you handling staying in one place for so long this has been really interesting i'll put it that way it's been really good in some ways and really difficult in other ways first off we have it pretty darn good we have our studio and office space here in all of the covid situations we have a pretty darn good setup and i'm grateful for that that being said this is a pandemic and our children aren't going to be in school this fall and we're trying to figure out homeschool and it's just stressful and of course we you know our business relies on travel and so we've had to pivot and there's been some complication to it but amongst all of us there has been a certain quiet and routine settled on our family that has been new for us and it's been healthy and and good and good perspective what it's doing actually is instilling a new appreciation for travel travel is such a resource intensive thing such a privilege and i feel like it was getting really normal and i feel like now i'm i'm re-cultivating that perspective that like oh wow flying on a plane across the entire world is a big deal i should appreciate that a little bit more so i think that's a really good outcome for those probably for a lot of people what are some things that are on your bucket list i don't actually have a real bucket list but i do have some things swirling around my brain that i would probably put on this which is i want to extensively hike in the mountains of switzerland just like go on hikes camp see beautiful peaks find some bunkers for those who don't know what i'm referring to go watch my switzerland video about bunkers in the middle of the swiss countryside it's like my heaven one thing that's really exciting for me is to go on a trip with my like teenage or adult children like once my kids are grown up like i'm really excited to go on even a quiet like fishing trip down the road just to have that experience i think will be really wonderful i want to learn another language in my lifetime um right now i speak spanish and i have a conversational understanding of french and study a little bit of farsi as well but i want to be very fluent in another language i love italian italian is a language that i would maybe want to bite off as like a fourth language to learn i've always wanted and this is kind of a far-flung dream but like a big dream of mine someday is to live in a small town in france and to solidify my french and work in a bakery i love bread it would just be a coming together of so many of my interests to do something like that obviously it's not the time of life like you know i i'm in this other mode of building a family building a life here in this washington dc area but maybe someday in the future what is your favorite episode of borders this changes all the time maybe the hong kong episode one and two together because they're kind of like one big episode split into two basically how the british took over hong kong and then how it was given back and now how china is trying to take over hong kong reporting that story was really impactful for me i learned a lot i met a lot of amazing people i went to some wild places i just really immersed myself in that story loved your astrophotography journey do you plan on continuing the hobby yes i plan to we shall see where i go in it i'm sort of taking a break because it takes a bit of a toll on like when we're out i sort of like obsessed with it and is sort of like dude can you like just be here speak of the devil oh can't buy something like this and just like not keep up with okay i mean i didn't make a video about it really just our entire studio anyway so this gives you an idea of where we're at with astrophotography how do you script your videos uh do you include direction on motion graphics yes in fact i share all the scripts to my videos on patreon so if you go to patreon.com johnny harris there is one tier where i share all of my scripts and you can see exactly how i script my videos the short answer is yes i script every word every bit of visual direction i have scripted on paper before i even delve in okay so those are my questions uh answered today thank you audible for sponsoring this video audible i mean speaking of reading books and doing journalism audible is the place where i listen to so many books i just love audible audible is basically just a giant repository of audiobooks that you can purchase and listen to i'm listening to this audiobook called why we're polarized by ezra klein who's the founder of box it's about polarization in american politics and it is so timely and important right now if you're following american politics what i love about audible is that it's a subscription so you pay a monthly price it's like less than 15 bucks a month and you get any audio book in their huge repository for that same price one a month you

    "title": "How the U.S. Snagged All These Islands",
    "video_id": "W9KFkBvJcR4",
    "captions": "- There are a bunch of islands\nthat the United States owns at the very edge of this\nmap, deep into the Pacific like out here. And they all say like a\nlittle U.S. next to them. They're teeny tiny\nisland where no one lives and they're just in the\nmiddle of the Pacific so far away from the actual United States. Why do we own all these weird islands? What happened? Well, it has to do with\nfarming and bird poop. (upbeat hiphop music) Back in the old days,\nfarming looked like this. (cows mooing) Basically just small groups of\npeople usually a few families that would grow food for their community and that was about it. But soon the world started to change and started to look a lot less like this and a lot more like this. People started moving into the city and working in factories, mass producing commodities and items that would be shipped\nall around the world. And suddenly farmers had an incentive and a duty to make more food to ship it to these non-farm workers who are now living in cities. Farms started specializing in\none crop like corn or wheat and they were able to sell their crops not only to their local markets but to markets all around the world. But there's a problem here, when you're a farmer and\nyou're producing the same crop year after year, your soil\nstarts to lose its nutrients. It doesn't have time to regenerate and it eventually becomes\ncompletely exhausted making it impossible for\nyou to produce in abundance. And if you can't make food in abundance then you can't feed\nthese ever-growing cities of people who are working in factories. And then the global economy\nstarts to break down and the whole thing stops. For a moment there in the 1800's it was looking like earth would not be able to sustain\na population over like two and a half billion people because there wasn't enough\nnutrients in the soil to keep up with the demand for food. But luckily there was a solution to this soil nutrients problem. And that solution looked like this. (upbeat music) - One oh! - Animal waste from any animal is packed with the nutrients\nthat the soil needs to rejuvenate itself to grow\nmore crops year after year. Another term for this is fertilizer. And so now we're talking about farms and industrialization and fertilizer and you're probably thinking\nthis is a boring story but these simple facts\nled the United States to expand well beyond the borders that we think\nof the United States today, to colonize far flung islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean all in search of one special\ncommodity, bird shit. (upbeat music) So it's the mid 1800's and like I said, these farmers are growing\na ton of a single crop sending it mainly to\ncities to be consumed. Now, before all of this urbanization when people would eat this food, the waste that they would produce would be captured and\nbrought back onto the field which would help rejuvenate\nthe nutrients in the field and allow them to continue to grow in this sort of sustainable cycle. But now all of that human waste was being piped into sewage systems and then sent out to\nrivers and to the ocean completely lost. One estimate said that every year $50 million\nworth of valuable fertilizer was just wasted away\nthrough the sewer system. And this is where the bird shit comes in. (birds chirping)\n(upbeat music) If you go down to Peru and\nlook right off the coast you're gonna see a few islands. These are a little more\nthan just some rocks in the middle of the ocean\nthat were totally uninhabited. Well, I guess they were inhabited just not by humans but by birds. These birds spend their day eating fish from the ocean around the rocks, inevitably dropping their waste, pair this with the fact that these rocks don't get a lot of rain. So instead this bird dung just sits there day after day, year after\nyear baking in the sun and eventually it becomes like rock hard. You can imagine that\nafter thousands of years of this process you start to\nget some pretty thick layers of bird shit. These deposits would get up to 60 meters. That's like the size\nof this random building in Argentina that I found on the internet. The building's not\nimportant, the height is. This calcified bird poop is called guano and it contains exactly what the farmers in the\nUnited States needed to continue with the demand\nfor more and more food in the cities. Because again, bird and\nanimal waste is full of chemical properties like nitrogen that are vital for regenerating soil, meaning they're good fertilizer. Once this guano was discovered, there was a race for\neveryone around the world to get their hands on it. Soon in the United States, guano became this like\nmythical magical substance. There's all these tall tales that pop up where like this dad\nleaves his kid in the shed where the guano is contained and he opens the shed an hour later and the kid is now a full\ngrown man with facial hair or the farmer who sprinkles\nguano on his cucumbers and the vines of the cucumbers pop up and start to like attack the man. I mean, it's just crazy. It's obviously not fact-based or true but it gave a sense that\nthere was this craze that guano was going to be the savior of all of the farmers\nissues in the United States. So inevitably an economy and\na trade around guano emerged. And as always at this time,\nthe British got there first. So there was a British firm that had a monopoly\nover all the guano trade from these islands in Peru, which was sort of the best known place for guano at the time. So with this one British firm controlling the whole guano trade and demand surging, the prices skyrocketed making it way more expensive\nfor American farmers to get their hands on this amazing stuff. So who steps in to solve this issue? The president of the United States. In his first state of the union address, President Fillmore gets\nup and talks about guano. He says that, \"Peruvian guano has become\nso desirable an article\" that he felt that \"the\nduty of the government to secure it at a good\nprice for American farmers.\" This is crazy to me. Can you imagine the president\nof the United States getting up to address the nation and making it a national priority to go to some far flung place to secure some natural resource that is really important for economic growth - On my orders, coalition forces have began\nstriking selected targets of military importance to\nundermine Saddam Hussein's ability to wage war. - Yeah, I mean it's\nnot that weird I guess. So yeah this is becoming\na geopolitical issue the president is involved,\nthey want all the guano. President Fillmore says, \"nothing\nwill be omitted on my part in the effort to secure this\nmagical life giving bird shit.\" Okay actually he didn't say that last part the quotation should\nhave ended, like up here. I just sort of paraphrased the rest. The point is President Fillmore was serious about this issue. He was gonna get his guano at any cost. So he did what you do when\nyou're a rising superpower and he promised to send in warships to these Peruvian Islands if he had to in order to secure guano at a good price, even though Peru\nrightfully had sovereignty over these islands and yet here's a president\nsending in warships in order to secure the resource again, kind of sounds familiar. - America is addicted to oil. - But American lawmakers in Congress had another answer to this problem which would allow Americans to\nget their own Guano Islands. The proposed law said\nthat any American citizen not a government official\nor a military personnel could go out on their\nboat anywhere in the ocean and if they stumble\nupon one of these rocks that's covered in calcified\nbird poop they could claim it not just for themselves but for the country of the United States. No treaties, no negotiations,\nno official declaration, no government involvement even just American citizens out on their boats, looking for bird poop islands. Some lawmakers at the time were understandably uneasy with this law. Now remember that the U.S. was expanding a lot at this time. Remember that video I made about Mexico and how they're sort taking\nover Texas and California and that whole area. Yeah, that's happening around this time. But the U.S. hadn't moved\nbeyond this landmass, this contiguous shape that we think of when we think of the United States. Yeah, we had moved West but we hadn't gone for far-flung colonies far into the Pacific ocean. And secondly, the lawmakers are like, since when do we let just\nlike random American citizens go out and like help us colonize islands anywhere in the world. This would set a precedent that\nthese lawmakers were worried would have way bigger consequences than just like letting\npeople go get fertilizer for their farms. The sponsor of this bill was trying to get it through Congress, came out and said, \"listen\nguys, you're overreacting. This isn't like legit imperialism. We're not like going out and like taking over whole countries like the British or the French were doing carving up continents, no, no no. We're just going to these\nrocks to get some fertilizer for our farms it's harmless.\" And this was apparently\nenough to convince the critics and this law passes. The Guano Islands Act of 1856 where literally any American can go help expand the United States by claiming Guano Islands\nand mining this stuff and bringing it back to the United States. And so now a giant blitz of guano exploration begins\nby American citizens. (upbeat music) Sort of like the gold rush, but you know, for bird poop. Soon this claim start rolling\nin to the U.S. government random guy X from Nebraska, sailed to a random island in the Pacific planted an American flag and now it belongs to the\nUnited States of America. All in all by the end there\nwere 94 separate islands mainly in the Pacific and the Caribbean. The guano was chipped away,\nharvested, put on ships, brought back to the United States and farmers thrived. But you know who didn't thrive? The people who had to mine this stuff. I mean, you can imagine being the person who has\nto go onto these islands where you have thousands\nand thousands of years worth of layers of bird droppings to drill and cut that away and to bring it onto a ship to be shipped back to United States it's just like excruciating\nto think about. This was a pretty horrendous job. And it came with all sorts of side effects like lung issues or running out of food because you're not on an\nisland that grows food you're on a literal like rock and so the food would\ngo bad in these ships and the people would be\nlike stranded at sea. Unsurprisingly these guano\nbarons would trick people into coming with them\non these expeditions. In the case of the Pacific they would often target Hawaiians\nto recruit for these jobs. And in the case of the Caribbean they would often target Black Americans recently freed from slavery to come work on these guano ships. As some members of Congress\nat the time worried, the Guano Act had ramifications well beyond guano and fertilizer. In fact, guano became totally\nobsolete a few years later in the early 1900's when\na German chemist invented perhaps the most important\ninvention of all time, which was synthetic fertilizer a way to actually make fertilizer without having to get it\nfrom like animal waste. This allowed the population\nto grow to what it is today and really changed the\nhistory of humanity. But what it did is it made guano obsolete. And yet this law that allows Americans to take over random islands and the islands themselves\nremained on the books. But eventually with time, these claims for random rocks\nin the Pacific and Caribbean sort of just withered away and\nwe either withdrew the claims or people forgot about them and they were eventually\nclaimed by local countries like Kiribati or Tonga and places like Haiti in the Caribbean. But a few of these Guano Islands that we originally claimed remain today. We still own them, they're\nstill a part of our borders in both the Pacific and the Caribbean but the U.S. government isn't\ninterested in using them for guano anymore obviously, these mostly uninhabited\nrocks in the ocean are mainly used by the U.S. military for landing strips and sea ports. They also serve to help the\nU.S. with their ocean borders because international law says that if you have a piece of island, you get a big swath of ocean around it for your exclusive economic zone. Meaning the country who owns this island has exclusive economic rights in all of this ocean around their islands. So this greatly enhances\nthe U.S.'s ability to have sovereignty and control over certain parts of the ocean in the Pacific and Caribbean. But perhaps the most important\nresult from this guano fest was a psychological one. Like we talked about before, the U.S. was expanding\nbut it hadn't expanded beyond this contiguous\nland mass in North America that it was taking over\nrapidly in the 1800's. But soon after this laws passed, suddenly the U.S. had\npossessions in far away oceans. And what happens after\nthis is a domino effect. Suddenly if we can take\nover islands in the Pacific, why can't we annex Hawaii? Or occupy Cuba? Or Puerto Rico? Or take over an entire\ncountry of the Philippines from Spain? This law that allowed Americans to claim islands all over the world was the first step towards\nreal big boy empire behavior. And it all started with\nthe hunt for bird shit.

    "title": "Junk Mail, Explained",
    "video_id": "yyWjHVmZWvg",
    "captions": "when i get home from work tonight a thick pile of mail will be waiting for me i wasn't look this just arrived in my mailbox i don't know what's in here i i maybe there could be a letter from my grandma there could be a an important tax document maybe my driver's license renewal came through and it's in here i have no idea unless i sift through every bit of this paper to find it and that makes me mad it really makes me mad and that's why that's why i'm here same thing applies to my phone i get 10 calls a day from robots someone has access to me to my eyes my attention and i never gave them permission to have that access hello hello most of the time they just hang up too much of my life is spent sifting through information that i don't want to look at and that's a frustrating fact you know you could do a buy one get one free of dial soap this week it's pretty cool i'm tired i am tired of corporations having access to my personal attention which is already fleeting and fractured and split between a million things it's like i don't want these guys adding more to that so i am going on a quest to rid my life of junk mail in all forms yeah i'd like to cancel my mail certainly how long would you like us to hold it i went out permanently i'll handle this violet it is a journey that has taken me down some really weird paths all over the internet talking to robocall people learning about this crazy shadowy industry of people who sell and buy your information but before i can really rid my life of junk mail i have to understand where this all came from how does this industry work and how does all of this stuff end up in my life and that's what this video is about buckle up the avalanche of junk mail is more than just an annoyance i get so much junk mail it's unbelievable they have a list of every mailing address in the united states everybody works in a post office as an alien okay let me just start off by saying i'm not angry at all advertising i'm fine with most advertising in fact my job relies on advertising you probably watched a pre-roll ad before watching this video to help pay my bills okay in fact advertising has allowed a lot of really wonderful things on the internet you can read the news for free because of advertising all of your social media activity is sponsored by the ads that pass by you and i'm fine with that there are so many different ways companies try to get your attention so that you will buy their product and most of these i'm totally fine with but i draw a really important line here on this side i will call the public space advertising all of the things that come into your purview when you are sort of on someone else's space you're either driving down the road or you're scrolling on a free website or you're reading the news for free or you're scrolling your social feed or you're watching a free video on youtube this is sort of a consensual exchange where you're saying i'm going to use this service and in exchange i'm willing to be served ads okay that's like seems like really fair if you don't like it you don't have to use the service but there's a red line here and on this side of the red line are three sacred spaces my mailbox my phone and my email inbox my phone is where like my mom calls me or where i have conversations with my sister or my close friends it's direct access to like my pocket it is a very personal space my mailbox is again a personal space it's at my physical home where i live not everyone should have access to that thing that is attached to my house without my consent and then of course my email my email is where i do my job it's where i communicate with the people who are closest to me i don't want just anyone to be able to appear at will in my inbox so those are the three spaces that i consider sacred all other advertising and marketing i'm totally down with i have no issues with but unfortunately these three spaces are the holy grail for advertisers you probably know that it's really a numbers game it's all about sending out just as many mail pieces as you can to almost sort of force people to notice the mail piece what this form of advertising is called the stuff i have problems with it's called direct advertising this is the type of marketing that aims to get right in front of a human being in their most personal spaces so today you have these massive companies that you've never heard about that spend day and night scraping every piece of information from the entire world that they can get that has to do with you and your behavior your interests where you live how you consume things where you shop what your income level is and they go to really great lengths to do this sometimes they buy it from companies who you've done some sort of transaction with or sometimes they'll go to public records like real estate records to see when was the last time you bought a house driver's license records voting registration even the census can be used to profile certain neighborhoods and what they do is they take a bunch of these profiles and they put it onto a giant list and then they can sell this list so if i'm geico and i want to run a marketing campaign i'm going to buy a big list from one of these data brokers i can say with a pretty firm certainty that every person watching this video has an extensive profile on one of these lists that is owned by these big data brokerages that you've never heard of and this information is being bought and sold every day to large companies it's a very lucrative industry but wait i thought there's been all this stuff in the news about how like we're tightening up privacy and like the mismanagement of data and like tech companies are being cracked down on and isn't this all tightening up and our data is actually more protected than ever yes but but actually no oh i'm really behind the eight ball mac the mail doesn't stop bud you smoking now let's use an example that has to do with an app i use a lot doordash doordash is a meal delivery app when you sign up you give them your address and your telephone number and all the information they need to know to deliver you food i'm fine with that but as you get ready to actually sign up of course you see this familiar box of terms of use and privacy statement no one reads that i don't read that until i decided to read it and see what's going on what's doordash doing with all this information you'll see that doordash can use your data to serve you ads again i'm fine with that it's like go ahead track my behavior and cater ads to me i'm totally okay with that but what you don't realize when you're using doordash is that all of this data of your behavior and everything that's linked to you is also being tracked by a bunch of other third-party apps that doordash has baked into their app but here's the thing doordash promises in its privacy statement that they will never take my data and all this information and sell it to the big bad data brokers but wait go down a little further and you see that they wash their hands of responsibility of what these third-party apps do with your data and they suggest that you go read the privacy statement of those third parties those nine different companies that are taking my data all have privacy statements and they want me to go read each one of them and oh by the way i have no way of knowing who those companies are or what data they're collecting total nightmare those companies could easily be taking all of this data they have free rein on and selling it to the highest bidder and it would still be within the terms of use and the privacy statement of doordash let's just pause here for a second and let me remind you that again i don't necessarily have a problem with people knowing that i like sushi if it just means i'm gonna get more tailored ads when i'm like scrolling through facebook that's fine it doesn't necessarily violate my redline the big problem here and where it starts to get into my red line is that all of this data eventually will make it to a data broker who will add it to my big profile suddenly they know i like sushi and before you know it more of this is arriving on my doorstep that's where it crosses my red line and that's why i'm frustrated that they're not actually making anyone stand accountable for what they do with my data what i'm about to talk about is where it starts to get egregious and actually makes my blood boil a little bit and that has to do with the united states postal service the postal service is prohibited from selling or renting mailing lists they have their own statute on this besides the privacy act now i don't know how this works in other countries and honestly i would love to know but you know the swiss uh postal service will actually ask you do you want this junk mail delivered and if you don't they'll keep it for you and they'll recycle it but i'm just gonna explain how it works here and hope that this isn't the case everywhere else the postal service promises me on their website that they would never sell my personal information they're a freaking government agency like they're not they shouldn't be selling where i live thank you postal service that is the respectful thing to do in fact there's actually a law in the united states that says the postal service can't exploit my personal information by selling it to these data brokers so we should be good right government agency there's a law my taxpayer money pays for them we're good right no the postal service has found a sneaky way around this law it's just it's like so sleazy it's just i don't know if i can talk about it without like being angry here in the united states it's estimated that like a fifth of the population moves houses every year it's an estimate but it's a lot of people millions and millions tens of millions of people move change addresses when they do that they want their mail to not go to the old address where they used to live they want it to be forwarded to their new address you can go onto the postal service website and you can create a request that says when mail comes to my old house forward it to my new house it's really nice it's a great service and i'm very excited in fact i had to go through this recently because we're moving so i forwarded all my mail filled it out was ready to go thank you postal service okay so here's the sleazy part the postal service takes that information that i gave them when i told them hey i'm moving to this new address and they create a giant database of every single person who has moved in the u.s in the past four years and then they sell it to the freaking data brokers like this they just like full-on license this list to the data brokers and you're like wait isn't that against the law aren't they aren't they like selling my personal information well as one guy who we interviewed for this video stated if you say to them well you're selling lists they say no no no no we're not doing that we're just correcting lists you look at this more catalogs we are just helping these data brokers update their giant list of every address in the entire country we're just helping them update it to notify them of exactly who you are and where you moved to these data brokers license this list for like the tune of 200 000 to get access to this list and it's totally worth it i thought i was going to be sort of escaping the junk mail thing when we moved no because i filled out this forwarding address thing all of the data brokers now know exactly where i'm moving to freaking post office i thought we were friends i thought i funded you with my taxpayer money for the past two years i have been thinking about what it would take to completely rid my life of all of this communication not a single piece of junk mail arrives to my mailbox my inbox is completely free of everything besides what i actually want to see and my phone is a space where i get phone calls that i actually want to answer it's been an exhausting journey and if enough people comment about this and like want to hear about what that is i will gladly make the video i believe that our attention is valuable that what we decide to pay attention we use that word pay because it's like we are giving a finite resource to something what we decide to pay attention to matters and we live in a world that increasingly values that attention and creates products that are optimized to lock it in and to steal that attention without consent that's disturbing to me and so when i look at this it's not really about this it's about the principle of my finite attention being taken up by someone i didn't give permission to it's a broader effort i'm making in my life and one that i feel like is very necessary to choose the things that i pay attention to as opposed to letting those things choose me i hope this video was helpful and enlightening in some way and um i am really interested in hearing your your feedback today's video is sponsored by storyblocks who you've heard me talk about before i'm a giant fan of storyblocks i've been using storybox for many years well before they ever came to me to sponsor a video and that's because they are really the best stock footage company out there that you can pay so little for and get so much from they have a giant library of stock footage of all kind some of which i used for this video every video i make i find myself on storyblocks looking for footage to help beef up the visuals because i can't go everywhere and film everything myself and yet for like a monthly cost of a subscription you have unlimited access to all of this stuff and it's not just stock footage it's sound effects it's after effects templates it's a bunch of tools that as a creator are incredibly useful to have at my desk when i'm trying to make stuff there's a link in my description when you click that link it helps support this channel but it's where you can go to sign up for storyblocks if you're a creator this is a no-brainer to have access to all of this extra visual material to help beef up your videos so click the link in the description thank you storyblocks for supporting this video and supporting this channel i really appreciate that and thank you all for watching i'm gonna keep going on my quest to get rid of junk mail and it's hard and exhausting but it's also something i'm fairly dedicated to as you've seen in this video so have a good day that's great"

    "video_id": "zKDe094o-Q8",
    "captions": "[Music] this is the 36-inch reflector telescope it's used to study the stars okay wait i have a question that is on my mind and i can't stop thinking about it which is is it possible to take a picture of another galaxy like can someone do that who's not nasa like from your backyard can you point your camera at the sky and actually capture another galaxy that would be crazy this was a moment for me i've only had a few moments like this in my life where i ask what feels like a simple innocent question but it's actually not a simple question it's a question that ends up being like a spark lit into a dry field of brush this question sat with me for a few weeks and then one day i finally broke down and just googled it the main tool the answer is yes standing in your backyard even if you live next to a light polluted city you can photograph a galaxy like a different galaxy outside of our own i promised myself that i would do whatever it took to photograph another galaxy let's make one thing clear up front which is that i am not an astronomer before this i'd never looked through a telescope i couldn't name any stars or point out any constellations so what you're about to see is a long frustrating journey of me trying to learn something that is unbelievably technical and precise it's a story of complicated gear that seems impossible to learn complicated software it's the story of a laptop that arrived at my door one day and it's the story of hitting rock bottom and wanting to give up i'm going to bed i'm going to bed i'm going to bed so this is the story of my quest to photograph a galaxy [Music] after a bunch of research i set my sights on a galaxy called messier 101 or m101 and even though this isn't the brightest galaxy in the sky it seemed like a good choice because it's always above the horizon and it's one that i could try to photograph from the back patio of my studio this galaxy is 21 million light years away meaning the light we're seeing now has been traveling for 21 million years and the galaxy is somewhere around the handle of the big dipper you can't actually see it with your eye but presumably it's there this is the little patch of sky that i would begin looking at night after night hoping that behind the light pollution and all of this darkness that there was light that had been traveling for millions of years that i could connect with and capture on my camera but let's not get ahead of ourselves there was still a lot of work to do [Music] i have a feeling i'm getting in way over my head now i've taught myself a lot of technical skills all my animation and filmmaking skills i learned just by watching tutorials on the internet there's one thing i've learned about this self-teaching process and it looks like this if you want to learn something new like a language a piece of software a technical skill you inevitably have your eye on the prize what you want to do with that skill you see your goal and you start walking towards it but you'll quickly realize that this journey is not as straightforward as you thought you start to descend you get deeper and deeper into new unfamiliar information lots of weird new concepts that seemingly have nothing to do with your end goal you're soon so deep in this that you feel like you're not getting anywhere you feel further from your goal than you were when you started like it's totally out of sight but the secret here that you learn after you do this process a few times is that eventually you hit rock bottom of this mind-numbing chaotic intake of information and after you hit rock bottom you start going up you're moving towards your goal again concepts that used to just feel like mind-numbing chaos start to make sense and you realize that you're moving towards your goal and eventually you emerge from this abyss and you reach your goal but it was only through that descent and that rise that you were able to do this this is the process for learning difficult things from calculus to a new language the cruelest part about this whole abyss of learning is that the whole thing is shrouded in fog meaning when you are descending down into this you don't know where the bottom is you don't know if the bottom is here or if it's all the way down here this is a scary uncertain frustrating reality and it's why most people quit when they're trying to learn a new skill like this the only thing you can do is just keep going [Music] alexa make the office lights red there we go [Music] i watched a few tutorials on how to set this stuff up and it's feeling incredibly complicated so after that first night of setting up the camera and like dramatically struggling to like get it all working and all that stuff i thought i was like deep in this learning abyss and i have no idea what i'm doing i thought i was like here i had absorbed all this info i'd done all the research on what gear i needed to buy and i set it all up i read the instruction manual i was like man i am so deep in this astrophotography thing big lens i feel like it's speaking my language just like a few days away from photographing a galaxy no no no no no no i was not even close i was actually here the fog was very thick and i had no idea and so over the next couple of weeks i began to realize what was actually happening here before you can even take pictures of the night sky the first thing you have to do is take this mount and you have to align it to the night sky you point it at different stars you align it to the north star you do all this stuff to basically tell the mount where it is in the world and where the night sky is and then it starts to track the night sky as the earth spins it's really cool but it's kind of complicated to get it right i'm deep in this dark sky way out at my cabin everything should be perfect and i can't even align my telescope and it's super important because if your telescope isn't aligned it's not going to be able to point in the right patch of sky to photograph a galaxy well now i've got a giant full moon to keep me company but the reality is i just spent 30 minutes trying to locate the northern star with my polar alignment scope thing so i've got much bigger problems than a full moon i had predicted that it would take me one or maybe two days to get this alignment right instead after about a month i finally started to have success aligning my telescope mount moment of truth i think the telescope is now totally lined and if it points at the moon that means i did it right here we go enter it's going oh man oh man it's pointing at them it's pointing at the moon i finally got my telescope mount aligned to the night sky and i thought okay the hard part's over i've done it i've aligned the telescope now i just need to take my picture and it turns out i was totally right in fact i was already on my way up from the abyss i just had to press a couple of buttons and suddenly i was getting amazing shots of far away galaxies every night no that is definitely not what happened in fact the reality was that i had barely inched down to where i was before there was still a lot more to go luckily i had stumbled upon an instagram account with some amazing shots of the night sky i dm'd andrew who runs the account and asked for some help andrew kept talking about stacking stacking your images stick the images i need to take multiple pictures of the same patch of sky so i can layer them together you're not just taking one picture of a galaxy you're taking hundreds of pictures of that same patch of sky and you integrate them together you stack them together which will get rid of a lot of the weird noise and stuff and it will allow you to see the galaxy stacking so i did what andrew and the internet tutorials told me to do i took hundreds of shots while my telescope mount would track this little patch of sky where i hoped the galaxy was but then came the slow part spending hours loading these huge image files onto my computer and waiting what seemed like forever for the computer to process and calibrate and stack all of these images into one final image this took forever and often the final result wasn't very encouraging this is very disappointing it's one in the morning and i'm looking at basically a black frame with a few little dots that are the stars and the software gave me this nothing it looks like nothing it looks like a bunch of white dots on a black background i'm really excited about this new hobby of mine i don't know man i'm going to bed i'm going to bed i'm going to bed here is the moment that i was ready to throw in the towel to give up i had invested a lot of time and money into this goal and i felt like i was nowhere closer to photographing and seeing m101 than when i started after hours of these brain numbing tutorials and fiddling with these tools and trying night after night all i had to show for it was this i started to question if the telescope was even pointing in the right bit of sky to capture m101 i was ready to give up it's months later and i've been trying a million things i'm budding up against a really really complicated reality which is i'm trying to photograph a galaxy outside of my own millions of light years away from me of course that's going to be hard the idea of photographing a galaxy feels so distant for me like it feels so [Music] far away i couldn't see it then but i see now that that night i was at rock bottom it was at the bottom of this abyss my quest to photograph a galaxy had turned into a mess of sleepless nights fiddling with complicated equipment and hours waiting for my computer to process hundreds of images it seemed like i really hadn't learned anything but in fact i had i had made it through the most excruciating part the descent into chaotic novel abstract information and now it was time to go up i really wanted a rocky style montage and i didn't get that in real life but the best i can do is give you that rocky montage so here it goes a few things happen next first i committed to devouring tutorials daily there's a pretty active niche community of astrophotographers on the internet many of whom take it upon themselves to make extensive tutorials part one part two and part three i had watched a lot of these tutorials before but they didn't actually make sense the first time around but now months later i could watch them and they actually started to sink in luckily it was at this time that i got reached out to by nvidia who makes like graphics cards and hardware for computers they wanted to send me an hp laptop that was packed with a really nice graphics card this would make my workflow a lot easier because now i would have a computer with a graphics card that actually talked to my software and was optimized for really fast editing and fast processing especially in photoshop and lightroom this would make the whole process a lot quicker and what this meant as well is that i could use this laptop which was a pc to control a dedicated astro camera so i could do it all for my computer this new machine empowered me and completely changed the game i'm on my way up this is amazing i am getting there [Music] but it didn't photograph the galaxy for me i still had a lot of work to do over the next couple of months this was my life i started sleeping on the patio so that i could image throughout the night and then one night i was at my computer fishing around in this sea of grainy pixels and i saw something holy crap okay this is my really shitty image from last night but if you zoom in you actually start to see a literal galaxy that is insane yeah this is this is hundreds of images together [Music] it's paying off this looked like my galaxy like m101 i immediately texted my astrophotography sensei andrew but as i said in the text there's still a lot of work to do and then one day it happened i made it to the top i was on the other side of this abyss i stacked 400 images from a night of shooting i brought it into my new computer i stacked it up integrated it processed it did all of these things that i had now done hundreds of times and in that moment i answered my question from months earlier from your backyard can you point your camera at the sky and actually capture another galaxy yes me from the past you can photograph another galaxy standing on the back patio of your studio if you just point your telescope at the right patch of sky for the right amount of time you will be able to capture light that has been traveling for 21 million years to meet you and you can record that as an image and that image looks like this this is m101 or the pinwheel galaxy 21 million light years from earth it's one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen mainly because i worked so hard to capture this bit of light that was really hard very discouraging at times but throughout all of it there were really special moments i got to spend countless nights outside looking up contemplating the distances in space something my brain can't even begin to digest and all of this in order to capture a little bit of light from 21 million years ago that has been traveling towards earth all that time and i got to record that little teaspoon of light this process gave me a new perspective one i won't easily forget it taught me that if you want to learn something new all that stands between you and that goal is a descent and a rise through this abyss another takeaway from this process was the importance of having good tools for your goal as i told you in this story this moment actually happened where i was struggling i was spending so much time on these image stacks and i then got reached out to by nvidia and hp who wanted to send me this laptop that promised way better performance and indeed it delivered suddenly my image stacking workflow which would take me like an hour suddenly was like a 15 minute thing more importantly when i would open up these images that are like 400 megabyte tiff files you know really really heavy i'd open them up in photoshop no more lagging i was able to like zoom in and actually zoom around this image and edit it and there was no like flashy lagging issues that i was getting with my old laptop the display was like butter smooth i could zoom in i could change levels and curves and all this stuff and like it would just update on the display it was just a pleasure to work on and made it way less discouraging for me to practice my post-processing this is all made possible because nvidia the graphics card maker has found a way to get the graphics card to talk to the software in a way that is optimized for performance so now when i'm rendering stuff in premiere it's way faster like 30 minute renders suddenly turn into like 12-minute renders if i'm trying to render proxies for you know a time lapse which is like hundreds and hundreds of images that's now going at double or triple the speed i'm incredibly grateful for that because it helped kick-start my second wind to help me actually get serious about completing this goal again this wasn't some like fabricated planned moment this actually happened in the course of my trying to complete this goal so there's a link in my description if you want to check out this laptop or learn more about nvidia and their studio drivers and how that works to make your workflow quicker go check out that link and thank you to nvidia and hp for supporting this video and supporting my goal to photographic galaxy for sending me this laptop and for supporting this channel last thing i'll say is if anyone wants a high-res version of this galaxy image that i shot i'm going to be giving it out to anyone who is a patron on patreon so go check out my patreon if you want a high-res version or anything else that's on patreon thank you all for watching [Music]"

    "title": "How the U.S. Stole Mexico",
    "video_id": "3OMmxKiG4LE",
    "captions": "- Back when the British\nempire was colonizing all of this land, they drew a line. The line went right along\nthis little mountain range and it was meant as a boundary. Back in London, there were saying that no English settler was allowed to settle West of this line. The British empire did this\nbecause they were worried that if settlers started\nto expand into the West they would bring the British Empire into a war with native populations. They also didn't wanna\nunnecessarily piss off France who also had land in the West. So they told their settlers to settle, but not pass this line. And then the settlers\ncompletely ignored it. (upbeat music) These settlers would\neventually declare independence from Britain and start their own country. And from there the flood gates were open for westward expansion. - [Announcer] A frontier\npeople had remade a continent. Virtually all productive land\nhad been put to the plough. A free and independent\nway of life prevail. (upbeat music) - This westward blitz\nwas made possible through the mass slaughter of people\nwho were living on this land, which this little time lapse ignores. How that all went down will be\nthe subject of another video. But right now I want to\ntalk about what happened when the U.S. got here. (upbeat music) It's the mid 1800s and\nthe U.S has 27 States and a bunch of territories in the West, but the country doesn't stretch from sea to shining sea quite yet. At this point, they start to bump in to the recently independent\ncountry of Mexico. (upbeat music) The Northern part of Mexico\nwas called Tejas or Texas, and it was populated\nmainly with native groups who had nothing to do\nwith the U.S. or Mexico. They had just been living\nthere for centuries. So Mexico is looking at this fairly new sparsely populated\npart of their country and thinking what you know, what do we do with all this land? They want to incentivize people to go with and settle in this land so it would potentially be\nmore economically productive for the country of Mexico. So they made a plan. They started to rent huge swaths of land to American settlers so\nthat they would come in and settle the land. And then return, these American settlers would recruit more settlers\nto come in and settle the land again, all with the hope that it would benefit Mexico's\neconomy eventually. It did exactly the opposite. American settlers fled into Texas onto this newly rented land, just as the Mexican government hoped for, but with them they brought slaves, which was totally illegal\nin Mexico at the time. They also brought with them an attitude of independence and frontier fever. This American obsession with\nmoving West to settle new land. - [Narrator] The westward movement, was like a great title wave. The odd corners were rapidly engulfed. - Mexico soon realized that\nthis plan completely backfired and that the Americans that\nhad rented land from them were now not interested in having Mexico as their government. So Mexico sends in the\nmilitary to remind the settlers that they're still in Mexico and that they're technically\nrenting this land from Mexico. Well, this eventually escalated and they started to fight all out battles. And the American settlers lost. The big battle here was called\nthe Battle of the Alamo. This guy, David Crockett, who was like the symbol of Westward\nexpansion, died in this battle. And this loss spurred even more settlers to come to Texas and joined\nthe next fight against Mexico, which the American settlers won. And with that, they declared a new nation independent of Mexico,\nthe Republic of Texas. And now the map looks like this. A newly declared country\nof American settlers in between Mexico and the United States. But not everyone actually agreed that the map looked like this. While Mexico conceded\nthat they lost the war. They disputed this map saying that the border of the\nnew Republic of Texas was actually here. And that all of this was still Mexico. So now you have a big land\ndispute between Mexico and the Republic of Texas. Well soon it's 1845 and Texas becomes the 28th\nstate of the United States. And yet this land is still disputed, but now it's a land dispute between the United States\nof America and Mexico. Let's keep in mind that\ndespite all of this map drawing there are still loads of\nnative peoples who've lived on this land for years and\nare now being suffocated by all these nations\ntrying to take their land. Again, that's another episode and it's an important episode\nand I want to do it justice. But for now what happens next in the Mexico story gets kind of nuts. And the reason it gets\nkind of nuts is mainly because of this guy,\npresident James K. Polk. James Polk wins the presidency and comes into office with\na list of four big things he wants to do. It's his big wishlist. At the top of this wishlist\nis Polk desire to capture this very specific part of Mexico, which is called California. Remember that at the time, the\nU.S. didn't actually stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The U.S. had colonized\nportions of Oregon territory, but it was kind of confusing because there were kind of\ncompeting with the French and the British, and they\ndidn't actually own it yet. But you'll notice that Oregon\nwas also on Polk's shortlist, but first California. He first tried to buy\nCalifornia from Mexico for $25 million. Mexico flat out said no. So Polk decides to pull\nan incredibly dirty move. Remember this big old\nswath of disputed territory that the U S inherited when they admitted Texas into the union, James Polk was pissed off that\nMexico didn't take his offer to buy California. So he sends a small group of troops into this disputed territory and has the March right up to here, right across from the river that separates what\neveryone agrees is Mexico. But according to Mexico,\nthey've already been in Mexico as soon as they crossed\ninto this dispute territory, which Mexico believes is theirs. So the Mexican army is sent to respond to what looks like an oncoming attack from the United States. This is exactly what Polk wanted. A group of 1,600 Mexican soldiers attack this small group of 80\nAmericans killing 11 of them and capturing the rest. They easily one, since\nthey were outnumbered by like a magnitude of like 20. But this is exactly what Polk needed to get his wishlist going. After this battle, Polk\ngoes to Congress and reports that the Mexicans have\nquote, invaded our territory and shed American blood\nupon American soil. Even though this wasn't\nnecessarily American soil; it was disputed territory that most people thought\nwas rightfully Mexico. But it didn't matter. The death of Americans was\nenough to rally Congress around declaring war with Mexico. The U.S. easily won this war\nand they did it pretty quickly. Remember that the taking\nover of Texas was originally a bunch of settlers who band\ntogether, made a militia, fought Mexico on their own and declared the Republic of Texas. Not super great, but at least it wasn't like a government leader\nsending his soldiers in that he knows, are going to\nlose to provoke another country to kill those soldiers so that he can use democratic processes and institutions to make war all so that he can take over\nland from that country. I mean, Polk really wanted California. There were critics of this in the time. One of whom was this guy who\nsaid that letting Polk force the country into war\nwith Mexico was quote, allowing him to make war at pleasure. And Abe hit the nail on the head. This whole war was started and fought at the pleasure of this\npresident, James K. Polk. So anyway, the U S easily wins the war. They pay Mexico $15 million and Mexico gave up all of this. As a part of this loss.\nMexico also conceded all of this disputed territory making it officially a part\nof the U S state of Texas. The U.S. had grown significantly\nin just a couple of years. And Polk got his California. The U.S.could have taken more land. Some American lawmakers at the time wanted to take all of Mexico. And militarily they likely\ncould have done this, but they only took this part\nof Mexico because it was the most sparsely populated\nmainly by native Americans. One Senator at the time, who\nhappened to be pro-slavery, argued on the Senate floor\nagainst taking all of Mexico. Saying quote, we have never\ndreamt of incorporating into the Union, any,\nbut the Caucasian race, the free white race. Are we to associate with\nourselves as equal companions and fellow citizens, the Indians\nand mixed races of Mexico? In other words, let me put it plainly. The policy was let's search\nfor land where we exterminate the natives and settle white people instead of let's take land where there's already big populations that are non white people that we would have to\nbring into our country. This is a policy that\ninformed American expansion and imperialism for a very long time. And it's what guided a lot\nof what land we took over and what land we didn't take over. Okay, so through this\nunprovoked racially tinge war Polk checked off California from his list. And just the next month Oregon was organized into a territory after working out a deal with the British. Polk had exterminated anyone in his way. And now he had a coast to coast country. A few years later they bought this little\npiece of land from Mexico and this completed the Southern\nborder that we know today. One that was forged first from a rebellion of American settlers, then a war at the\npleasure of James K. Polk. And then finally that little\npurchase there at the end. The native people and\nMexicans that lived here when the U.S. took it over. And let's be clear on something\nthat is not a small number. They were predictably oppressed as white settlers fled into this region often looking for gold. Native people were driven from their land and the rights of Mexican\nproperty owners were erased in the name of a state constitution that only let white people vote. - [Narrator] This land after\na little more than a century and a half had become great nation, the United States of America. - So, the U S stole Mexico in the 1800s, partly because they opened\ntheir borders to Americans to let them in to work their land, which is just a very\nstrange, full circle irony. Especially because today you\ngo to the U.S.-Mexico border and we do everything to make it clear that this side of that wall is U.S. when just a few years\nago it was all Mexico. I wish like the Hawaii video I had some high note to\nend on here, but I don't. So, so yeah. These stories about how the\nU.S. expanded teach me so much about how the U.S. got it\nshape and how the world works and how countries grow and change. And I've really been learning\na lot by delving into these. Before you go, I want to tell you about a really important\nresource online called Skillshare who's the sponsor of this video. But more importantly\nSkillshare is a platform that I've used for many years\nto learn a lot of the skills that I used in today's\nvideo and I'm always using. Animation, video, design. All of these things I taught myself. I didn't go to school for. Skillshare was a key\npart of that education. I've taken loads of Skillshare\ncourses over the years. Well, before they came to sponsor video. And I'm just, I really\nbelieve in this model. And you can get two\nmonths of unlimited access to all Skillshare tutorials for free if you click the link in my description, which you click that link it\nhelps support this channel, but more importantly it\nengulfed your ability to start learning new skills. If you're looking for a course to try out, I want to recommend this\ncourse on animation loops. It's called creating crazy\nanimation loops in after effects. This course really lays out step by step, how you can concept and\ndesign interesting designs, but then how you can loop them in ways that create a much more powerful\nand interesting animation. So check that out. But honestly, Skillshare\nhas courses of all kinds, not just animation and video, but like cooking and entrepreneurship and like a million different topics. Thousands of courses. You can get access to all of\nthem for free for two months if you click that link. And then after that, it's like, I think less than 10 bucks a month if you do the annual subscription, which for what you're\ngetting, like, I'm sorry. It's like, it's like a full on education in like creative arts. And you're getting that\nfor 10 bucks a month. Like, it seems like a no brainer. That's just me. I love learning on the internet. So check out that link. Thank you, Skillshare\nfor sponsoring this video and supporting this channel. Thank you all for supporting\nthis channel by being here and leaving your feedback. And I will see you in the next video. See you later."

    "title": "How the US Stole Hawaii",
    "video_id": "XK2MBnw6RlY",
    "captions": "(water bubbling and gushing) - [Johnny] 40 million years ago, the ocean floor cracked open and molten lava started flowing out. It cooled as it hit the cold\nocean water and turned solid, eventually making mountains in the ocean. Those mountains got taller and taller, and soon a chain of islands was born. And then, around 2000 years ago, a group of people arrived\nto these islands in canoes. Those communities eventually\nunified into one kingdom, the kingdom of Hawaii. A sovereign nation in the\nmiddle of the Pacific Ocean. Hawaii became a language, a\nculture, a national identity. But that sovereignty, that culture, that identity was soon stolen, captured by a new, bigger\ncountry, an ocean away. (rapid ticking)\n(sinister music) - [Man] This is the\nstory of these islands. (sinister music) - [Man] For millions of\nyears, there was no land here. Only the sea. - [Man] Hawaii's half century\nold request for statehood is granted. - [Johnny] The Kingdom of Hawaii remained a fairly remote\ndisconnected country for many years, until these guys arrived. During the 1700 and 1800's, many people from Europe\nand the United States came to visit Hawaii, mainly on expeditions\nof exploring the ocean. But the ones that stayed\nwere mainly Americans who arrived to these islands wanting to talk about Jesus. For the most part, the Kingdom of Hawaii\nwelcomed these visitors. One British Explorer even gifted the Hawaiian\nKing a British flag and Hawaii eventually\nadopted the British flag into their own flag. There was general friendship\nand good relations here. The American missionaries\nwho had settled on the island eventually had kids and grandkids. And soon these missionaries\nand their descendants weren't just interested\nin talking about Jesus. They were also interested\nin building businesses, mainly focused on sugar. - [Man] By far the most\nvaluable single product Hawaii can offer in that trade is sugar. - [Johnny] With this\nincreased economic interest, these Americans who had\noriginally come to be missionaries were now much more into sugar, and they did what people\nof European descent have been doing for many centuries, looking at a culture and government that is different than theirs and saying, we think we could do this better, let us take it from here. And so during the 1800's, these Americans slowly chipped away at the Hawaiian government structure. They were still newcomers in\nthis ancient Island nation. They didn't have much power. But that changed quickly. - [Man] The Pacific\nalways comes rolling in. Mile upon mile dazzling white beachs. - [Johnny] By the end of the 1800's, these Jesus sugar Americans had amassed a huge\namount of Hawaii's wealth and those original missionaries who had come to the Island to convert people to their\nreligion years earlier now had grandkids that looked like this, a full on armed militia of\nwhite Hawaiian citizens, descendants of the missionaries, who were eager to get the\ngovernment out of the way so that they could run\nthe country themselves and help make it more favorable\nfor their sugar businesses. Now, remember, these\nguys were born in Hawaii. They considered themselves the Hawaiians. But even still, their loyalty still lie with\nthe country of their ancestors. They were effectively Americans still. By 1893, this local white militia\nand their political allies were ready for a full on\ntakeover of the government, which at the time was\nheaded by this woman, Queen Lili'uokalani. The sugar missionaries\nwere still a minority and a full on overthrow of the government would have been hard by themselves. But luckily for them, they had help. The American ambassador\nof Hawaii at the time helped coordinate the arrival of an American military ship and troops to show up on the shores\nof the Island of a Oahu into the capital city of Honolulu. Up until this point, the conflict in Hawaii\nwas technically internal, meaning it was between the\nlocals and the white missionaries who were technically locals because they were born there. But the moment the US arrived to Honolulu to provide military backup\nfor a government overthrow, it became a full line military coup sponsored by a foreign power, a Cardinal sin in international relations. But even still the government\nbacked the overthrow. The queen was forced to give up her power and they put this guy as the leader of the\nnew Republic of Hawaii. His name was Sanford Dole. His family was huge in the sugar business. - [Man] There's a new taste\nin pineapple from Dole. - [Johnny] And now he was the leader of the country of Hawaii. The locals fought this but peacefully. They protested. Nearly every adult on the islands signed a petition condemning the takeover. Back in Washington DC, a debate began as to\nwhat to do with Hawaii now that a bunch of\npro-American missionaries turned sugar warriors had grabbed power. Dole himself traveled to DC to lobby for the US to take over\nHawaii for themselves. But so did a group of local Hawaiians to oppose the American encroachment. The queen who was overthrown wrote a letter demanding to be reinstated as the legitimate leader\nof the Kingdom of Hawaii. The United States was split\non what to do until 1898 when the new president\nsurrounded himself with leaders who kind of loved war\nand American expansion. And this is what sealed\nthe fate of Hawaii. All of these displays of\nvehement peaceful protests by the Hawaiian people were trampled on by a\nsuperpower who had bigger guns and an insatiable desire for control. So one summer day in\n1898, the US showed up and the flag of the Kingdom\nHawaii was taken down and the US flag was raised. Hawaii was now officially a possession of the United States of America. With the help of these\nsugar loving missionaries, these islands had been\nplucked from their people and put in the hands of\na growing superpower. But stealing land is one thing. The real theft is what happened next. (ominous music) At this point, Hawaii was just\na US territory, not a state, but even still the US began a\ndeep, widespread destruction of Hawaiian way of life. The Hawaiian language\nwas banned in schools and government and businesses were by law required to be conducted in English. The US began developing\nland, often on sacred sites. And the history itself was censored to make it seem as if the Hawaiian people welcomed the US without a fight. Much of the real history\nbecame inaccessible because it was only documented\nin the Hawaiian language, which was beginning to die. And then in 1959, Hawaii became\nthe 50th state of the union and quickly became the\nplace we know today. (island music) Meanwhile, Dole food company, the company who was\nperhaps helped the most by this land grab, has become a massive global corporation. By 1993, Hawaii was a full\non part of the United States. That year, President Bill\nClinton came out with an apology. - A Presidential apology. At the White House yesterday, President Clinton signed\na formal letter of apology to the people of Hawaii. He was apologizing on\nbehalf of the US government for the government's\ninvolvement 100 years ago in removing the independent\nHawaiian monarchy by force. - But despite this horrendous land grab and the pillaging and\ntheft of these islands, there is a little bit of hope here. That spirit of peaceful resistance that led to petitions and\nprotests back in 1893, persisted, even after the takeover. The Hawaiian language\nwas delicately preserved through painstaking effort. And today there are full immersion Hawaiian language public schools. Hawaiian traditions have stayed alive. And last year Hawaiians showed that they were not willing to\ngive up their sacred sites. They staged a dramatic protest\nto protect a Holy mountain that was slated to be developed on. Hawaii may have been stolen and attempts made to erase its culture, but while the negative effects\nof this Imperial land grab are wide reaching, many pillars of this beautiful\nculture have survived. So I haven't really been\ntraveling much for obvious reasons and because of that I've been watching a lot more shows in the evening, which has been really fun\nto sort of watch new stuff, learn new things. One of the shows I\nwanted to watch for ages was the Michael Jordan documentary, which off limits to me 'cause\nI don't like have cable or ESPN or any of that. Last month I discovered\na way I could watch it using Express VPN, which happens to be the\nsponsor of today's video, but also something that I\ngenuinely want to tell you about because it's pretty exciting. A VPN allows you to route your connection through a different country, which there's some security benefits in keeping your data safe\nand private and all that, but in this case, it allowed me to watch the\nMichael Jordan documentary in its entirety on Netflix on demand, which was just like, I feel\nlike I had won the lottery. I even was talking about it\nand I just wasn't watching it and suddenly I was, and\nIz and I just binged it. There are a lot of offerings on Netflix that are available in other\ncountries and not your country. Suddenly I can watch\n\"Spirited Away\" on Netflix or \"Lord of the Rings\". I mean, I'd been using\nExpress VPN for years, mainly for the sort of privacy element, but in this case, I'm realizing that it's way more than\njust a privacy tool.

    "captions": "(cooking sounds medley) - Breakfast time and I'm eating chips. (chill out music) Okay so I made this video about why Americans eat dessert for breakfast. - [Narrator] Two pancakes\nwith hot syrup and butter. - And in that video, I\nsaid I would share with you the non-American breakfast\nI've started eating if enough people commented, and let's just say,\nenough people commented. (slamming sounds) (chime dinging) For the past several months, I've been on this journey of inviting different breakfast\ntraditions into my home and into my habits, and that's a hard thing to do, but I've officially done it, and I want to share it with you. So I'm gonna share with you my top three non-American breakfast traditions. I wanna see in the comments if you have suggestions on other breakfast that I could try out that I'm\nnot mentioning here, okay? So leave those in the comments, for now, let's get into my\nbreakfast enlightenment. (chill out music) First up is Japanese. (chill out music) I went to Japan for\nthe first time in 2017, I was shooting an episode of Vox Borders, and I had just taken a 14-hour flight, I was totally delirious, I got off the flight, I met up with my fixer in Tokyo and it was morning time and she was like, \"Do\nyou wanna get breakfast?\" and I was like, \"Yeah, sure.\" So we showed up to a\nplace called Yoshinoya. - [Yoshi] Yoshi! - I walk into this place, I have no idea what to order, and my fixer is like, \"Don't worry, \"I'll order you something.\" And she did, and before I knew it, out came a platter that looked like this. (chill out music) It came with rice, and miso soup, and a lightly grilled salted salmon and a raw egg. Yes, a raw egg. I kind of freaked out\nwhen I saw the raw egg, I was like, why didn't they cook the egg, isn't there salmonella in this egg? Turns out in Japan,\nthey're just a lot better about cleanliness and quality\ncontrol on their eggs, not surprisingly, and because of that, they don't worry about salmonella like we do in the United States. So it turns out, you can eat a raw egg. And I did and this meal turned out to be one of the best meals of my life. I ate it every day during that trip. And here I am, three years later, trying to reform my breakfast, and where do I turn but this meal. (chill out music) Turns out, this meal is\ncalled tamago kake gohan. Which basically means egg on rice, and it is a very simple,\ntraditional Japanese breakfast. To recreate this, I went to a wonderful\nJapanese-Korean market near my home, and I went shopping for all of the goods. First thing I did was buy a rice cooker, I didn't have a rice cooker before, and I found out that a good rice cooker makes all of the difference. Second up, good salmon. I kind of just throw some soy sauce on the salmon, throw it in\nthe oven for 12 to 14 minutes, and then wrap it up and\nput it in my refrigerator, and I eat it all week. So now my mornings with\nJapanese breakfast mean washing some rice, throwing\nit in the rice cooker, pulling it out 30 minutes later, and putting on a piece of\nsalmon, some sesame seed, sometimes an avocado,\noftentimes a lot of ginger, and all topped off with this amazing Hello Kitty branded soy sauce, that's like, kind of a morning\ntamago kake gohan sauce that I found at this market. It is delicious. It is unbelievably delicious\nto have rice in the morning, it's like salty, the salmon is salty, the ginger is amazing, I put seaweed in it sometimes, and I, like, when I'm eating that, I am just a happy happy human. I also make a big pot\nof miso soup on Sundays, which is a very easy soup, you can throw, like, six\ningredients into a pot, let it sort of simmer for a bit, and then you have miso soup\nfor the rest of the week. Oh and for the raw egg,\nI end up just taking a high-quality American raw egg and whipping it into the hot rice, and it's delicious and I've\nbeen eating it for months now and I have not gotten sick, so you can do it too. This food is so good. Next up, let's talk\nabout Israel-Palestine. (chill out music) Okay, listen. Too much of my life has already\nbeen spent in the comment section of videos, reading and responding\nto comments on videos that I make about Israel-Palestine. Today, we're not talking\nabout the decades-old conflict where one asymmetrical\npower is illegally occupying the other, ugh, jeeze,\nsee, you can't help it, you just, you can't help it. Anyway, today we're\ntalking about breakfast. I was in Jerusalem in 2016 reporting on the conflict, and I was meeting up with\nan Israeli journalist who I had met online,\nwanted to hang out with, she told me to come to a breakfast spot, so I navigated to the breakfast spot, I parked, and I looked, and I realized, it was a hummus restaurant. Hummus. For breakfast. I was little caught off-guard because in my mind,\nhummus looked like this. It was always like the extra add-on that we would bring in a picnic and in short, I didn't understand hummus. During that trip, I had hummus\nof all kinds for breakfast, in West Jerusalem, in East Jerusalem, with falafel, with toppings of different types of tahini, with mushrooms, oh man, and every hummus was different, and all of it was delicious. So fast forward three or four years and I'm in my breakfast crisis, I just genuinely do not want to wake up and consume dessert for breakfast. And I decided that hummus is something that I want to invite into my home. A little daunting, 'cause I was like, isn't hummus super complicated to make? Turns out, it's not. (chill out music) Hummus is effectively\njust chickpeas and tahini, which is ground up sesame seed. You can soak your own chickpeas, which is incredibly cheap, or you can just buy\npre-soaked, canned chickpeas, however you wanna do it. Basically what you're doing is combining a bunch of ingredients into a blender, and just blending it up, and you have hummus and you have hummus for the entire week, and it is a perfect\nplatform to add anything to, I've been adding feta or an egg or pairing it with pickles\nand beautiful bread, I even tried my hand at making\npita bread for the first time which is actually a pretty\nsimple, straightforward bread, I did it on a griddle\nand in the oven, as well, both were fantastic, I mean, this is just amazing food\nto have in the morning. It's smooth and light but\nalso creamy, for some reason, but it's not creamy like\nit leaves you, like, wanting to take a nap,\nit's just good food. And now I make a big pot of hummus at the beginning of the week, and we have it for the whole week, it stays good forever, not actually forever, doesn't\nactually stay good forever, so, like, don't eat it after,\nlike, two, three months. Anyway, hummus is amazing. (chill out music) Okay so the last breakfast\nI wanna talk about today comes from Texas, but really Mexico, I mean Texas was Mexico\nand Mexico was Texas, and then the US stole it all, and anyway I'm making a video about that, but let's just talk about breakfast. (chill out music) Last year, we were at South,\nin South West, in Austin, Iz was speaking, and I was just tagging along, and eating a million tacos. One morning, we walked\nup to this taco truck. Vera Cruz all natural. Oof. Just saying the name makes my mouth water. Listen, I've eaten a\nlot of tacos in my life. I lived in Northern Mexico for two years, I ate a lot of tacos,\nI continue to eat tacos whenever I'm in that region, and yet this morning those tacos were some of the best tacos\nI've ever had in my life. If not some of the best pieces of food I've ever consumed. The tacos at Vera Cruz\nare called migas tacos, which is whipping scrambled\neggs with corn chips, like, crushed up corn chips, and they kind of soften but\nthey retain their crunch and they just make for\nthis delicious stuffing into a taco, you can also add all pastor, which is, like, pork, and oh, just delicious. It's usually topped with cilantro, onion, and of course, topped with your choice of delicious salsa. All of this wrapped in a freshly made thin but fatty flour tortilla. Flour tortilla, the key to\na delicious breakfast taco, is the flour tortilla. I'm a big fan of corn,\nbut a flour tortilla in the morning is just amazing. This food wakes you up, it fills you up, and\nit just makes you happy to be alive when you're eating it. I know it sounds super dramatic, but I'm telling you, man, I have a very strong\naffinity to breakfast tacos. Inviting this in my home\nwas not a hard thing to do because I've been making\nMexican-inspired food for many years, ever\nsince I lived in Mexico, and what I love about\nit is it's simple food. It is eggs, and chips, and tortilla, and you could throw cheese on there, and an avocado. (chill out music) Okay, so those are my three\nnew staples in my life, Japanese, hummus, and breakfast tacos. I promised I'd tell you\nwhich of these is my favorite and I have to say that\nJapanese takes the cake. Cake. There's something about\nhaving rice in the morning, it's just, it fills you up,\nit stays with you for hours and I love breakfast. Never thought I'd say it but I\nlove freakin' love breakfast. So remember, if you haven't already, go in the comments and tell me if you have a non-American breakfast idea that I can start trying out in my life, give as much detail or a link as possible, I would love to see what other\npeople eat for breakfast, all of these ideas that I got came from just casual interactions with people who live in other countries who do have different breakfast paradigms and I hope that reading\nthrough the comments I can get some more ideas.

    "title": "Why Americans Eat Dessert for Breakfast",
    "video_id": "kNovwPIWr3Q",
    "captions": "(bubbles popping) (screen whooshing) - I (beeping) hate American breakfast. - [Child] Right away, I\nneed a good breakfast. - [Man] Right away, a big bite of toast. - [Man] For kids, we like a\nsquare meal for breakfast. - [Man] A wonderful new\nfruit in the box cereal (bell ringing) (upbeat music) - I mean, how did we get here? How did this\n(fluid moving) become breakfast in my country? And what is breakfast even all about? Some people say it's the most\nimportant meal of the day, and others say that\nit's totally worthless, and you don't even need to eat breakfast if you don't want to. - [Man] Two pancakes with\nhot syrup and butter. - I bet a lot of you\nwatching don't eat breakfast in the morning, and you knew who else doesn't\neat breakfast in the morning? This guy. - [Interviewer] what do\nyou eat for breakfast? - Nothing. - I grew up thinking that\nbreakfast had to be a certain way, (funky music) but then in my twenties, I started traveling and\nI learned that in fact, this version of breakfast\nis a very narrow, very American version of breakfast. Once I discovered\n(pan sizzling) non-American breakfast,\n(liquid pouring) I feel like my eyes were opened to a completely different approach to the first meal of the day. I want to show you some\nof those breakfasts, but first, let's talk about breakfast and how American breakfast got this way. - [Man] for about 22 cents, You get as much nutrition as\nthis bacon and egg breakfast when there's no time for\nyour regular breakfast. - Okay, before I jump\ninto all of my opinions about breakfast, let's talk about science\nfor a minute, like facts. (mouse clicking) does breakfast matter? Is it actually the most\nimportant meal of the day like I was told my whole life? - [Man] You can't be your best if you don't eat a good breakfast. - Turns out there's data\non this, lots of studies, but you don't need to read them all. In fact, don't read them all. Let me give you the 20-second version. It turns out the methods\nin a lot of these studies are really crummy. They weren't randomized controlled trials, like the gold standard for good science, and in a lot of cases, they didn't really study anything useful. They kind of hyper focus on breakfast as it pertains to weight. And in most of these studies, they don't even focus on what the person is eating for breakfast, they only focus on whether they\ndo or do not eat breakfast, regardless of what\nthey're actually eating. And to add to all of this, a lot of these studies are funded by corporations who have a vested interest in making breakfast seem\nnecessary and healthy. So yeah, there's a lot of science on this, but the science does not come\nto any useful conclusions, and is often times just poorly conducted. (screen snapping)\nWhat this means is that there's no real evidence that breakfast is the most\nimportant meal of the day, and there's nothing special\nor magic about breakfast. That's more of a marketing\nmyth than anything else. - [Man] Had any really good days lately? Like when the sun shines brighter, and people seem friendlier, and work goes faster, things like that? The really good days start out good with new Carnation Instant Breakfast. - Okay, wait, but there is\na little caveat in this. If you're an eight year\nold kid or a teenager, and you're in school, there actually is some useful evidence that says that eating\nbreakfast in the morning is good for your learning\nand brain development. So that's the caveat. There actually is evidence there. For the rest of us though, if you like breakfast in the morning, eat breakfast in the morning. If you're not into that, don't do it. Okay, that's it. Unless you're a kid, but I don't know how\nmany kids are watching. Okay, so that's the science on this. Turns out that I was a\nperson for many years who thought that I didn't like breakfast, that I didn't need to eat breakfast. Growing up in a small town in Oregon, I didn't have a ton of exposure to other cultures and other things, and so my version of breakfast was this. - [Man] There's a bowl of Corn\nflakes spooned from the dish. - [Man] And there was some bacon. - This is all I knew as breakfast food. When we would eat eggs\nand bacon for dinner, we were having breakfast for dinner. This food was inseparable from\nthe institution of breakfast. If you're not from the United States, let me just break down\nwhat American breakfast is and its story, where it came from. I'll split it out into two main categories of breakfast in United States. One, I called diner breakfast. It kind of looks like this, (groovy music) and the other, I will call cereal, which is everything from\nPop Tarts to Froot Loops. - Where are the Froot Loops? - I didn't bring any, help! - To granola bars, to\nCarnation Instant Breakfast. It's like the quick stuff\nthat's in our pantries that we can just consume before work. First, let's talk about diner breakfast. There's no better reference\nfor what diner breakfast is in the United States than\nthe official menu of IHOP, which is so inappropriately named as the International House of Pancakes. - Welcome to the International\nHouse of Pancakes. - At IHOP, this American institution, you can start your day with this, the Stuffed French Toast, which effectively looks\nlike my birthday cake. Or you can get really\ncultured and hop over to Italy for some Nutella crepes. Or how about the Belgian Waffle Combo, which isn't just a waffle, but also comes with bacon and eggs? Perhaps you're feeling savory, so how about this breakfast sampler, where you can eat a pig\nin three different ways, because who just wants to eat bacon when you could have all three? All of this accompanied by French fries. I mean, sorry, hash browns, but why settle for these meager options when you could go with\nthe Cinn-A-Stack Pancakes, which come layered with a\nluscious cinnamon roll filling and drizzled with rich cream cheese icing, and topped with, you\nguessed it, whipped cream. icing for breakfast. Now, here's the thing. This diner style American\nbreakfast is inspired by Europe. (bright music) American pancakes look\na lot like other sweet, flat unleavened breads that\nare eaten all over the world and especially in Europe, we just deemed necessary\nto fry it in butter and then put more butter on top, and then drizzle literal liquid sugar over top and eat it for breakfast. That was the only modification we made to this wonderful tradition\nof European pancakes. The idea of eating pork-based\ncured meats in the morning is also a European tradition. It comes from the traditional\nEnglish breakfast, which is delicious. We just decided to get rid\nof some elements from that, like the beans,\n(buzzer buzzing) and the tomatoes, and the mushrooms. Who needs those, anyway? - Where are the Froot Loops? - The American waffle\ncomes from the beautiful, delicious tradition of the\nBelgian or liege waffles, which are served in desert\nstores as desserts in Belgium. They're delicious. The modification we made was\nto eat them for breakfast, and then decide to take out the best part, which is the Pearl sugar,\n(buzzer buzzing) the crystallized sugar\nthat makes a Belgian waffle or liege waffle delicious. To summarize, this diner style\ntook European traditions, turned them into breakfast\nand modified them by making them lower\nquality, bigger portions, and usually slathering them\nwith cream and maple syrup. - [Man] All you can eat pancakes, this calls for all you can eat silverware. get IHOP's All You Can Eat Pancakes free when you buy any breakfast combo. - I mean, icing for breakfast? It just doesn't sound good. Okay, so that's the diner\nversion of American breakfast, a big, important category\nof what Americans like to eat for breakfast. The other category looks like this. (groovy music) This is the stuff that's in our pantries. This is the stuff we eat\nbefore we go to work. It's quick, it's what I\ngrew up eating as a child, let's call this the cereal category. This food came into our\nlives and became widespread because of one main\nforce: industrialization. - [Man] The factory whistle\nawakened people in the mornings and measured off their long days of toil. - With the birth of factories\nand the standardized workday, suddenly you had demand for a consistent, quick, convenient food in the morning to fuel you for the day. Paired with that, you\nalso now had technology to mass produce products\nthat would fit this demand. Perhaps the best symbol of this\nshift towards mass produced, easy, convenient breakfast\nfood is Corn Flakes? - [Man] Kellogg's Corn Flakes. - The Kellogg's corporation,\nwhich made Corn Flakes was a pioneer in making\nthis breakfast food popular. Not only because they were\nable to mass produce it and cheaply sell it, but also because they\nmarketed it in this way that made it feel like\nthe most important thing in the world. \u266a Kellogg's adds extra vitamins \u266a \u266a To make their Corn Flakes\nthe best it's ever been! \u266a (record scratching)\nBut there was a problem. Over time, people would\nlook at this lousy bowl of Corn Flakes and be like,\nwho wants to eat this? This is boring. But America had a solution. All we needed to do was\npump it full of sugar. - [Man] One big gulp of it. - Yum! - Gives me lots of energy-- - [Man] for this nutritious breakfast. (icing bursting)\n- [Man] This is how Pop Tarts have--\n- Whoa! - Geez. I mean, that's, that's pretty\naggressive right there. Wow. Yeah. That's how I feel after\nI eat a Pop Tart as well. Anyway, people started to believe that breakfast and\nespecially these commodities, which were quickly becoming\ndessert disguised as breakfast. - The ultimate fruit flavor. - Look! - Were the key to a healthy morning and a good start to the day. And soon, I was born into a world, a world where breakfast products and norms were cemented before me. A world where millions of Americans would wake up in the\nmorning and consume dessert disguised as breakfast. Your muffin is just a cupcake in disguise. That cup of yogurt might as\nwell be a scoop of ice cream. And then there's the mighty doughnut, the food that doesn't even\npretend to be breakfast. It's just literal dessert, and it's shamelessly just\nlike, hey, I'm dessert. Do you want to eat me for breakfast? And a lot of people are like, yeah. I mean, I kind of respect that. I'm kind of like, if\nyou're gonna be dessert, just represent yourself. I respect the donut. But wait, let me make one thing clear. My issues with this have\nnothing to do with nutrition, even sugar or calories or any of that. I actually have a big\nissue with our obsession with categorizing food by its numbers and its constituent parts. Not into that, I don't really care. My problem here is that\nI don't like this food. I just genuinely do not want to wake up and consume dessert for breakfast. If you do like this stuff for\nbreakfast, that's awesome. I've no issues with you and I'm not going to try to convince you to change that. - Cereal pancakes. - Yum. - [Boy] Cinnamon Toast\nCrunch, Lucky Charms and Cap'n Crunch. - Okay, so a little\nbit of time has passed, and a few things changed. Number one, I got a haircut, but number two, I think\nI'm cracking the code on how to change my breakfast experience. I spent the past few months thinking a lot about breakfast and I've\nstarted to introduce different breakfast cultures\ninto my morning routine that have really changed my world. (percussive music) I'm not gonna share all this with you now because this video would\nbe 30 minutes long, but I have been filming all of this, and it has been a really\ninteresting journey to invite different breakfast\ncultures into my world. If enough people are interested and you leave comments somewhere, I will share it and make a video about what breakfast looks\nlike for me these days. Spoiler alert, there's no icing. I still have my occasional\nbowl of Lucky Charms, which is a delicious cereal, and the occasional pancake with my kids. That's great stuff. I mean, I'm not above that food. It's just not what I want\nto eat every morning. So anyway, I'll share\nthat if you're interested. Lastly, I wanna tell you\nabout today's sponsor, which is Skillshare, which a place where I have\nlearned a lot of my video skills, but they also have cooking\ntutorials, I discovered. They have a course on\nthere about how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, which by the way, is an amazing breakfast. And it's one of thousands\nthat Skillshare has of all different types of topics, whether it is animation and video, which is all the courses I've taken, or entrepreneurship, business, photography design, basically everything. Skillshare is incredibly cheap. And for you, it could be\ncompletely free for two months. You could have access to all\nof these tutorials for free if you go to the link in my description, click that link, it helps\nsupport this channel, but more importantly, it\nkicks off your journey of learning something new\nfor free for two months. That's like two months. That's like 60 days of\nzero money playing around with this really awesome\nresource on the internet. And then after that, it's\nless than 10 bucks a month if you do the annual subscription, which is just ridiculously\ncheap for what you're getting. Thank you Skillshare for\nsupporting this channel and letting me make these videos. And thank you all for watching. I will see you in the next one. - [Man] Two eggs, four slices\nof bacon or sausage links, hash browns, toast-- - [Woman] Juice, too! - [Man] And juice, just $1.99. - Served any time of day!"

    "video_id": "e1EymGBTl-A",
    "captions": "out here in the Indian Ocean there's a lot of emptiness but if you scan long enough you'll see something right here equidistant between Africa and Australia you'll see a cluster of incredibly remote bits of land hardly peeking out of the ocean this is the Chagos archipelago a chain of around 60 remote atolls and Islands a thousand or so kilometers from any landmass there used to be people here local Islanders who lived here for many generations but those Islanders are gone now and today the main island called Diego Garcia looks like this it's a United States military base and instead of a local community of coconut farmers this island is now a little slice of America transplanted into one of the most remote places on earth but this weaponized island doesn't even belong to the United States it's technically British territory that was secretly rented to the US in a covert deal 50 years ago so what's going on here what's the deal with this American base on a technically British island and whatever happened to the thousands of Islanders that used to live on this side [Music] the British gained control of the Chagos archipelago in 1814 taking it from the French the few thousand locals that lived in this chain of Island mainly worked in coconut cultivation for European companies but by the middle of the 1900s the UN had been founded and one of the first things that it undertook was decolonizing the map basically getting all these empires to wind down their rule over their colonies so the British started leaving much of its territory abroad downsizing its empire around the same time the US was kind of doing the opposite looking to expand its military power and influence around the world they wanted a base in the Indian Ocean where they didn't have any territories so the u.s. set their sights on this archipelago specifically this main island called Diego Garcia all of these islands were a part of Mauritius which was a British colony at the time but Mauritius was soon becoming independent from Britain part of this decolonizing of the map Britain would soon be giving these islands back to the people who lived there so the u.s. made a secret deal with their allies the British at the time the British owed the United States a bunch of money for helping them develop these submarine missiles so the u.s. said that they would wipe out fourteen million dollars worth of that debt if the British could secure them this island but remember that the British were close to leaving all of these islands trying to decolonize so they pulled a fast one and told Mauritius that they could have their independence plus three million pounds if they would let the British just kind of break off this little archipelago so that the British could hold on to it even as Mauritius gained independence from Britain the reason they paid the three million pounds is so that they could technically say that they purchased the islands and appear as if they were still in keeping with the UN effort of decolonizing the map and yet they were still able to hold on to these islands for the US the US and the UK didn't sign any treaties or formally transfer any money during this process all of that would require congressional approval and public scrutiny and all of these things that would make it not possible so instead they kept the deal secret like literally secret like in the letters that they wrote back and forth they said quote there is a secret agreement and that the US would quote effectively but indirectly pay the British for these islands meaning there was no money changing hands but they still paid them by wiping out the debt and that they would be taking quote special measures to maintain the secrecy of this arrangement oh and there was the fact that this letter was officially classified as secret so yeah when I say secret I really mean secret by the late 1960s it was looking like the Americans were gonna get their base in the Indian Ocean they were ready to move in but there was still one big problem here which is that there were over a thousand locals still on this main island of Diego Garcia but in the eyes of the US and the UK this wasn't a problem in a government memo the British assured the Americans that there will be no indigenous population except the seagulls and indeed they made good on their promise the locals were herded onto cargo ships and shipped off to the islands of Mauritius and the Seychelles and they were left there in a world that many of them had never seen before to fend for themselves many had never worked outside of their Island that no skills in a way of getting work back on the island their pets were rounded up and gassed their houses left to crumble the indigenous population was gone [Music] and then the building began the US now had their base in the middle of the Indian Ocean giving them direct access to big regional hotspots like the Middle East and Asia Diego Garcia became more and more militarized with time soon it had a deep-sea port where nuclear submarines could dock and it soon took on the nickname the footprint of freedom and yet with time it became more and more secretive no journalists are allowed to visit Diego Garcia few civilians have ever arrived here and among those civilians by the way are NFL cheerleaders who came to boost morale of the troops the island was also used as a CIA black site used to interrogate suspects after 9/11 both the US and the British government's denied this and then finally admitted it we did some things that were wrong we tortured some folks after 9/11 this island became more important because it was a launch pad for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan so a new housing complex was built to accommodate the influx of soldiers this new complex is called Camp justice speaking of justice those Islanders who were forcibly evicted and deported from their Island yeah they wanted some of it so over the years they've been fighting for some form of justice and the British government has tried to compensate them sometimes with money or by giving them an option to become British citizens but even still many live in very difficult circumstances displaced from their homeland what they really want is to go back and through years of legal action they've made a strong case that they have a right to do so well the Foreign Office review its current position on the Pacheco's Islanders who should be granted immediately the right to repatriation in their home we are a currently in dispute with Mauritius about the issue of these you gaussian Islanders and about I Diego Garcia remember all those in direct payments and loopholes that the British and u.s. pulled during decolonization that stuff that they made very clear was very very secret well last year the International Court of Justice ruled that this was totally illegal and not in compliance with the process of decolonizing the General Assembly of the UN voted 116 to 6 that the UK never decolonized Mauritius because they held on to this archipelago and halt for them to immediately finish the process of returning the archipelago to the people who lived there but despite these legal rulings and this global consensus the US and the UK aren't likely to budge the UK continues to defend its claim to this island and as long as they do the US military will have a home there in this country we're doing our best to ensure that we are Asmus humane has been possibly thank you so much for watching this video there's so much more information on this topic that I was able to fit into this video but I wanted to make it four years and I finally did I want to thank story blocks for supporting this channel and for sponsoring today's video you may not have noticed but a lot of the footage that I used especially in the intro of this piece was story box footage this moment right here in the intro resume in that's all story blocks footage it's beautiful stuff and I was able to browse and find loads of stuff of the ocean and islands that I was able to use in this video i've been using story blocks for years because they really are the best place to find good stock footage and audio and After Effects templates for so incredibly cheap you have access to a giant repository of visuals that you can use to create whatever you're creating I could have never gone to the Indian Ocean to record this footage and yet on story blocks I have a huge abundance of stuff I can use so I'm so grateful that it exists and grateful that it's affordable I'm grateful that it is a subscription service so you don't paper clip you pay a monthly subscription which is incredibly cheap and then you can just download as much of this big beautiful footage as you want super high-res I can't say enough about it and again that's not just because they sponsored this video I've been using story blocks for years so I have a link in my description its story

    "title": "How Switzerland Stayed Neutral",
    "video_id": "YeAxxMZf1O4",
    "captions": "(film reeling) (dramatic music) - I want you to say something. (upbeat music) You ready? This is a giant map of Switzerland. (choir like music) I love Switzerland. And one thing I have\nlearned about Switzerland is that the Swiss like to be neutral. (somber music) This country does not like conflict. They avoid it at all costs, which is strange because\nthey're really good at fighting. Other European countries\nused to hire Swiss men to fight their wars for them. But back home in Switzerland,\nthey don't fight. They don't take sides. That's partly because they\nlost a few wars of expansion and kind of just decided\nit was probably better to just stay put. But it's also because back when\nEurope was full of empires, the big European powers\nthought it would be a good idea to have a mountainous small buffer country in between some of the big rival powers. And so Switzerland was kind\nof deemed this neutral power, but the result is that today\nSwitzerland doesn't take sides. They don't send their troops\nto fight another other wars. They rarely join alliances. I mean, they're not a part of the EU. They're not a part of NATO. And they reluctantly barely joined the UN as recently as 2002, a\ndecade after North Korea. And the only countries\nthat joined after them didn't exist before then. Meaning they came into\nexistence after 2002. So they couldn't have joined before then. Switzerland is serious about neutrality, no conflict, no alliances. Leave us alone. (somber music) When you're right here, right at the crossroads of people trying to take over Europe, staying out of conflict has\nbig benefits for your country and its economy. But it also means staying\nneutral is really hard, but the Swiss have done it. Using their mountains, some\nexceptional engineering, obsessive commitment, and a healthy amount of explosives. The Swiss have kept empires\nout of their country, sticking to their guns and staying neutral even when Europe was tearing itself apart. (somber music) So you're Switzerland in the 1940s. Here's your situation. You're surrounded by Nazi\nGermany to your North and Fascist Italy to your South and quickly are becoming engulfed with all the countries\nthat are now in the sphere of influence of these countries. You're surrounded and Hitler\nis winning everywhere, but you're Switzerland. And so you're like, don't invade us. We're not going to fight,\nwe're not taking sides. We'll just keep trading with\nwhoever wants to trade with us, but we're not going to fight or be invaded. And no, that's not how\nEurope was in the 1940s. You couldn't just sit it out. And yet the Swiss were\ncommitted to doing so. The fact is that even with\nthis commitment to neutrality an invasion from their next door neighbor, the Third Reich, was it\nvery real possibility. So Switzerland devised, what I argue is just the most Swiss plan ever. To stay neutral during World War II and future global conflicts. It's a plan that still lives on today that you can still see\nwhen you go to Switzerland. Here's what it looks like. (upbeat music) First up, hey looked around their country at any linkages to the outside. They choose key points around the country that would give invading\narmies access to the country like roads, bridges, tunnels, any access point. And then they packed\nit full of explosives. (explosion noise) Dynamite, TNT, whatever. Anything that would just\ncompletely destroy that linkage. They got really inventive with this stuff. Sometimes they would wire\na bridge with dynamite, but they also would put\nsecret canons in mountains that would pop out and point at a major road and demolish it if needed, making it unusable. Or sometimes they would\ngo to their long tunnels like this 10 kilometer tunnel down here at the border with Italy. And they would rig it with TNT so that they could\nquickly seal off this part of their mountainous Southern border. (ominous music) Up on mountain passes they even rigged the sides of mountains with explosives to create artificial\nlandslides to block the road. The thinking here is\nthat if an invading army were marching into Switzerland, they could pull the\ntrigger on all this stuff. Igniting dynamite or shelling or otherwise destroying all the ways to get into the country, making it a lot harder to invade and giving them time to\nretreat to the mountains. There's a wonderful,\nstrange irony going on here. The Swiss are really\ngood at transportation. The trains are immaculate and efficient and go up crazy mountains and are always on time. Roam around the country\nand you'll see this. These are the little doors in the streets where they would pack explosives. So it's kind of ironic that\nall of this infrastructure was packed with explosives, but I guess that makes\nit even more functional because now it's a defense mechanism. In addition to being\ninfrastructure for transportation. I love Switzerland. (jet engines) (somber music) There's this one bridge that\nconnects Switzerland to Germany that was built in 2006. And when it was built, it\nwas packed with explosives. This bridge was built in\nconjunction with Germany. Germany paved half of the bridge, and yet they didn't even\nknow that it was rigged with explosives. It's very aggressive Switzerland. Okay, so anyway. Blowing up their borders\nand sealing themselves off was one major strategy for\naggressively staying neutral. Let's get onto the next one. (dramatic music) Zoom into the lower half of Switzerland. And you'll be struck by one massive thing that Switzerland has. Mountains. Big, giant mountains that flank across the South part of the country. (dramatic music) Another thing Swiss was have is an unmatched ability to\ndrill holes into mountains. The country has over a thousand tunnels. One of which is 57 kilometers long. These people know how to\nbuild holes in mountains. And that skill becomes very useful when your situation looks like this. Most of the population lives here, meaning not in the mountains. And so there wasn't much of a separation between these population centers and Nazi Germany. After the Swiss saw\nHitler march into Paris and take over huge portions of France, they got serious about figuring out what they would do if Hitler invaded. So they had their plan\nto blow up the borders and slow down an invasion. But where could they retreat to that would allow them to stay neutral and stay alive during the fighting? In the mountains, they were\nbuilding giant fortresses and bunkers and tunnels that work literally inside of the Alps. They built thousands of these things in the side of mountains, and they rigged them with guns, and cannons, as well as full on bases that were equipped with supplies and beds and living space. Sometimes they'd be hidden\nin steep mountain passes, disguised as a barn, but really it would be a bunker with hidden explosives, supplies, and men ready to fight. All over the Alps, the Swiss\nbuilt these secret bunkers mainly during World War II in preparation for any sort of invasion. Once the war ended, the\nidea of putting bunkers in the mountains for defense and neutrality became pretty embedded in the Swiss security doctrine, as well as just Swiss culture. (upbeat music) So I did a call out on Instagram stories to see if this bunker\nculture was still a thing. And I caught a lot of\nresponses that showed me that it's not just World\nWar II in the mountains. Swiss bunkers are all over the country. (upbeat music) Geez. That's a lot of bunkers. Thank you to all of those who sent me pictures of your bunkers. After World War II, the new\nthreat was the Soviet Union and the Cold War and nuclear destruction. Bunkers were now built into\nhomes, apartment buildings, hospitals, public\ninfrastructure of all kind had bunkers underneath it. By the 1960s, Switzerland had built enough underground bunkers and shelters to protect the entire population and with a healthy surplus. Something that no other\ncountry's ever done. Okay. So let's talk about the last step here, which is kind of the dark\nside of Swiss neutrality and the one that no one\nreally wants to talk about, but gotta talk about it. (ominous music) So let me reiterate here that staying neutral and safe when this is your situation\nis a very difficult thing. I mean, World War II was\nan incredible tragedy where millions of people lost their lives. During World War II, Switzerland had an official\npolicy of neutrality. This meant that they\nwould trade with whomever. Whether it was the Axis and Hitler, or it was the Allies and Churchill. But in reality, Switzerland\ntraded a lot more with Germany, providing them with anti-aircraft guns and other military supplies and ammunition that was used in the war. In addition, Switzerland\nallowed the Nazi regime to store lots of gold and art and other valuables that\nwere looted from victims of the war. And specifically the Holocaust. Not a super good look. Defenders of this will\ntell you that Switzerland was doing what it needed to\ndo to stay out of the war, to stay neutral and just like blowing up your borders or making bunkers in the mountains. This pandering to Hitler and being kind of on decent\nterms with the Third Reich was a way of making it more costly and more implausible that Germany would just pop right down\nSouth from where they are to take over this small country. Neutrality does not mean holding hands and singing kumbaya. Neutrality in the Swiss\nforeign policy doctrine means deterrence and defense. There's a Swiss military saying that says, \"In order to remain in peace,\nyou have to have cannons.\" (artillery fire) This kind of sums it up. Not only did they have\ncannons and weaponry, but they also played by\nwhatever rules they needed to in order to stay out of the war. And it worked. Hitler had a pretty developed\nplan to take over Switzerland, but in the end it didn't\nmake strategic sense. It was too costly and implausible for them to take over their neighbor to the South. Even though he had taken over the majority of the European continent at that point. I would bet a large sum of money that the top comment on this video is someone badmouthing the Swiss for all of this World War II stuff. Which, whatever. I don't have a dog in this fight. If that's how you feel,\nthat's how you feel. (somber music) Okay. So these two massive global wars are over and Switzerland is still neutral, but they don't have to\ntake as extreme measures to remain so. So what do you do with all these bunkers? First, the bombing the borders thing, where they packed explosives\nin all of these bridges and roads and tunnels. It turns out that the military\nslowly started to dismantle all of this a few years ago. And by 2014, the military says that all of the mines and bombs and TNT have been removed from\npublic infrastructure. Good for you military. No more bombs at bridges. So for the household bunkers that were built during the Cold War, those are still there. And my friends on Instagram tell me that they're just kind of\nused for like storage rooms or sometimes like as a laundry room. Extra space, I guess, with really fortified doors that will withstand the\nradioactivity of a nuclear weapon. I mean, it's not bad to have. But what I'm really interested in is all of the mountain fortresses and tunnels, and like bunkers that\nwere in the Swiss Alps. What happened to those? Those were really expensive to build and were expensive to maintain. And the military is honestly kind of eager to get rid of them. Some of them have been sold off and turned into like fancy hotels in the side of a mountain. Others are used as cheese sellers to make delicious Swiss cheese. And then you've got this one, which was purchased by like\na tech security company that specializes in\nkeeping your data safe. So you can store your Bitcoin or whatever else you need on these super secure servers in the side of a Swiss mountain. They claim these servers are so protected that they are impervious even\nto an electromagnetic shock from an atom bomb. It seems to me like a little bit overkill, but if you have some\nreally important documents and files that you need to save, this is your place. But the majority of these mountain bunkers and fortresses lie completely abandoned. If you hike around Switzerland, you will see these things everywhere, which is something I've never done. And really now want to do. Go like bunker hunting in Switzerland. It sounds kind of amazing. All right, so the Swiss stayed neutral. They've continued to stay neutral. They will probably\ncontinue to stay neutral and it turns out that we'll\nuse whatever means necessary to do so. Thanks for watching. (upbeat music) All right, I want to tell\nyou about Squarespace.

    "title": "The International Date Line, Explained",
    "video_id": "aBppb2quqkE",
    "captions": "- A while back, I made a promise. (soft music) Someday, I'll make a video\nabout this whole messy debacle. So today I intend to make\ngood on that promise. Here we go. (upbeat music) This line is weird. It's not a border, but I guess it kind of\nis, it divides something. If it's Monday evening and you fly from Hawaii to New Zealand, you'll cross into Tuesday\nevening and then back into Monday evening and then\nback into Tuesday evening. And because you've been\nflying for a while, now it's probably Wednesday morning. You just jumped from Monday to Wednesday\non a nine hour flight. Better yet, jump in your\nboat on a Tuesday afternoon and go a few hundred kilometers south. And suddenly you're watching\nthe sunset on a Monday because you drove south in your boat. Wait what? So I want to understand this line. So naturally the first thing I do is go into After Effects and try to map it out. As I scoured the internet\nfor good data on this, I realized that everyone's\ninternational dateline is slightly different, from Google Maps to the CIA fact book, to the Pacific Island\nOcean Observing System, which is an organization\nthat has the elegant acronym of PacIOOS. Anyway, I spent the day\nscraping all the data I could, and trying to map this line. Looks like it's 195 miles\nor around 300 kilometers. That's a huge difference. There are entire islands\nwith people that Google says are on one side and\nPacIOOS say are on the other. Who's right here? Before we settle that, I want to dig into what this line even is and why it looks the way it does. Okay, so this whole crossing a line and passing over a day\nand going back in time and all of that, is a little bit hard for I know my brain to get around. And I imagine that a lot\nof you came to this video, hoping that you will leave this video with a firm grasp of what The\nInternational Date Line is. So I'm going to dive in and\nexplain it the best I can. First, let's look at\nthe earth from top down. So we're looking at the earth\nfrom above, like top down. Here's great Britain over here. And of course, we've got our beautiful sun\nshining light onto our earth which gives us day and night. Land that is rotating into\nthis light is seeing a sunrise, land that is transitioning\nout of this light is seeing a sunset. And it's the relationship to this light that we\nmeasure our time with, with noon being the point\nwhere we are right smack dab in the middle of the sun's light. So right now it's noon in Florida. Okay, you already know this,\nbut I'm setting it up here because it helps the\nDate Line makes sense. Let's go back to Britain,\nwhich is upside down right now because remember we're\nlooking down on the globe, like we're looking down at the North Pole. Also, this circle is pretty sloppy. Let's clean it up and\nmake it a nice square so you can keep your eye on it. It's important because all\ntime is measured from here, technically in a little\nobservatory called Greenwich. So let's say, here in London,\nit is the middle of the day, on a Monday. Okay, so it's noon on a Monday, the sun is shining right on London. So let's freeze time and\nlook what's happening a few thousand kilometers east of here in the middle of Russia, it's 6:00 PM. The sun is setting. It's still Monday, but the\nsun is setting on Monday. At this same moment, frozen in\ntime, over here in East Asia, we've got China and there's Japan. It's still noon in London, remember that, but it's late over here. The sun has gone down. It's 9:00 PM in Japan. It's still Monday. It's just late. The sun went down hours ago. These people are finishing Monday. It's like the middle\nof the night on Monday. It's noon in London. Let's zoom out and\nrealize that it's Monday, all around the world. The more west you go from London it is actually earlier on Monday. East of London, it's\nlate on a Monday night, like we just saw. It's later and later the more east you go. This is The International Date Line. It divides whether or not\nit's late on a Monday night or early on a Monday morning. Now let's press play on the globe and watch\nit rotate into a new day. Remember that these\nguys right here are like at 11:00 PM, basically midnight. They're about to start Tuesday. I'll keep Monday as this orange circle and I'll use green for Tuesday. Okay, press play. (upbeat music) Okay stop, zoom in, here in\nthe middle of the Pacific. It's almost 11:00 AM on Tuesday, right? You're 12 hours ahead of\nGreenwich Mean Time in London. Go right over this line and\nyou'll still be around 11:00 AM. The sun is still shining in the same way, but now you are 12 hours\nbehind Greenwich Mean Time, but it's still Monday. You're 12 hours behind Greenwich. It hasn't passed into a new day yet. And that's how you're\nable to cross this line and go back a day or forward a day, even though you only go\na few hundred kilometers. Okay. I'm sure you're tired of\nlooking at this top down globe. It's kind of disorienting\nand not super intuitive. So let's see what this\nlooks like on a map, on a regular old map. Here we are in the same exact scenario. It's around 11:00 AM right here. And yet it's Tuesday here\nand Monday over here. I'm going to call this side which is later than London's time, it's east\nof London, the Tuesday side. And I'm going to call this side, which is behind London or west\nof London, the Monday side. I'll just use that, that's\nmy own little terminology. I'm gonna start using that. And no one else uses it like that, but I'm just going to for\nthe rest of this video, okay. I'm interrupting all of this\nconceptual non-intuitive stuff for a little intermission. I want you to just look\nat this for a second. There are a bunch of beautiful\nislands in the Pacific. This one's called Aitutaki. That's really what it's called. That was my best accent. Just remember that The\nInternational Date Line runs through some of the most\nbeautiful ocean in the world, and it's worth just\nlooking at it for a second. Let's get going on this\nquestion of why it's different on every map. Why does this line look so messed up, and what's with this notch? And why can't anyone agree\non what it should look like? This is the part that\nI knew nothing about. And it's fascinating. Technically, according to\nour little conceptual model that we just did, the line\nshould just be like this, a straight line that's on\nthe exact opposite side of the world as Greenwich. Meaning if Greenwich is zero, this would be the 180th Meridian. But as I've said many times before, nature isn't super good at straight lines. So instead it looks like this. It starts out following the\n180th Meridian as it should. Then it splits off right here to make sure that this Russian Island and\nthen the very eastern tip of Russia don't get sliced in two, to become part of different days. As it accommodates Russia. It passes right here\nbetween Russia and Alaska. If you zoom in, you'll see that it passes right\nthrough these two islands. These islands are just\na few kilometers away from each other. The sun sets at the same\ntime on both these islands, they're right next to each other. The difference is the sun is setting on a Tuesday here and on a Monday here. After Russia, the line heads\nback west to meet up with the 180th, but it passes\nit in order to keep all of these islands on this side\nbecause they belong to Alaska. This notch goes all the way\nover to accommodate this island of Alaska, which is this\ntiny outpost of 21 people. It looks like the most western\npart of the United States, but really because it's on the other side of the 180th Meridian,\neverything left of this line is actually in the Eastern hemisphere. So this is technically\nthe eastern most part of the US but whatever,\nit doesn't really matter. It's all, these are all fake lines anyway. Okay, so we've zigzagged back and forth, crossing the 180th Meridian a few times to accommodate Russia\nand the United States. It finally gets back onto the 180th and starts following it\nsouth for a really long time. Once it gets to the equator,\nwe begin the big game of whose side are you on? All these islands in the Pacific and there are loads of them, have to make a decision on whether or not they want to be the\nfirst people to start new days, or the last people to end those days. We've got this big notch here which basically exists\nto accommodate Kiribati, which is an island nation\nof just like 112,000 people. But this nation is spread across a huge swath of ocean,\nwhich spans an area greater than the continental United States. It's huge. It bounces around here to\nmake sure that Kiribati is on the Eastern hemisphere time zone with Australia and Asia, and that other nations\nlike the Cook Islands are on the western part,\nlike with the United States. It dips down here between Samoa, which is on the Tuesday\nside and the islands of American Samoa, which\nare on the Monday side, same with the United States. From here, the line heads straight south, but not along the 180th like it should, instead it follows\ncloser to like the 172nd. This has meant to allow a bunch of these island nations to\nstay in the Tuesday side so that they can be on the same date as big regional countries\nlike Australia or New Zealand. Then finally it meets up\nwith the 180th Meridian and it follows it all the\nway down to Antarctica. Okay. So that is this line and why it exists and why it zigzags and all\nof its twists and turns. So our two important questions here, why does it look so weird, and why is it different on every map? The first one we can kind\nof answer pretty easily after seeing where the line goes, which is this line is really flexible. It's not a real border. It doesn't denote any\nland that somebody owns. A regular border is defined through conflict or negotiation, and it denotes the\nsovereignty of a country. You own this and I own that. That is what a normal border does. This doesn't do that. The Date Line is a decision that every country can make for itself. When they're in the\nPacific they can decide, oh, I want to be on the same\ndate as Australia and Japan, or I want to be on the same date as Hawaii and the United States. That is a unilateral decision that no country has to\nnegotiate with others to make. The Pacific nation of Samoa has decided it would be better off if it observed a time zone closer to that\nof Australia and New Zealand. So it's declared, it\nwill switch to our side of The International Date Line Before that big notch existed, half of Kiribati was in the Tuesday side and the other half was in the Monday side, which just made it really\nhard where it was like Friday on this side, and if people wanted to get in touch with people in their country, it was already Saturday on their side and so they were off for the weekend. So they unilaterally decided\nin 1995 to just change the line and put the entire country\non the Tuesday side. So every country decides\nhow they want to do it, and because of that,\nit's changed dramatically over the years as countries\njust make their own decision on what date and times\nthat they want to be in. So now to my second\nquestion and the big one that I was very curious\nabout which is who's right? After a day of fixating on this question and mapping and doing all\nthis stuff on the computer, it all came down to this moment. You have these two versions of\nthe notch that are different. The black one is Google Maps. This is how Google Maps displays it on all of their different platforms. And this yellow one is from that PacIOOS, the Pacific observer something\nI don't really remember, but it's like a big authority\nfor the Pacific Ocean. Remember that this is the Monday side and this is the Tuesday side,\nsame time, different dates. As I zoomed around this,\nI saw these islands. Google says that these islands are on the Tuesday side, the\none day ahead inside. Whereas PacIOOS says that\nthese are on the Monday side, meaning the one day behind side. I checked the official time zone for every one of these islands, and discover that they all\nbelong to the Cook Islands, which is a set of islands\nconnected to New Zealand. But that is on GMT minus 10, meaning it's 10 hours behind GMT, not a bunch of hours in front of GMT. In short, all of these\nislands are on Monday side. PacIOOS has it right, and\nGoogle Maps has it wrong. Wait, what? Google Maps has something wrong. Bit of an existential\ncrisis I've been going through the past couple of days. I want to be wrong on this. In fact, if somebody comments\nand points out a flaw in my logic or my analysis here, I will be grateful for that, because this is something that, I mean, I have a really deep\nappreciation for Google Maps and all of the wonderful\nmapping that they do, but I think they got this wrong. Somebody prove me wrong, please. And if not, my world view\nhas just shifted slightly. But here's the thing,\nat the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. The fact that Google Maps\ndidn't painstakingly weave it's line through all of these islands, is kind of an indication\nthat these borders, these fake borders, these\nlines don't actually do anything besides\ndescribe the preference on how different countries\nwant to measure their time. It doesn't give anyone extra land. It doesn't give anyone\nextra waters or minerals or any of this stuff that usually make lines really important. In this case, we're\ndescribing a preference. And so I'm sure that these\nmapping organizations haven't cared too much about\ngetting the shape perfectly in this vast swath of ocean\nthat is mostly uninhabited. That's The International Date Line. I want to hear thoughts\nand feedback from everyone and thank you for watching. So I've been home a lot lately. You probably have been to. And I've been watching a lot of Netflix and a lot of other stuff. And one thing I realized\nis that there are a lot of shows and movies on Netflix\nthat I don't have access to because I'm in the United States. Lord of the Rings for example,\nthat's where a VPN comes in. ExpressVPN specifically is the one I use. They're the sponsor of today's video. If you don't know what a VPN is, it is a service that allows\nyou to encrypt your connection to the internet so that\nyour data is secure and all of your connections\nand what you're looking at on the internet is secure. But it also allows you\nto route your connection through whatever country you want. So I'm sitting there on Netflix\nand I want to watch Lord of the Rings, suddenly I\ncan connect through Canada, and now Lord of the Rings\nis available on Netflix. ExpressVPN allows you to expand\nyour entertainment options while also keeping any work that you do online private and secure. So it's a great product I've been using it for years, well before they\ncame to me to sponsor a video. And because they sponsor this video, you can get three months of free service when you sign up for a yearly subscription if you go to expressvpn.com/JohnnyHarris. Go route your connection through the UK and watch Rick and Morty on Netflix. That's pretty cool. So anyway, expressvpn.com/JohnnyHarris. Thank you, ExpressVPN for\nsupporting this channel. And thank you for watching. I'll see you in the next one."

    "captions": "[Music] I've been playing around with a really amazing it's a map of the solar system recently I got really curious and I started to zoo me out well past the solar system and deep into the night sky and this kind of blew my mind we have mapped these stars that are so far away from us light-years away and yet here they are on this map somehow positioned in space this seems impossible to me how is it that we're able to from this little speck of dust look up and somehow gauge how far away things are like this one specific star how do we know that this is eight hundred and sixty four point three light-years away I mean that's like eight quadrillion kilometers it's insanely far the story of how we did this how we measured the distance to these incredibly faraway objects in the sky it's a story of people looking up and asking questions and in the process creating a map of the heavens in the old days people knew about the planets but they thought the stars were in some sort of vault of heaven just a bit further away than the planets so mapping the night sky this is a big topic let's start small first the stuff close to us how do we know how far Jupiter is and the moon and all of that from here the methods get trickier and trickier the further away you get but for now the solar system measuring the distance the planets is relatively easy because we see the planets move we see them spin around the Sun and we can observe their behavior over the course of decades and generations and record that after a lot of observation we realized that the planets go around the Sun and they go in this kind of elliptical shape they don't go like in a perfect circle you can then observe that the planets start moving quicker the closer they are to the Sun because of gravity gravity pulls it in and whips it around observing the planets and how they move around the Sun allowed one very smart german astronomer who apparently exclusively ate with chopsticks I'm kidding I know they're not chopsticks okay it's just a joke it's actually just like a compass hahaha anyway this guy Johannes Kepler used his chopsticks to measure all of this movement how the planets moved he plotted it and he came up with some really savvy equations and ratios and laws that gave us the average distance to each planet suddenly the night sky went from 2d to 3d for the first time which gave us a place a physical place relative to all these planets floating around the Sun okay but this is child's play when it comes to measuring distances in space these planets are like our next-door neighbors so now let's step into the big leagues and talk about how we started to map stars and their distance from Earth for the stuff that's not orbiting the Sun that's really far away we can use a concept called parallax wait a minute parallax parallax sounds strangely familiar when talking about physics and space it was alright and it was said that but he goes by the pseudonym parallax that's that great name ok no no not that parallax the pseudo scientist from the 1800s I'm talking about the scientific concept parallax is a concept that says that if you're observing something far away and you shift your position relative to that far away thing the far away thing will look slightly different relative to the background ok so let's say we're looking up at the night sky and we want to know how far away this star is remember that Earth is always floating around the Sun at any given time which is moving us in space so if we observe this star in May and then wait six months till November and observe that star again we've now gained a new perspective on the star and what it looks like relative to its background this gives us an angle that we can use to calculate this distance what we don't know is this value this is the distance this is what we're looking for but we do know a few things we know this distance because it's just the distance from Earth to the Sun which happens to be 149 million kilometers or one astronomical unit so this distance times two and then we also know this angle up here because we measured it from two different perspective thanks to the wizardry that is trigonometry we can use this distance and this angle to determine what this distance is this works really well and it's allowed us to measure the distance to a lot of stars but remember that a key ingredient to this whole parallax thing is the slight shift in perspective between the first angle and the second angle as you start to measure things that are further and further away this angle becomes slider and slider until eventually it becomes impossible to discern it's so minuscule the perspective shift that you can't actually detect it so there's a limit to how far parallax goes with our earth-based telescopes we've been able to perceive the angle enough to where we can see things that are about 300 light-years away I mean that is way bigger than like the things that are close to us in the solar system but it's still a tiny number compared to like the galaxy or the universe luckily we have fancier tools like this guy that have really good technology for detecting these slight angle differences from tooten perspectives of a star and that's allowed us to observe and measure the distance to stars that are up to 3,000 light years away way further out okay so here's where we're at with Kepler's fancy equations watching the planets move around the Sun we've been able to measure the distance to planets with parallax we've been able to measure the distance to stars that are really far away and get a 3d map of our galactic neighbors but we're still not really scratching the surface of the distances that exist in the universe so how do we do that [Music] this is where it starts to get kind of crazy and tricky and weird and I'm gonna do my best to explain this in a way that comes through so here we go one of the major methods for measuring the distance to super far away stars and galaxies was pioneered by a computer at Harvard in 1912 what a computer in 1912 yeah that's what I said a computer at Harvard in tanking but computers were invented no to the 1950s but computers in 1912 looked like this this is a group of women who worked in Harvard's Astronomy Department in the early 1900's their job title was literally computers meaning someone who executes predetermined logical calculations on large inputs of data Harvard astronomers were taking loads of photos of the night sky with their new fancy telescopes the images came out like this glass plates with photos of the night sky developed on them the computers were tasked with looking at each of these plates and naming and classifying the Stars by their brightness and their type they were basically creating a 2d map of the sky they didn't know how far away they were they just were classifying their position in the night sky relative to our perspective on earth at the time a lot of legit astronomers figured that what was in our galaxy was all there was to the universe we had no idea of knowing how far away some of these objects were so we just figured that maybe everything is somewhat close by in our galaxy one of these computers was named Henrietta she was assigned to focus on one big cluster of stars in the night sky and to look at and classify those stars she documented thousands of stars but was bothered by this one question if you look up at the night sky and you see a super bright star is it super bright because it's a big bright star or is it super bright because it's just close by by the same token if you see a really dim star does that mean it's just really really far away and it's actually a big star that's super bright or it's actually just a small dim star we really had no way of knowing because again they had no idea how far away these objects were that they were measuring she was looking at this one part of the night sky this one cloud of stars she didn't know how far away that cloud was but she figured all the stars were about the same distance from her and she noticed that some of these stars were pulsating they were getting brighter and dimmer brighter and dimmer and they were doing it at a strangely consistent rate if one of the stars took four days to get brighter and it took four days to get dimmer and four days to get brighter it would stick to that pattern that period over and over again very reliable very consistent you may be wondering what does this have to do with mapping the night sky we're getting there so Henrietta decides to make a graph to start to plot every one of these stars that are pulsating and determine if there's any sort of pattern on one axis she put how long it took for the Stars cycles to go from bright to dim maybe it was two days maybe it was five days maybe it was ten days remember that each of these stars were showing a very consistent pattern of sticking to their cycle on the other axis she plotted how bright they were at each of these phases at their dimmest and at their brightest point so you've got brightness on this side and you've got how long it takes for this pulsating to happen on this one so let's say she sees a star she sees that it takes two days for it to go from dim to bright and then two more days to go from right to dim and then at its dhimmis point it's brightness value is down here and at its brightest point it's more like up here so this is what an entry would look like for one of these stars that she's observing she did this for a bunch of stars night after night and she started to see a pattern what this graph tells us is that stars that have a really long cycle going from dim to bright let's say they take like ten or twenty days to do that those stars are overall really bright they're probably big they have more energy whereas the opposite is true stars that pulsate really quickly that maybe just take a day or a half a day to go from dim to bright dim to bright those stars are actually overall much dimmer potentially small not actually as bright and intense as these stars that take a really long time to do their cycle so now if you look at the night sky and you see a really dim star let's say you don't know if it's dim because that's just a really small star or it's dim because it's really really really far away and it's actually a super bright star but it's just super far away from our perspective so it looks dim but now with Henrietta's formula you could look at the pulsating of that star and if it's pulsating really slow taking ten days to go from dim to bright and bright to dim then you can be sure that that's actually a really big bright star that just looks dim to us because we're super far away from it this gave astronomers a yardstick that they just didn't have before to observe and understand the distance to stars that were way way outside of the previous tools that we had to measure distance it took another swath of the cosmos and took them from 2d to 3d [Music] soon after Henrietta Leavitt discovered this amazing relationship a man by the name of Edwin Hubble famous astronomer decided that he wanted to use this to settle the grand debate on whether or not the galaxy was all there was to the universe he had been looking up at the sky and been seeing this kind of fuzzy cluster of stars that he didn't really understand was it close was it far away Hubble was able to pick out one of the stars in this cluster and look at how it pulsated using Henrietta's formula it became very clear to Hubble that this little fuzzy dot in the sky was very far away way outside of our galaxy this settled the debate about whether or not our galaxy was the entire universe or not that little fuzzy spot in the sky that Hubble was looking at turned out to be the end dromeda galaxy it was a groundbreaking discovery all made possible because Henrietta Leavitt formula and at the time Hubble estimated that it was probably around 700 thousand light years away we've since honed that estimate - more like 2.5 million light years away and now using the telescope that bears Hubble's name we've been able to observe that there aren't just a few galaxies outside of our own but billions okay that's it that's the answer to my question that's how I'm able to zoom around the solar system and the galaxy using this computer program the methods I talked about here are kind of the main building blocks of measuring distance in space we're continuing to push the bounds on this there are now methods for measuring the distance to all sorts of types of galaxies all sorts of types of distances and we continue to build out a map of the night sky in 3d and I'm really grateful for that honestly I'm grateful for the pioneers who put their minds to giving us perspective because it allows me to see where I live in the cosmos and what kind of space I occupy in the night sky and for some reason that perspective knowing where the stars are knowing how far away they are just kind of has engrained itself into my mind and allowed me to keep perspective as I live my day to day life

    "title": "How to Map a Virus",
    "video_id": "ZEWbOsRgV70",
    "captions": "one of the hardest parts about containing the coronavirus is that we can't see it by using Americans to wear non-medical face coverings all we see are its effects the symptoms the spread the deaths how can you plan and prepare for something that you can't see well it turns out there is a way to see coronavirus to see how it spreads to look at its behavior there's a method for doing this and this is the story of how it works [Music] mapping an invisible killer like the corona virus is a science and an art and it's one that has its roots here in London in the mid-1800s in London loads of people were dying from some disease that no one understood it wasn't a virus like what we're seeing today but either way it was spreading and killing and no one really know how or even where it came from so they came up with a lot of theories all wrong which resulted in a lot of inaccurate health advice from using leeches to avoiding drinking cold water to a bunch of other really weird things that were totally wrong they really had no idea what was going on and yet people continue to get sick and die and then this guy shows up his proposition was fairly simple in theory if we just track every single person who gets sick and talked to them and hear what they did for the day and where they went and what they touch then we could assemble a map of this disease and understand it better this sort of data collection like mapping out sicknesses was not a huge part of medicine at the time medicine at the time was much more of a practice of smart doctors performing really technical procedures or giving health advice based on their knowledge it didn't incorporate much data science even still this guy Jon Snow was diligent in his effort to collect as much data about this invisible killer as he could the data pointed very clearly to this water pump where people were getting their drinking water every day turns out people were drinking water that was contaminated with human waste that was getting into the water source here at this pump they were being really sick with cholera that was being transmitted through water not through air this was a huge revelation and was totally made possible because John snow decided to go out and collect a bunch of data from a bunch of people fast forward 150 years and today we are kind of involved in a similar-looking puzzle the new corona virus which has now reached the United States firm that first two cases of probit 19 to a sin England donor virus yes Canada have its first case at the new corona virus the disease today is very different than cholera in the 1850s it's a virus for starters but what's the same here is that this thing is spreading around and leaving a deadly trail in its wake except for in today's case instead of trying to get visibility on a few neighborhoods in London health experts are trying to get visibility on entire countries and the entire world humans move a lot faster and further than they did in the 1850s and because of that something like this can spread a lot quicker but with that has also come new technologies that allow us to map a virus in a way that we weren't able to in the 1850s the New York Times put together this really amazing visualization using data published by Chinese telecom providers it shows people's travel patterns and helps piece together a story of how people move and how this virus left China and started to move around the world as you see the flow of people you can start to map the spread of the virus once the virus gets to your country the work of mapping it becomes a lot harder let's say you live in South Korea and you test positive for corona virus health officials interview you having you retrace your steps then they verify with GPS signals credit card transactions security camera footage to reconstruct a map of everything you touched every person you talked to buses you rode on any opportunity the virus had to jump from you someone else local health authorities are revealing the timelines and visited locations of confirmed cora virus patient's citizens are checking the coronavirus locations and are avoiding going to these areas they then isolate every person you were in contact with and interview them about everyone they touched following the trail mapping out the movements of the virus and trying to get ahead of this thing that you cannot see once in quarantine you can get an app on your phone that tracks your every movement ensuring that you don't go out and your find thousands of dollars if you do break this quarantine it's laborious painstaking resource intensive work but it's the only way to truly map a virus and get ahead of it and places like South Korea and Singapore have poured tons of resources into doing this and that's one major reason why South Korea who is 50 million people and tons of huge urban centers has a curve that looks like this whereas the United States has a curve that looks like this so why does the United States have a curve that looks like this why aren't they doing the same sort of intensive tracing that happened in South Korea or Singapore there are a lot of reasons why the u.s. is now the center of the pandemic one of the big reasons is that the US isn't totally willing to do what South Korea did in South Korea there's a pretty high trust in the government one poll found that 86 percent of South Koreans trust health advice coming from their government in the United States that's way down at 59 percent of people who trust the health advice from the US government in addition Americans aren't super into the idea of the government tracking them tracking their every movement asking them what they've been up to who they've talked to where they've been going this crosses a line of privacy and personal rights that is pretty sensitive in the United States as part of our culture and our ideology and is not as sensitive in places like South Korea so in South Korea you have people who trust the government and who are okay with the government implementing these really stringent intense methods for tracking and contain virus but honestly at the end of the day the major reason why the u.s. is not able to adequately track this virus to get ahead of it is because we're simply too late we did not act when there were just a few hundred cases and now with hundreds of thousands of cases we're too late this sort of intensive tracing the investigations that tracing of contacts takes a lot of effort and even just with a few hundred cases when you get up to hundreds of thousands of cases it becomes completely implausible and impossible to execute so for now we don't have a map of the virus we don't even have adequate testing to know exactly where it is and how it's spreading let alone containing those who have been in contact with infected people so we're flying a little bit blind which makes it that much more important for all of us to take these precautions that we've heard over and over again of distancing and facemasks this is all we can do without adequate data of where the virus has been and where it's going we have to rely on these widespread precautions to keep all of us safe and to stop the spread so don't go out wash your hands six feet away face masks etc etc without a map of the virus that's really our only hope I hope everyone watching this video has been able to stay inside and find ways to make use of all of this time not going out one thing I've been doing a lot of this learning new skills and learning about bread I'm learning new animation skills and that fits right in with a sponsor Skillshare Skillshare is an online learning platform where you can take classes on just about any topic you can think of and now is a great time to start to learn a new skill if you're into animation like I am I can recommend this course called animating with ease with Jake Bartlet it's a fantastic intro to

    "title": "MEXICAN COKE IS A LIE",
    "video_id": "PJgQEpFMptQ",
    "captions": "- Mexican Coke is just so much better. (funky investigative music) Real sugar. Everything's in Spanish. This beautiful retro bottle. (slides click) It's just better. Right? Right? It's just better. Actually, the reality is no. Something's going on with Mexican Coke and I need to tell you about it. (cool music) By the way, this video is\nsponsored by Squarespace, which I will tell you about\nat the end of the video. - [Retro Announcer 1] Ice cold Coca-Cola. - [Retro Announcer 2] A quality product made with the best of materials. \u266a Have a Coke and a smile \u266a - So we're here in our little cabin, which is actually an 1800s church, see the picture of Jesus right there, that we've turned into an\nAirbnb that you can rent out if you want. But I'm here to talk about Coke. So let me sit here on this\nold church Pew and tell you what I've learned about this Mexican Coke over the past few days of\nsitting here in isolation. Is this really Mexican Coke? I mean, it says hecho en Mexico on it, so it's gotta be Mexican Coke, right? - [Retro Announcer 1] Nothing else gives you the bracing sparkle and the bright little lip that's so delightfully yours\nthan ice cold Coca-Cola. - First off, let's talk\nabout what Coca-Cola even is and why there's a\ndifference between US Coke and Mexican Coke. I mean, Coca-Cola is like this\ngiant international company that is known for having a secret recipe that they export to every\ncorner of the globe. So why is there a difference\nbetween Coca-Colas? \u266a I'd like to buy the world a Coke \u266a \u266a And keep it company \u266a - I mean, let's go straight to\nthe source of all knowledge: Wikipedia, right? The drink's name refers to\nits original ingredients, coca leaves and kola nuts,\na source of caffeine. Wait, what? Coca leaves? I know coca leaves, but only because I rode with\na bunch of antinarcotic police in a helicopter over\ncoca fields in Columbia, busting people for cocaine production for an episode of Vox Borders. These are the people who\nare growing coca leaves. Yes, indeed. The original Coca-Cola\nrecipe included coca leaves, which is a derivative that\nis used to make cocaine, but don't worry. Your bottle of Coke doesn't\ninclude any coca leaves today, or maybe it does, or no one really knows because no one actually knows the recipe. This is not a conspiracy\nvideo about cocaine being in your Coke. I'm interested in another ingredient that is inside of this bottle. And it's the sweetener. (sniffing noise) - It's made out of sugar. - Sugar. - Sugar. - Sugar cane. - Sugar! - It's made with better ingredients. - Originally, all Coca-Cola was sweetened with the same thing, straight up sugar. Or what it's chemically known as, sucrose. But then, a few things\nhappened in the United States that changed that. First, the US government\ngot really aggressive about giving money to US\nfarmers to keep them profitable. So they started pouring\na lot of money into corn, subsidizing corn farmers\nin the United States. You can see this very\nclearly in our country. There are entire states that are basically one giant corn field. So if you're a corn farmer in the 1980s, you have every incentive in the world to just produce loads of corn, as much as your soil can possibly eke out. Unsurprisingly, what this means is that you have a major surplus of corn. Loads of corn everywhere,\nway too much corn just spilling out of every\ncorner of the United States. At the same time, the US is\nputting up trade barriers, basically tariffs, for sugar\ncoming in from other countries. So sugar became expensive. Corn became incredibly cheap. And so businesses like\nCoca-Cola did what businesses do and they rejiggered everything to find the cheapest possible option. And this is when they turned\nto a newly invented sweetener that came from corn and\ntasted sweet like sugar, but was chemically very different. Sugar is sucrose. That's its kind of chemical name. This new corn sweetener\nwas glucose and fructose, but it was still very sweet,\nbut it came from cheap corn. And they started to use that\nto sweeten their Coca-Cola in the United States. Enter high-fructose corn syrup. - [Retro Announcer 3]\nDid you know that corn, one of America's favorite foods, is used to make America's favorite syrup? A wholesome kind of sweetness\nthat comes from corn. - Look what happened to\nhigh-fructose corn syrup production in the United States versus\nsugar in the 80s and 90s. High fructose corn syrup\nbecame the obvious choice because it was way cheaper\nand Coca-Cola started using it to sweeten their drinks. So this is how you get\ntwo different Coca-Colas. The United States producing Coke that is made with high-fructose corn syrup and the rest of the\nworld, including Mexico, without any of these trade\nrestrictions and corn subsidies, continuing to use cane sugar\nto sweeten their Coca-Cola. And then the taste wars begin. (funky upbeat music) - Ooh. - It's actually a lot better. - [Man Offscreen] It's the sugar. Got a natural. - Not all syrup-y. - Soon, Mexican Coke became a\ndelicacy in the United States. It was only sent to places that\nhad big Mexican populations or other immigrant populations that were used to this cane sugar Coke. And so it became rare and\nhard to find and obscure. Not surprisingly, hipsters\nlike me got really into it. It was authentic, and it\nwas the original recipe, and it was hard to find, and it was in this retro glass bottle. It felt like some\ncommodity was being like, sent from the other side of the border in this kind of renegade way and we were getting in on it. It tastes so much better\nwith that cane sugar. - [Male Voice] Man, that stuff is so good. - It won't feel like corn\nsyrup all over in my guts. - Just have a much smoother,\nmore delicious taste. - So much better. So much better. But wait, this is where it\nstarts to get really weird. In 2010, a group of legit\nscientists get together to do a legitimate experiment for a legitimate science journal. And they want to test soft\ndrinks, including Coca-Cola. They want to know what sorts of sweetener are being used for each and\nhow much of that sweetener is in each of them. So they gather a bunch of soft drinks, including a Mexican Coca-Cola\nand an American Coca-Cola. And they do all of their testing. And what they find is\nthat the Mexican Coca-Cola actually has no sucrose\nin it, meaning sugar, all they find in this\nis glucose and fructose. The elements that are used to build high fructose corn syrup. What? In the Mexican Coke that\ncame from a Latino market in east LA, they found no sugar. They only found the elements\nfor high fructose corn syrup. What is happening? This is supposed to be sugar! It says on the ingredients it's sugar, but it tastes so much better. It's different. It tastes so much better, right? (suspenseful music) Better, right? (sighs) It gets weirder. In 2013, Mexican lawmakers\nbecame very concerned with the obesity rate in Mexico, which is considered by\npublic health officials as quote, \"the fattest\ncountry in the world.\" Not my words, theirs. (dramatic music) Mexico has a big obesity problem. And one of the links to that is the massive amount of\nsugar that is consumed. Mexican legislators\nslapped on a tax for soda. All soda was going to be subject to a tax, which made it more expensive to produce, which sent Coca-Cola\nlooking for cheaper options to bottle their Coke and cheaper options equal high fructose corn syrup. As of 2013. Okay, we're talking like seven years ago, more and more bottlers\nof Coca Cola in Mexico, serving Mexican markets, are\nusing high fructose corn syrup to sweeten their Coca-Cola\nand selling it in Mexico. So now even legitimate Mexican Coke is not even Mexican Coke anymore. It's identical to the high\nfructose corn syrup stuff you buy here. One of the main bottlers came\nout and said, don't worry. We're going to continue\nto send cane sugar Coke to the United States because we know that people really like\nit in the United States and we'll to send it because\nit's good business for us to keep making it with cane sugar. But I don't even believe that\nguy because of that study. Remember the study that said no sucrose, only glucose and fructose. Ie. high fructose corn syrup. I don't believe you, Mexican bottler. I don't believe that you're sending us cane sugar Coca-Cola anymore. Not surprisingly, Coca-Cola\nhas caught onto this idea that people like me love Mexican Coke and they've totally leaned into it. They've created this gimmicky branding that's like, hecho en Mexico. Here it is. Here's the offending product. Bought it at target. It's just sitting here,\nbeing so tokenizing of Mexican aesthetic and culture. Okay, back to it. Authentic original flavors. And they've really leaned into it because they know that\nthere's a cult following of people like me, who\nwill pay more money. Okay, so I've been social\ndistancing out here in this cabin in the\nwoods for like two weeks. I have been reading way too much about the Coca-Cola bottling industry. And it has completely\nshattered my identity as a Mexican Coke drinker. One because there's probably\nnot even sugar in this, and two because Mexicans don't even drink Mexican Coke anymore. They drink high fructose corn syrup. Cool. I guess there is still one reason why I would drink Mexican Coke, Because it still comes in\nthis cool retro glass bottle that makes me feel\nreally cool about myself. And that is why I will\ncontinue to drink it. Thank you. - Cheers to y'all. - And now let me sit by\nmy wood burning stove and tell you about Squarespace. It is a website builder, but it's more than a website\nbuilder, I'm discovering, as I build my own website.

    "title": "The Longest Border in the World",
    "video_id": "Vvvicd07zCs",
    "captions": "(birds chirping) (water whooshing) (soft music) - The longest border in the\nworld is kind of strange. (soft music) It goes on for thousands\nand thousands of miles, in like a straight line. And there's a bunch of weird\nlittle details about this line that I'm becoming quite curious about. This is the border of the\nUnited States and Canada. (soft music) Yeah I know, two Canada videos in a row. I'm just really into Canada lately. And Canada has got some\nweird stuff going on and it's kind of just\nlike neighbor to the north that no one ever talks about because it's seemingly\njust not that interesting, but it actually is really interesting. That's what I'm here to tell you. So let's do this. (upbeat music) - How is it looking up there, Dr. Chris? (upbeat music continues) I spent the weekend in Vancouver, BC hanging out with some friends. My friends, Chris and\nLizzie and Becky and Chris who are just gems of people. Really fun to hang out with, very talented creators. Iz, what are we up to? Where are we? What's going down? You can say it loud. Izi say it loud. (crosstalk) - We're getting ramen,\nbut I'm gonna say it - Okay ready, ready. - [Host] Okay go\n- Great, three, two, one. - [All] We're getting ramen. - That worked out really well. And there was lots of FPV drones. (upbeat music) - Did you just crash it? - I'm very far away. (air whooshing) Do you hear it? - And while on this trip, one of the things I did\nwhile we were driving around is what I always do, which is, pull out my\nphone and started looking at the map of where we were. (gentle music) - And I just started to get\nreally curious about this line, this straight line that goes\non for thousands of kilometers. It's like 6,500 kilometers\nworth of line on the map. And I've always just ignored\nthis line. It's kind of like, Oh, that's just like the boring line that separates these two countries that are like best friends and have no tension, no drama or nothing interesting about this line. It's just straight and boring\nis what I always thought. Then the rabbit holes began. (upbeat music) There's actually some\nreally interesting stuff about this line like weird enclaves and a Skype border patrol and all this stuff that I'll explain in just a second. But first let's remember why I'm here. I came to explore and to have\na good time with my friends. (upbeat music) (crosstalk) (upbeat music) Okay, so back to this line. There's a whole history here. I don't know if you're interested in the history lesson right now. I'm not. So let's just put it this way. A lot of Canada used to\nbe owned by the French, (typewriter clicking) Fought some Wars with Britain, they lost the wars and\nthey were kind of like, nah, we'll just like\nkind of surrender Canada. French writer, Voltaire\nkind of hated Canada said it was \"Just a few acres of snow\" So the British take over Canada, the United States is starting\nto expand to the South. They wanna take over tons of land. They want to go north\nand take over Canada, but the British don't really\nwant them to take over Canada and they fight and they end\nup not taking over Canada. And eventually they establish a line between north and south that says, this is Canada and this is United States. Through a bunch of treaties, they determine exactly\nwhere the line's gonna be. (gentle music) There's one number that\ncompletely determined how this border would look. And that number is actually the same name as this coffee shop that we're\nin right now in Vancouver, (gentle upbeat music) Forty Ninth Parallel. (gentle upbeat music) (dry leaves cracking) This is not stable. I had this big vision\nof sitting on this log. I don't think it's gonna work. (exhales deeply) Am I contributing to erosion\nwith all of this traipsing through the woods? Here they go. They've got a line. They've got a number, the 49th Parallel. (soft music) This is like the 1800s,\nthey don't have GPS. In fact they don't have any precise tools for actually measuring\nwhat that line looks like when you're in the mountains of Canada. So they send a bunch of\npeople out with string. They made a bunch of straight\nlines that were supposed to go along the 49th Parallel. And I mean, they did\na pretty darn good job for just like using string and compasses. I'm actually pretty impressed, but not surprisingly, if you zoom into this very straight line, you'll see that there's\nactually a little bit of zigzagging going on. The border doesn't actually go perfectly along the 49th Parallel. To demarcate the border, they put thousands of these stone markings and then they also, to make it very clear, cut a gap in the trees\nthat's like 20 feet wide. It's kind of a bizarre-looking thing, especially from space. You just see this like gap in the trees. (upbeat music) To write the end of it,\ncontinental United States, is gonna be south of the 49th Parallel and Canada would be north\nof the 49th Parallel. This is a great thing when\nyou're looking wide at a map, but nature isn't super\ngood at straight lines, which is why when we draw borders, it kind of clashes sometimes with how the world actually works. And so you get some weird stuff (upbeat music) First over here in Vancouver,\nzoom into Vancouver, and you'll see this little peninsula. This little peninsula is great, just like any other peninsula. But look what happens when you draw the 49th Parallel through it. This is Point Roberts. It's a little enclave that\nbelongs to the United States because it's South of the 49th Parallel. But you can see that it's\nlike, should be in Canada. (upbeat music) It's cut off from the US. This little town of like 1500 people is strange because there are people living\nthere who are US citizens. They belong to the State of Washington. (gentle upbeat music) They have a little elementary\nschool in this village, but what they don't have is anything above an elementary school. So anyone who wants to go to\nschool has to get on a bus, go across the border into\nCanada all the way around like 40 kilometers or something like that. Back in the United States, go to school. And then back across into Canada and back into the United States. It's like four border\ncrossings in one day. Sounds like a nightmare. (upbeat music) Listen, I know we're talking\nabout the US-Canada border and everything but just take a minute to look at this mossy green forest that I'm in north of Vancouver. It's just the most magical\nthing I've ever seen. - I'm really know far away (both laughing) - [Lady] So far away - Can you hear it? (upbeat music) - [Host] Is everyone convinced that moss is the greatest thing in the world yet. - Yeah, of course. - [Host] On the record?\n- I was on board. - [Host] Yeah, you've been\non board since the beginning. - I was on board from the begins. - [Host] You're on board now, hater. - I'm on board. - [Host] I've got everyone on board. - Listen, (indistinct) the whole time - Shut up Becky. (upbeat music) - Okay. So back to this line, keep going down the straight line. And eventually you'll hit an area where the whole straight line, 49th Parallel thing doesn't really work as a place to draw border. The treaty says that as soon\nas this 49th parallel hits this Lake, it's called Lake of The Woods that the border would need to trace the Northwest corner, meaning the upper left\ncorner of this border, and then continue onward.\nBut there was a problem. The map they were using\nto draw this border was kind of bad and inaccurate. And so it made the lake\nlook a lot more round and cleaner and like more in line with their vision for the border. But then when they went\nto actually survey it, they realized that this northwest\ncorner of the upper left was actually way up here, (gentle music) making the border have to\ngo up to fulfill the terms of the treaty and then continue onward. From there it starts to follow rivers and it goes into The Great Lakes. And it's a little more complicated, but in the process of going\nup to fulfill the treaty and hitting the upper left of this Lake, you get this, (gentle upbeat music) this little blob of land\nis appropriately named The Northwest Angle. It's the only piece of the\ncontinental United States that is north of the 49th Parallel. There's a couple hundred\npeople who live there and if they want to get in\nand out of their community, they have to go to this little booth and they have to video-call like Skype the border patrol to like report that they're coming in and out and declare whatever stuff\nthey wanna bring in and out. That's so cool. It's like Skype border patrol. Sounds cool. I should do that someday. (upbeat music) We went into this sea-plane in Vancouver and we flew over all of these islands. (upbeat music) And I started to realize\nthat while it works to draw these really straight lines in the middle of Canada, when you get to the east\nand the west coast in the Canada region, you start\nto get a lot of little islands, lots of water weaving\nin and out of violins, cutting them all up. And that's hard to draw lines through. Luckily on the west coast, they were able to not stick\nwith the 49th Parallel, which would have cut Vancouver Island, just in a weird place. They\ndipped it down and whatever. But over on the east\nside, they didn't do that. And you end up with this line. (upbeat music) This is Canada, but the only way to get into Canada from here is through this land bridge that goes\nthrough the United States. Kinda weird, probably\nnot that big of a deal. In fact, none of these\nare actually a big deal. Like they're all like kind\nof goofy, weird things, but they don't actually cause\nlike too much inconvenience. Although the high schoolers\nhaving to go through four border crossings every\nday is actually pretty weird and a huge inconvenience. So I take back what I just said. So it was a great weekend in Vancouver. I loved hanging out with\nthese wonderful people and I learned a little\nsomething about this big, straight line that I\ndidn't know anything about. And it confirmed to me\nsomething that I've learned time and time again, which is some lines on the\nmap look really simple. And they just look like straight lines, but you zoom in enough, you'll always find weird stuff. So it's always interesting to zoom in that's I guess the moral of the story. Anyway, thanks for watching. (upbeat music) Alright. I'm gonna do an\nad now about something that I care a lot about, which is Audible. I listen to a lot of Audible\nand I have since 2011 as this giant library\nof now hundreds of books that really have changed my world since I'm able to read a\nlot more, I'm dyslexic. So reading is like a\ndifficult thing for me. And now I listen to books and\nit really has changed my life. I know it sounds dramatic,\nbut it's actually true, but I'm not gonna go into it anymore. Audible is a giant repository\nof more audio books than any other library in the world. It's really great. If you sign up with Audible, you get a free book every month. One of my favorite parts about Audible is if you start a book\nand it's not for you, you can like easily\nexchange it and return it and get a new one plus\ntwo Audible originals, which is like their original content that you can choose two of every month.

    "title": "Why Canada's Mountains Feel Like Switzerland | Banff, Lake Louise, and Sunshine Village",
    "video_id": "eOa1zbBureI",
    "captions": "I become obsessed with the country of Switzerland and Swiss culture and everything Swiss and so I decided to come to Canada I'm in the Canadian province of Alberta and I'm surrounded by mountains by these evergreen forests by no and ice and winter sports and it's just gorgeous as someone who's recently become obsessed with Swiss culture I keep seeing Swiss things here and it's like what's going on here these are the Canadian Rockies it's like this part of Canada it's right on the Continental Divide which is right where these tectonic plates are coming together so it's this giant mountain range [Music] if you rewind back to 1800s this mountain range was basically empty people hadn't explored it it was just here doing its thing and son of it accessible but these mountains were on the cusp of a revolution Canada wanted to start to build access into these mountains mainly with trains [Music] there's a huge company in particular Canadian Pacific that was building a giant railway across all of Canada including this mountain range with these railways came this dream of a future where people could actually visit the mountains so they built hotels really fancy hotels [Music] but let me tell you it's really hard to navigate through mountains like this building trains and getting into the mountains and exploring them is a dangerous and difficult activity so you have these early pioneers of mountaineering in Canada who are going and like charting these mountains going up peaks for the first time helping the railway build infrastructure guiding the first tourists through these mountains by the end of the 1800s they were starting to explore these mountains and then there was an accident this renowned climber was going up this huge peak to explore it for the first time when he slipped and fell to his death this was the first recorded death from mountaineering in all of North America where mountaineering was like a fairly new thing and it was a big deal it kind of shocked people and it made them realize that if they were gonna chart these mountains and properly explore them they needed help from the experts in mountaineering which were at the time the Swiss Canada had everything Switzerland had in terms of mountains in fact the renowned English climber who is the first person to summit the Matterhorn yes the Matterhorn when he came to the Canadian Rockies he said that this place was quote 50 Switzerland's in one so they had the mountains they just didn't have the mountain expertise which is why they brought in the Swiss so they started hiring Swiss Mountain experts to come teach them the ways of trains and mountains and tourism they called these Swiss guys sturdy picturesque fellows man if I could just be considered a sturdy picturesque fellow I'm not sure there's any higher compliment I am on a lake ice skating surrounded by stunning mountains stunning forests this stunning structure behind me this is Lake Louise nestled up here in the Rockies I can't stop looking at these mountains they are just the Swiss were the experts of this they had the knowledge and they pass it on to their Canadian brethren this chateau became the base camp base for a lot of this climbing expedition education learning how to climb learning how to navigate these mountains learning how to access this and over the next 50 years there wasn't a single fatality in all of the exploration that happened in this area to make way for tourism and it really left a mark on the culture here so over the course of the 1900s the Canadian Rockies became discovered they built roads hotels resorts and the Canadian Rockies once inaccessible became a major part of the Canadian identity and today this mountain culture has taken on a life of its own it's now uniquely Canadian it's expanded and grown in really amazing ways but it's important to remember that the Swiss helped build it I've been reading this book by this Canadian historian who said that quote it was the swiss guides who made manifest the meaning of having so many beautiful mountains eventually a lot of these swiss guides went home but the swiss influence is 100% still here you can see the influence from those early days when those guys were here teaching the canadians how to access their mountain today there are 15 peaks in the canadian rockies that were given swiss names but it's not just the names of mountains there is a very swiss institution a thing that i wanted to try for a really long time very swiss i've never tried it and i'm going to try for the first time tonight in canada here we go [Music] this is fondue film TV if I were speaking French but I don't speak French materials fondue is basically a Swiss format where you put a communal pot in the middle of the table with a portable stove that heats it up and you put different kinds of cheese in that pot and it melts it down into this like creamy liquidy wonderful path of goodness and then you start dipping and it's again this kind of communal experience it's like hotpot but like with cheese totally a Swiss thing like 100% like originates in Switzerland in in Canada fondue gets a ten out of ten must do you must do fondue that's my new motto must do fondue why are you making that Rufus must do fondue open she's gone is was it not cool in the 1950s a constant supply of Swiss Mountain gear started flowing into the Canadian Rockies and that's because of this guy John Monnett who is one of the swiss guides who was here as a ski instructor and he saw the need for quality gear that was not available here in North America at that time was only available in Switzerland and so he started to bring stuff back from Switzerland high-quality climbing gear and apparel and clothing and boots and it really caught on as this mountain culture was developing he saw a giant demand for this stuff and he started a store that store is right behind me and today it's one of the major retailers of sports and outdoor equipment some of that Swiss legacy right here on vamp Avenue I mean that's just full-on like Swiss architecture galore like that you don't get more Swiss than the net okay it was in the 1960s when a Swiss company brought in not only chairlifts themselves but employees who knew how to build and operate them that helps spread Mountain infrastructure all throughout the Canadian Rockies so today if you go skiing or snowboarding here you are partaking in some of that Swiss influence [Music] in the 1920s there was the Swiss immigrant who came here he was a mountaineer guy Sam was John just like me my name is John he saw this mountain behind me and he's like I'm tired of seeing people carry up supplies to the teahouse at the top of this mountain there needs to be a cable car like we have in Switzerland but no one wanted to pay for it couldn't raise funds so he went back to Switzerland and he got a bunch of business people to fund this project and before you know it this gondola was built let's go up it and see what it looks like you want to go up the gondola sweetie you're heavy don't grow up not only was this created by a Swiss person and funded by Swiss capital but it's also run today by Swiss infrastructure it's a Swiss company that actually designs and manufactures these cable cars and this whole system it doesn't get any more Swiss than this but we're here in the cave [Music] I'm super happy that we were able to take this trip to uh porta this is my first time here and I had no idea what I was missing out on the Tourism Board travel Alberta reached out to us and asked if we wanted to come explore this place and he said yes they had no influence over the videos we made they just told us to make whatever video we wanted based on our trip and as I started to poke into this kind of Swiss influence I became insatiable fascinated and went down many rabbit holes bought many books bought many maps so thank you travel Alberta for sending me down this rabbit hole is also made a video that's more of a Travel Guide of everything that we did while we were here kind of a day-by-day so you should go over and check that out and thanks for watching Switzerland in North America I love it [Music]"

    "title": "Why People Think the World is Flat",
    "video_id": "IwJzsE8CvzQ",
    "captions": "(film reeling) - [Johnny] If you were able to\nlook through the perspective of a person who thinks the world is flat, you would see this. The North pole is right\nhere in the center, the continent's splayed\nout over this plane. And here on the edges, you'd\nrun into 150 foot wall of ice, guarded by NASA employees with guns. - [Recorded Speaker] And how\nfar that ice goes outwards. And, when people have\ntried to go down there, they get turned away at\ngunpoint and put in prison. - [Johnny] The heavens are a dome that arcs over the flat earth. The sun, the moon, the stars, they're all just little\nballs of light in the sky that move around just\nabove the earth's surface. There are loads of people\nwho actually believe this. YouTube channels and Facebook pages. You'll see hundreds of\nthousands of followers. Google searches for the\nterm flat earth proof over time look like this. It's become incredibly popular. And recently, a poll showed that only 84% of Americans agree with the statement, \"I have always believed\nthe world is round\", 84%. And if you're 18 to 24,\nthat's more like 66%, which is like dangerously close to half. What is going on here? - Now, the North Pole, is the center of a deep ocean. Whereas the South Pole, is the center of a high plateau, which averages seven or eight\nthousand feet in altitude. This is frustrating! And, what's even more frustrating is every time I try to look into this and understand it, all I see is coverage of like, flat earther conventions and like, interviews with these people. - We absolutely know for\na fact this ain't it. - These interviews are interesting. but I wanna understand like, how someone with a thinking brain can actually get behind this. What is this actual belief? Where does it come from? And, how do potentially millions of people believe that the earth is flat? - [Recorded Male Speaker]\nThe water is completely flat as far as we can see and\nas far as we've measured, and the horizon is completely flat. - I'm in Mexico now. I've been sitting on the beach, reading everything there is to read about the history of people\nwho believe the earth is flat. There's one thing that I\njust had to try for myself. This is a simple experiment that anybody can conduct to determine definitely\nthat the earth is flat. Grab a spirit level and\ntake it on a plane with you. (speaking Spanish) - Found this hardware store, bought myself a level. Gracias amigo. - One of the stranger\nthings we've ever done. - And I'm bringing it\nwith me on the airplane. I'm gonna do some of this\nempirical science myself. If you are to fly on a non rotating earth, please explain what kind of experience will a pilot really have? The logic goes that if the earth is round and I'm flying thousands of miles, which I'm about to do, then the airplane will have\nto be tipped a little bit the whole time in order to make it around the curvature of the earth. - The plane should be constantly\ndipping its nose forward in order to compensate for the curvature. - Show me some planes doing this! - I would be able to see\nthe tilt of the airplane. If I put my newly purchased level on the tray table in front of me. - I'm gonna take my spirit\nlevel onto the plane. - If my tool shows me that\nthe plane is totally leveled- - That's proof that the earth is flat. - Let's go see what happens. Can somebody explain to me, duty free? Why perfume? Why is there so much perfume in duty free? Four hours on an airplane and I'm back. My little level experiment\nworked wonderfully. The bubble stayed nice and center, turns out the plane was\nnot dipping its nose in order to (laughs)\nmake it around the earth. This is explained by the\nbasics of gravity and physics. This video is not a debunk\nof flat earth theory. That doesn't need to happen! That shouldn't need to happen! What this is, is my fascination with the fact that\nthere is lots of people. Let's put it this way, a non zero number of humans who think the world is flat! And, they work really hard to prove it. I wanna understand what sorts of tools are being used to prove the world is flat. So, here we go. (spacey music) I wonder if I can get some really dramatic like, conspiracy theory\nlighting going on here. I've seen all the evidence. What if the earth actually is flat? The plane wasn't dipping,\nthe level was flat. Okay, I'm kidding! Let's get into this. I've been in the weeds, learning about the flat earth experience, what people believe and why, and where it all came from. And, here's what I've learned. Number one, flat earthers\nhave become a thing just in the past couple hundred years. So, by like 205 BC, you've\ngot these really smart Greek people making experiments that are like, observing a globe shaped earth. Over the next several centuries, eventually this would just\nbecome the widespread thing among anyone who was doing\nexperimentation on the world. And eventually, nobody\nbelieved the earth was flat. Even in like the medieval times. Like, it was a consensus\nthat the earth was a globe. So in short, flat\nearthers, weren't a thing during this time, even though literally, in elementary school, I was\ntaught that Christopher Columbus and like, his voyage was somehow to prove that the earth was round\nor maybe it was flat. And that there was like,\nsome debate around that. That's actually a total legend! And, I have no idea why I was taught that in elementary school. How did that happen? I actually am genuinely curious,\nlike, how did that happen? The fact is Christopher\nColumbus, the Catholic church, the Spanish patrons, no one\nthought the earth was flat but then they became a thing, any sort of flat earther movement\ndidn't actually come around ironically until science was\nreally starting to heat up. During the mid 1800s a huge amount of scientific breakthrough was happening. The scientific method was taking off and huge breakthroughs in biology, physics, anatomy, and\nmathematics were taking place. But, at the time there were also people who were becoming\nuncomfortable with how advanced scientific methods we're getting. These guys were like, \"Hold on a second. \"You have all these fancy\nnew tools to inquire \"into the world and to understand reality. \"But, these tools are getting like, \"too sophisticated and too\nabstract and theoretical. \"They're becoming too disconnected \"from like, what I can see and understand \"and touch and feel.\" They wanted to bring science back to what it had been\nfor a really long time, which is that like, a person\ngoes out, uses simple tools like a telescope to look at the world and to make conclusions\nabout how the world works. So, it's the 1800s, science is like, having it's time. And, you have these\nguys, usually from like, the U.S. and the UK who want to throw out this growing body of like,\namazing advancements in science. And they start to do experiments. Here's what those experiments looked like. (upbeat music) So, it's the summer of 1838, England up in the County\nof Cambridgeshire, which literally sounds like a place in the Lord of the rings. So, it's the summer of 1838. And, the Atom had just been discovered and the Doppler effect is\nlike, being flushed out. And then, you've got this guy, his name is Samuel Rowbotham, but he goes by the pseudonym Parallax, which is actually a pretty dope name. Like, if I were a DJ, I would totally go with like, Parallax! Anyway, Parallax decides, even though all this science is happening, he thinks it's time to\nreopen up the debate about whether or not the earth is a globe, which was like literally settled\nthousands of years earlier. But he's like, \"No, let's do it!\" And, he finds this canal system\nthat is incredibly straight. This canal goes on for\nalmost 10 kilometers, like six miles of just a straight line. This guy says, \"If the earth is a globe \"and people say it's 25,000\nmiles in circumference, \"then if I look at a straight line, \"after the first mile the\ncurvature of the earth would mean \"that the canal would now\nbe eight inches lower. \"After two miles, it\nwould be 32 inches lower. \"After three miles, 72 inches lower.\" Meaning like, six feet,\nalmost two meters and so on. So, he thinks eventually\nthe dip from the curvature of the earth would be so great that you could easily observe it. (puzzling music) So, he gets in the water, he puts a telescope right above the surface of the water and then puts a boat on the canal with a one meter tall post on it. So, what he wants to see is if the earth is curved, if it's a globe, this post will start to\ndisappear over the horizon. So, he does it. The boat goes away. It goes the entire six miles of the canal and it stays\nin sight the entire time. It doesn't dip over the horizon. And, he's stoked! He's like, \"Man, I just\nproved that the earth is flat. \"And I did it with a\ntelescope and a boat.\" Like, screw you science! Like, I'm making breakthroughs\nright here in Cambridgeshire! And then, he writes this book, where he flushes out this experiment and several others that he does. But wait, this experiment's like, kind of legit, right? It adds up, like his\nnumbers were all correct about the circumference\nand the dip of a curvature. Like, why didn't it dip? Like, why was the boat still in sight? There's nothing wrong\nwith this experiment. Parallax, got that great name! Maybe he was on to something! (beep) No, no, this is stupid! This is like a third\ngrade science experiment in your backyard! This experiment doesn't take into account how the natural world actually works and how light behaves and refracts based on the\ndifferent air densities! This is like stuff that\npeople already figured out. And like, Parallax is\nsitting there getting wet in a canal, like trying\nto observe this on. No, this does not prove anything! But Parallax didn't\nwanna hear any of this. He didn't wanna talk about\natmospheric refraction and air density and how light\nbehaves in different media. Too complicated, too abstract. You can't touch and feel that stuff. Instead, Parallax sees\nscience and observing reality as a much simpler task. In his book, he says, \"Nature speaks to us \"in a peculiar language, in\nthe language of phenomenon. \"She answers at all times the questions which are put to her.\" Just like, go out and like, put a question to mother\nnature and she'll answer it. As scientific methods\nbecome more sophisticated, they become harder for\nyou and me to understand. Parallax and his canal experiments are a reaction to all of this. They are a call for a simplification of scientific methods and\nto return of the senses as the primary force for\nunderstanding reality. He called his method of\nreductionist pseudoscience the Zetetic method. He says that honesty of thought is to look at truth in the face, not the side face, but the full front. Like, just like look at it, go out and observe it for yourself. He was among several scientists and mathematicians at the time who were on this train of let's use really simplified reductionist math and science to prove that the earth is actually flat. This argument of the flat earth flickered for a little bit in the 1800s, gained a little bit of traction, but then eventually it died out, until just a few years ago. - I refuse to be another vegetable. Pseudoscience garbage will\nto me be unacceptable. Anyone with eyes to see\ndon't have to be susceptible. Dispose of your globe in the\nnearest waste receptacle. - There is no curvature to this earth. There is no motion to this earth. - If you just accept the globe\nmodel with no understanding of the flat and no clear\nevidence for the ball earth, do you see the problem there? - Flat earthers are back and their methods are very similar to what Parallax was doing in the 1800s. - And this is data! This is repeatable,\nobservable, measurable! - If you take the time to learn,\nyou will change your mind. There's no doubt. The only reason people think they live on a spinning\nball is willful ignorance. - They're still zooming into horizons, but now they have hoards of visual stuff to play around with. They now have airplanes. They now have satellite\nimagery to play around with. They now have the moon landing to dissect. And now, they're taking levels\nonto airplanes, like I did. - Your plane can't go upside down! Here's the thing, globe hugger! - Like the flat earthers in the 1800s, the flat earthers today want\nto use their own intuition and senses to understand reality. And in the process, they reject and ignore the huge body of science\nthat we all live with today. - So, people that have physics\ndegrees, astronomy degrees, they got their degree by regurgitating what their teacher or the books told them. - Instead of trigonometry, and telescopes, and canals, the flat\nearthers was today use videos and photos circulated on the internet. - The isothermal\nequidistant projection map that the U.S. GS actually uses is the flat earth map. - Wait, did he just say\nisothermal equidistant projection, that's like my favorite projection. Is that the flat earth map? Don't (silence) with me and projections, I take them very seriously! In true internet fashion, this new current movement of flat earthers has become just a bunch of\nbumper sticker type assertions and images that are really easy to share. Just like Parallax's experiments, these methodologies completely ignore the way the natural\nworld is observed to work by like, thousands of years\nof scientific consensus. But, if you go to the FAQ\npage of the Flat Earth Society you'll see what they're after here. They believe that evidence is, quote, \"Relying on your own senses\nto discern the true nature of the world around us.\" That's the best evidence. And in that vein, that's\nwhat these people are doing. - I mean, so in the physics world today, do they not understand that convex lenses or fish eye lenses or\nGoPro add a distorted view? - So, what have I\nlearned from all of this? From my understanding,\nthe flat earther movement, whether from the 1800s\nor today on the internet is actually not totally\nabout the shape of the earth. This movement has a much\nbroader message built into it. There's a reason why 1984 is like, in the cannon of the\nflat earther movement. 1984 has nothing to do with\nthe shape of the earth. What it does have to do\nwith is being skeptical of big institutions that\nare probably watching you, that are probably controlling your life, that are probably feeding\nyou bad information to retain power. - Well, we're not crazy,\nwe're just sick of the lies. - Here's the thing, most of the knowledge we\nhave about the natural world and the universe, we've never seen. We've never seen exoplanets or the deep space telescopes that tell us so much about our universe. Instead, we read about this stuff. We benefit from its findings. We pay our taxes to fund more of it. Science is like a tall tower and each individual\nresearcher and institution adds a little brick to that tower. Each brick resting on the one below it. No one person sees or\nunderstands all of the bricks. Instead, we have a system of debate, reviews, scrutiny that only allows the most accurate information\nto be added to the tower. And honestly, I don't think\nhumans are well suited to adapt to this very impersonal way of understanding the world. We have evolved over millions of years with our senses as our\nmain driver of survival. And now, we live in a society\nthat is run by big systems and impersonal institutions\nthat we will never touch and feel, much less understand. And that's why we have people\nwho believe the world is flat, despite conclusive\nevidence to the contrary. This belief is a proxy\nfor a much larger paradigm that mistrusts anything that\nyou can't touch and feel. And so, yeah, I'm really\nsad that only 84% of people can say with certainty that\nthey've always believed that the world is a globe. And that's 64% for younger\npeople, only 64% of people. Like that, that just blows my mind! And, it's incredibly sad! But, despite this belief, this movement, these conventions, this total lunacy, science will continue to do its thing. It will continue to go\nout, observe the world with these amazing tools that we have, come back, debate it, and add\nto this tower of knowledge that helps us see the\nworld as it really is.

    "title": "Why Forests Burn",
    "video_id": "L8KOL8X5X5c",
    "captions": "I am in a weird hotel room there's a bathtub in the hotel room this is the Columbia Gorge it is a big beautiful river that divides the state of Washington from the state of Oregon a couple years ago this Columbia Gorge looked like this some kid threw a firework into a bunch of brush and it lit the entire forest on fire 50,000 acres were burned a bunch of people lost their houses as we're talking about this luscious pristine green Gorge now turning orange and red I grew up in Oregon and this Gorge has always been like the most beautiful place to go on hikes and stuff so when I saw the news that this was burning when I saw this imagery I was bummed and like look at this amazing place and it's completely destroyed by fire turns out that's wrong that whole idea that like this fire is destroying this forest is totally wrong and I recently learned that it recently delved into wildfires and discovered an entirely different narrative about wildfires and I want to share that with you I want to do this as quickly as it possibly can so I'm gonna force myself to make this the most concise and straight to the point explainer I've ever made I'm gonna give myself seven minutes to explain this to you can I do an adequate explanation in just a few minutes I think let's find out okay so first things first what we're talking about here is not necessarily all the forest fires or wildfires in the world but not going about like the Amazon which is being burned for deforestation for industry we're talking about the wildfires in the western United States which if you live in the United States you've probably seen this somewhere on the news it's hard to wrap your head around this tonight in the West wicked wildfires burning their way into the record books to a record-setting monster now the largest wildfire in state history the news likes to think of these wildfires as a record-breaking or unprecedented that word or record-breaking or unprecedented is actually totally wrong it's important to note that wildfires used to burn way more land than they do now okay so this idea that wildfires are somehow unprecedented or record-breaking is just wrong factually and here's why it turns out wildfires are completely natural sorry let me go a bit further here wildfires are completely natural and actually very ecologically beneficial for a forest ecosystem how am i doing on time okay so next look at this beautiful drone image look at this forest the force of Oregon are beautiful they blanket entire swaths of land as far as the eye can see a forest like this is like a city it has shrubs and wildflowers and owls and mushrooms and woodpeckers and random birds that you've never heard of and all of these different inhabitants of the city do different jobs have different functions they're good at different things of different specializations and they all get paid differently in the sense of sunlight or nutrients they're all kind of competing with each other but at the same time they're kind of working together in a symbiotic relationship much like a city everyone there is competing in some ways but they're also working together the forest is kind of similar now look at these trees these big beautiful evergreen conifer trees after a while of a forest development these trees start to get really tall and they start to hog all of the sunlight they start to cast a shadow over the entire forest floor which for me is just really pretty like hiking through that it's like really nice but for the economy of the forest this is actually not a very good thing it's kind of like if in a city you just had a few bigwigs who made all the money had all the wealth can kind of control all the land and in those cases everyone suffers so you're looking at this beautiful blanket of trees over the mountains and you're like this is beautiful this actually isn't the optimal situation for a forest this is where fire fire comes in and it resets some of this it thins out some of the shadow causing trees it'll burn down some trees it will leave other trees kind of untouched it will burn down kind of all of the underbrush and the understory of the forest floor let me explain why business is such a good thing I actually went back into the gorge after this burn just a few weeks ago [Music] as I was walking through this forest I was surprised that like not everything was burned some of these trees just had a little blackening on their face so something was really burned up but other stuff was just fine what happens after a forest burns is that it begins to regrow but it begins to regrow very differently than it was before look at this tree this is called a snag this is a tree that was completely burned down the first thing that happens is that around the base of this tree you're gonna have a bunch of new wildflowers and fungi and plants that couldn't grow there before because there wasn't sunlight because it was in shadow now they can grow in the tree itself you're gonna have a lot of insects and bugs that now can live inside of the cavity of this tree because it's dead it's now becoming more Hollow then let's say a woodpecker swoops and starts to eat those bugs and in the process of pecking on this dead tree the snag they hollow out a big hole in this tree then a mammal maybe can come into this ecosystem and find the hollow in this tree made by the woodpecker a great habitat a great home where they can live suddenly this snag this totally burned down tree is actually now an amazing neighborhood in the forest city the neighborhood has affordable housing it has amazing new restaurants and it has a diversity of different inhabitants that all come together and share their different specializations and their benefits for the benefit of all the reason why this is such a good thing is because the currency of a forest is diversity biodiversity an ecosystem that has lots of different plants and animals that all do different things is a more resilient more thriving ecosystem I mean my intuition would have said that the healthiest forests in the world look like this but it turns out the healthiest force in the world look like this forest experts will call this kind of patchy er look a mosaic it's then the poorest now above abandons green in a mosaic it is a patchwork of different Ecology's different ecosystems different habitats that are all tied together that are all close together and they create a much more robust ecosystem and so it turns out that fire is actually the factor that causes these more mosaic type forests these more bio diverse thriving forest systems okay I don't have very much time left but let me just finish this up by saying I'm sitting here talking about all the benefits of a wildfire but clearly wildfires can be a disaster [Music] they're just not a disaster for the forest they're a disaster for humans it's important to note this because wildfires have become a disaster become this unprecedented problem because humans are often affected so fires are increasing they're becoming exacerbated by a warming planet that is a fact both human caused and naturally caused fires are doing more damage to humans than ever but just to remember next time you see this news of a fire sweeping across some place that is destroying so much that fires are a catastrophe for humans but not necessarily catastrophe for mother nature or for forests and in fact they're actually a major benefit I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video funeral Skillshare is it is an online repository of thousands of tutorials video based tutorials where you can learn tons of different things from entrepreneurship to film to photography to design really it's all there on Skillshare there's one course in particular that's taught by Jake Bartlett called the beginner's guide to After Effects which is a really good overview of a bunch of different really important aspects of this software that I used to do all my animation having a foundational education in After Effects can unlock so many features that are just kind of hidden and not really intuitive defined Skillshare is a subscription-based thing so you can go on subscribe and get unlimited access to all of these tutorials and kind of learn whatever you want at your own pace it's pretty darn cheap it's like under 10 bucks a month if you do the annual subscription but because they're sponsoring this video they're giving you two months free if you're interested you can go to the link in my description Center for skill share and start learning stuff for two months for free you can see if it's a good fit and then after that it's literally under ten dollars I pay more than that for like a sandwich these days in the city kind of a shame but seriously I'm a huge fan of online learning that's how I learned all of my video and animation skills is on the internet not through a school and so I believe in Skillshare and what they're doing and believe that you can really learn a lot of stuff with the internet so go to link in the description try it out for a couple of months see how it fits and thank you Skillshare for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching I'm gonna go take a bath I think I'm still undecided it's kind of a weird thing to take a bath in a room but it's also kind of cool I don't know I'll tell you later how it went okay see ya [Music]"

    "title": "The Biggest Project of my Life",
    "video_id": "8njOx9sFBQc",
    "captions": "I'm working on the biggest project of my entire life look at this picture this is me when I left the United States for the first time yeah I know it's super low res digital cameras were awkwardly bad in 2005 this first trip abroad for me was to Mexico I was 17 years old and I was really into parkour for some reason a year later I saved up all I could and I left again on another choice Paris London Wales on this trip while I was atop a castle ruin in Wales is actually at this very moment right here making this awkward teenager face something clicked in my brain hold on this is a my journal from 2007 [Music] everything is so different my eyes feel open really man that's like very cliche world and then I ended up drawing what looks like a poorly drawn caveman painting that represents what I was feeling I wasn't sure who I was or what I believed or what I was gonna be doing in five years or what I wanted to be when I grew up but in that moment this moment here making this awkward grin on the top of a castle ruined in Wales by myself I felt sure of one thing which you can see in my little drawing I was positive that my future would include me getting on airplanes and exploring this planet and that's what happened [Music] I got married and suddenly I had a travel companion and then I had kids and suddenly I had two or three travel companions okay so why am I telling you all of this the stories and kind of this background well because it has a lot to do with what I do today and my career and this big giant thing I want to tell you about I've made a career out of going to places and trying to understand them and trying to communicate that story of that place to a lot of people and one of my major goals is to help people feel empowered to travel for themselves and to go to a place and feel more informed and more connected with the place so today I'm announcing that we are launching a company it's the biggest thing I've ever done and it's called bright trips [Music] right trip is a platform a video based platform where you can take travel courses don't know what a travel course is that's because they didn't exist and then we invented them and now they do think of bright trip courses as like explainer videos with animation and tons of video and explanation but that are geared towards helping you prepare for your next trip so if you're going to say Tokyo you might enroll in a course that teaches you about ramen its history what makes a good bowl of ramen and how to actually eat ramen when you're in Tokyo that's a real example there's actually a course on that in a bright trip course you get a healthy dose of history and context surrounding a place but then you also get practical tips on how to take on a city or how to roadtrip through a certain place or how to order high-end sushi these are all examples from one of our pilot courses about Tokyo which is hours of content that we have poured our efforts into to make it the most enlightening and empowering course possible the goal of every course is to give you a rich visual learning experience so that these concepts about a place will really sink in and we use a lot of beautiful footage but we also use animation to do this bright trip courses aren't just about places like Tokyo they're also about concepts and techniques like how to travel with kids or how to document your trip this is all video based learning that you can take at your own pace whenever you want after you buy the course with every course you also get a PDF guide that's kind of like a summary or a cheat sheet of what we cover in the course and for location courses you also get a map that tells you everywhere we went so that you can follow along and choose to replicate our itinerary if you want to but these courses are not to tell you to do a certain itinerary to go to a certain place it's to empower you with knowledge about a place so that when you get there you can spend time experiencing it and not just learning how to get around we're also developing a course series about advanced travel filmmaking the professional thing that we do for our careers going around and telling stories in different countries we've started with camera fundamentals which is how to understand a camera which you can check out in the catalog but eventually this will be several courses that to every aspect of travel filmmaking we basically take everything we know about this industry and about this career and try to put it into these courses [Music] [Applause] so this launches today it's launched it's live bride trip calm go check out the catalogue and see if any of these courses are helpful to you as you think about your next trip and these are just our first courses it's a lot of content but we want this to be a big catalog full of tons of different courses I've always operated with feedback from you all and that has informed my work forever and this is no different so tell me what kind of course you want maybe it's a place maybe it's a technique what kind of course do you want in travel so that's it I'm kind of nervous this is kind of the biggest thing I've ever done in terms of launching something huge nan I'm about to actually get on a flight to Portland to go see my family so I hope you like right trip [Music] [Applause]"

    "title": "My Recipe for Escape | Italy & Switzerland",
    "video_id": "N8IlEHb5coo",
    "captions": "do you see this mountain range and this mountain village here's a train weaving through these mountains and this village here's a lake at the foot of these mountains boats ferries fog tunnels I want to tell you a story of an adventure I took to a very special place a border region in Europe it's right here here's this region from another angle this is looking south you can see that this is where Italy ends and Switzerland begins this is the magical place and talking about I want to tell you about this because this trip perfectly encapsulates what I think as my recipe for escape I use the word escape because it kind of feels like I'm running running away from something running away from some incessant pull to do things some pressure that tells me to work and produce and do more it's this constant call to perform for society I kind of love it in fact this isn't a bad thing this pressure this intensity it keeps us all working but the only way that I can really keep going keep grinding is if I can escape to pull away and to run away from everything just for a while so let me tell you my ingredients for a real escape number one and the most important foundational ingredient is mountains the best escapes happen in the mountains he doesn't have to be the mountains of northern Italy or Switzerland any mountain range will do I have found escape in mountains from Oregon to Utah to Spain to Guatemala even the little mountains near where I live on the east coast of the United States Mountains are a perfect place to escape [Music] the mountains are like a filter a border if you will they block out busyness there's nothing busy happening in the mountains everything looks like this [Music] it's quiet there's always following water there's always mist there's fog and there are always ecosystems that manifest themselves in extremes extremely sharp Peaks giving way to extremely steep slopes extremely blue water extremely yellow trees we explored lots of mountains the second ingredient happens atop the mountain it's the mountain village like this one where the people have been quietly living their lives for ages there's no hustle up here there's no grind there's no one trying to climb any ladder it is so quiet I haven't heard this sort of silence for like a year or more it's so there's no one doing what I've been doing for the past seven years which is hustling and grinding to make something big in some big system no one is doing that here they're just doing this we hit a lot of these little villages on this trip just a few kilometers over the Swiss border you can see this one it's called so glial and it was one of my favorite places of the trip if not this entire year we spent the day running down these trails convincing our children that these rocks are actually a playground and finishing the day with a dinner that looked over these mountains the town was silent empty we were eating Italian food but we were in Switzerland it was perfect ingredient number three is unplanned adventure my life is really tightly planned I have two children and I work like three jobs every day I make lists of exactly what I can get done in eight and a half hours and then I work focusing on each of these items down to the minute so for me escape looks like this see that little tiny church all the way up there it's right there yep we're gonna turn and we're gonna hike and we're gonna discover a way to get up to that mountain do you think we can make it happen or no so yeah you can point it a church on a mountain and just decide that you want to hike to it maybe you'll make it maybe you won't I can tell we're in the right place because if I look up through the crack up there we're getting closer and closer these unplanned adventures are for some reason incredibly restorative and satisfying for me we made it up to this level church that I later learned was called San Martino I had no idea of the kids would be able to make it up the side of the mountain but they did it and they did a great job which made it even more exciting for some reason the spontaneity and unplanned nature of this adventure made it all the more exciting and all the more restorative for my brain [Music] ingredient number four lakes and fairies when I was dating is and I looked like this I would go up to visit her in Washington Washington State she lived across the water from Seattle so I'd go across these ferries a lot I learned to really love ferries giant boats that are often a major mode of transportation for the locals they're cheap they're frequent and they're totally local no frills just a bunch of people trying to get around the place they live in the ferries in Lake Como bounce around to different villages you can even take your car on to these ferries which for some reason feels kind of awesome you can also get around on another kind of boat [Music] having a boat to yourself also touches on the previous ingredient of unplanned adventure feels like the epitome of escape you're cruising around a lake wherever you want you find a village that looks cool and you end up parking in the public dock and running around [Music] until we decide to jump back on the boat and do it again this was our chosen splurge for the trip and it was well worth it my favorite part about how we got this boat is you just find a local guy at a dock and ask if he can rent his boat and he tells you yes and before you know it you're cruising the last ingredient is one that I have a hard time quantifying I don't know what to call it or how to even think about it but I'm going to call it moving through mountains in any way any fashion any mode of transportation with your legs with a train with a car just moving through big mountains watching Peaks and mountain rivers move by you as you traverse the large daunting mountains mountain roads always look like they were designed to be art but somehow they're incredibly functional to get you up the steep grade and across the mountain pass [Music] first we drove through these mountains the boys listening to an audio book about a frog in a toad and is and I having long conversations about big things and little things connecting and dreaming about the future moving through these mountains does something to my brain and I can't really describe it but it's good it's really good just over the border from Italy into Switzerland you can get on a train that takes you over the Swiss Alps when you're on a train like this surrounded by large mountains and moving through them for me my mind is forced to be right here I'd successfully escaped any pressure any of that pulling stress that makes you think about the thing you have to do it was all gone we got off in a little town called post gavel which had a river with water that was so blue it seemed unfair we found a little town square and wandered the town before getting back on the train and making the journey back and let me remind you that it doesn't have to be these quaint beautiful world-renowned Alps moving through any mountain range in a train or in a car or hiking has the same effect for me it's that mountain effect the mountains somehow always filter the world away from me now I love cities and beaches but when my chest is tight and my brain is buzzing with stress I know it's time for an escape so this is my recipe for escape Mountain Village unplanned adventures waters and boats and moving through mountains it's like medicine for me it cures an overworked brain and helps me truly restore myself and reinvigorate the relationships with my family a very big thank you to peak design for sponsoring this video peak design makes a bag that I have been using for years ever since I started really doing travel filmmaking and traveling a lot it's a very smart camera bag as well as a bag that I use for a lot of other things that have nothing to do with cameras they just launched the version 2 of their everyday bag which is the bag I've been using for years and they sent me one it's still got a lot of the smart design stuff from the original but it's got some upgrades that are pretty cool and I've been having a really fun time playing around with weatherproof coating it's got some other kind of subtle design tweaks in terms of the cuts and the where the zipper is and exactly where the pockets are it's got magnets in the backs of the straps and so the straps kind of lay like perfectly flat against the back it's little smart features like that that really keep me coming back to peak design they designed a tripod earlier this year that has become my new travel tripod I use it for every project and with this new bag they increased the size of the water bottle container so now you can slip the tripod into it and it won't like swing out for loic's your support I use this little key fob and wrap it around the tripod and connect it to a little Universal peak connector right there so this is the new peak design everyday bag this is the 30 liter and it's just a comfortable smart bag that's very durable so thanks peak design as a part of this new launch they also have a smaller version which is this zip design which is a little bit different and I've been using that as I've been traversing around it through my drone in here and then of course their sling which is if I'm just using the drone and going out and kind of exploring with the drone and maybe like one lens or something that I can throw in here this thing is fantastic it's super small and easy and it's just a sling that goes around I have been using this stuff long before they ever sponsored by videos and can say they're great so check out the link in my description and you can go over to peak design check out these bags and hopefully you like them as much as I do thank you peak design for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching this piece on my trip to Italy and Switzerland it was really kind of my way of articulating this feeling of escape that I could have yearned for after long periods of work and I hope you enjoyed it I'll see you next time"

    "video_id": "g52A2CPEi4A",
    "captions": "(clicking and rattling) - Here it is. Here's the original one. I think there's this misnomer\nthat my orange coat is dead, but no, it's just dying quickly. There's just a good\namount of this going on. But I think this thing has a\ncouple more years, for sure. (dramatic music) So this is my desk. I sit here all day and I\nwork and I look at this map. Whenever I'm daydreaming,\nI just look at this map. (dramatic music) I bought this map off eBay and it was in like an elementary school, and now it's in my office. I notice something every time I look at it that kind of irks me. That something is this, this zero. This zero, which is not just one number, but it's actually a corresponding\nline that looks like this. (rumbling) Let's back up here for a second. The earth is divided into lines. (upbeat music) Sometimes they're curved\nlike they are on my map, and whether or not\nthey're curved or straight has to do with this concept of projection, which I'm not going to talk about here. I've talked about plenty\nusing a knife and a globe back in an old Vox video that I made. But just know that the earth\nis divided up into lines, latitude and longitude lines. Ones that go up and down and\nones that go from side to side. All of these lines in the grid have a number associated with them. So for the up and down\nlines, there's a zero point. And then anywhere to the\nright of that or east of that starts to go up from zero to 180, with a little E next to it\nfor east of the zero line, and then everything to\nthe left or the west of it has the same thing, zero\nto 180 with a W for west. Okay, that center point is the zero point from which all east and\nwest things are measured. The same thing for these\nside to side lines. If you go up from here, you're gonna start to\nget higher and higher until you get to 180 degrees north. Or if you go south, you\nwill go 180 degrees south, which is the south pole. Finding out where the zero point should be for these horizontal lines\nis actually quite easy. The earth has these two natural poles, which make for a natural\ntop and bottom of the earth, and halfway in between those two poles, you have this perfect\ncenter point, the equator, which is a very natural\nplace to put this zero point and to measure everything from. The up and down lines\nare totally arbitrary, where you decide them, like,\nwho's the say that, like, it couldn't be right here in\nRussia, and this could be zero, and everything could go\nwest and east from here, or Japan for that matter? Well, in fact, a long time\nago, that's how it used to be. These maps with these grids\nwere really, really important for navigating the world. And so everyone had to\nchoose a zero point. And most would just make their capital or their home base the zero point. If you lived in Japan, you would just make Japan the zero point and the rest of the\ncoordinates would be measured against that one zero\npoint, which was Japan. And same if you lived in\nFrance or Washington, D.C. This was fine because back\nthen countries kind of just fought wars and competed with each other. They weren't really\ncollaborating or aligning or trading as much as they do today. And so everyone could\njust have their own maps centered around their place\nand they did just fine. But then around the 1800s, a\nfew things started to happen that completely changed everything. (dramatic music) First, countries and empires, instead of just competing\nand fighting with each other started to actually say like, we should align with each\nother and trade and be friends because that's better for everyone. Pair this with the fact that\nmap making and sea navigation was becoming like a big industry. It was no longer just\nthe king ordering maps to be made for their like expeditions. But now it was like private businesses going out and doing things\nthat private businesses do. (screeching) And so there was now like a\ndemand for good seafaring maps. In short, map making was trending. Seems like a pretty good time to be alive. Okay, and there was one more thing that was happening around this time that was super important, which is, this: (upbeat music) Trains, trains everywhere. Trains will just like\npopping up everywhere. And trains were also trending. People were now able to travel\nlike across the country, not just like on their horses, but on this whole system of trains where you could buy a\nticket, get on a train, and end up somewhere\nhundreds of miles away. And you know, what trains run on, besides coal, is time,\ntimetables, schedules. How do you know when your\ntrain is going to arrive and when it's gonna leave and\nwhen it's gonna get there? Time, some universal set time. The problem is, back in the 1800s, there was no universal set time. Check out this piece of paper. Today, all of these\ncities and towns would be just on Eastern Standard\nTime, one time zone. But back then, every\ntown had their own time, depending on when it was noon for them. If they were a little bit east\nor a little bit west of here, that would be different\nthan in Washington, D.C. Total nightmare for trains. The lifeblood of trains is time. And this time mish-mash\njust wasn't gonna work. Okay, so what does all of\nthis have to do with this? Look at this guy. (dramatic music) You probably don't know\nwho this person is. I didn't know who this person was. He was the US president\nthat no one remembers. This US president in the late 1800s saw a problem with all of this. He realized that having\na bunch of different maps with a bunch of different zero points based on whoever was\nmaking it was a problem. And he realized that not\nhaving a universal time zone or some sort of universal way of making the same time for\neveryone was also a problem. So he invited 41 countries to\ncome here to Washington D.C., where I live, and to sit around and think and talk about where this\nzero point should be. Where should the center of the world be so that we can measure\ntime as well as navigation. All maps could be\nnormalized to this one spot. So after a moment of\na bunch of white dudes sitting around in a room\nin Washington, D.C., which is kind of what's happening\ntoday in Washington, D.C., they came to a vote. And that vote almost unanimously said that the zero line should be right here. (dramatic music) This line, if you zoom in, goes right through London, England. It actually goes through\na little outskirts town called Greenwich. Greenwich is the home\nof the Royal Observatory of the British Empire. This would be the place\nwhere the Prime Meridian, or the zero point for the entire world, east and west, would start. Every country at the conference agreed that this should be the case, except for the Dominican Republic, at that time called Santo Domingo. They said, no, they were the one country that didn't like this proposal. And France and Brazil actually\nabstained diplomatically, which was kind of them saying like, \"Oh, we don't agree with this.\" France continued to make their maps with Paris as the center point, but eventually they got on board as well. So that gets to the\ncrux of my big question of why the zero right there, which is a bunch of people voted on it. But why were they so down with\nBritain having the zero point being the center of the world? Well, the answer is because it was 1884 and Britain was just\nreally good at the ocean. The British Empire was by far the biggest, most powerful navy that\nhad the most experience with maps and ocean-faring. And so it was kind of a\nnatural choice to let Britain, the king of the ocean,\nhave this center point. And from then on, maps started\nto be drafted with Greenwich, this Royal Observatory,\nas the center point for the east/west divide in the world. Over time, this exact point,\nexactly where it's drawn, has shifted a tiny bit\nbecause of better tools to measure things. And so it's actually like not literally on the Royal Observatory anymore, but it's effectively in the same place that was drawn in this 1884 conference. But they also established that\nall time in the entire world would be measured against\nthis same spot, Greenwich. Noon at Greenwich, at\nthe Royal Observatory, would be the peg against\nwhich all other time was set. They called this Greenwich Mean Time. So you end up getting a\nmap that looks like this. (dramatic music) Zoom in and you see\nGreenwich is right here. That's GMT, Greenwich Mean Time, okay? You go west of here and you\nstart to get GMT minus one or minus two, minus three. You can come all the way back to the east coast of the United States. And this time zone is Greenwich meantime, minus five right now,\nsometimes it's minus four, if there's daylight savings, and daylight savings is dumb and whatever, but you get the idea. The more you go west, you go\nback from Greenwich Mean Time. If you go east, it's the opposite. You go forward of Greenwich Mean Time. So if it's noon at Greenwich,\nthen this next time zone, it would be 1:00 pm, 2:00 pm,\n3:00 pm, 4:00 pm, et cetera. So these time zones have been marked up in these kind of strange shapes. Eventually, if you go 12\nsteps away from Greenwich, 12 time zones, you'll end\nup here, at this mess. This mess is the International Date Line. This is where Greenwich Mean Time, plus 12 or minus 12 ends up at this line, which is where a new day starts. So let me give you an example\nof what this would look like. Imagine it's 4:00 pm\nin Greenwich, England, right here at this Royal Observatory. It is 4:00 pm GMT on May 28th. If anyone wants to send\nme a birthday gift, May 28th, May 28th. It's May 28th at 4:00 pm\nGMT, Greenwich, Mean Time. Sitting, chilling in\nthe Royal Observatory, which I've never actually been to. I need to go to the Royal Observatory. I need to go to the Royal Observatory. I'm going to do that this\nyear, next year, at some point. Okay. So it's 4:00 pm, May 28th. Across the ocean here in\nWashington, D.C., at that time, you can see that we go from\n4:00 pm minus five, so 11:00 am. Okay, so it's 11:00 am\nhere in Washington, D.C. at that exact time on May 28th. Head across the United States to the west coast of the United States, to Seattle or Portland, and right there, it's three hours earlier than it is here. And you're now at 8:00\nam. So it's 8:00 am here. It's still 4:00 pm in Greenwich. It's still 4:00 pm in London. Now you head into the Pacific Ocean. Keep going west until you\nget to French Polynesia, at which time it's five in the morning. You're now at GMT minus 11.\nIt's five in the morning. And then you get right\nup to this messy line. If you were to be in the Baker Islands, which is like a US, like\nrandom uninhabited island in the middle of the Pacific\nOcean, you would be at 4:00 am. So it's 4:00 pm over in Greenwich. It's 4:00 am on this random\nisland in the Pacific. So then cross this messy looking line. It's still 4:00 am, but\nnow it's the next day. It's May 29th at 4:00 am. Here in Fiji at the same\ntime, 4:00 pm at Greenwich, it's now 4:00 am the next day, May 29th. So we went from being 12\nhours behind Greenwich to being 12 hours in front of Greenwich, just by going over this\nInternational Date Line. You could do this exact same\nthing going the other way. Start heading east, and\nyou see that, you know, it's 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm. Head all the way over into Asia, and now you're getting closer to seeing how that 4:00 am happens\nwhen you get over to Fiji. Now, the caveat to all\nof this is, of course, is that some of these\ncountries switch by an hour for like daylight savings\ntype things and whatever, but ignore that. Imagine there wasn't daylight savings. Right now, in this moment,\nwhere daylight savings is, at least in the United States, this holds across the whole world. Someday I'll make a video\nabout this whole messy debacle. But the point of all of this is to say that because of this conference in 1884 to reconcile train timetables\nand to make maps more uniform, we now have this\nnavigation and time system that rules our whole world. And Britain is just sitting at\nthe center of it, of course. The British Empire may have fallen and the world has moved on from Britain being the center\nof the world in a lot of ways, but it's still technically\nthe center of the world in a lot of ways, I'm gonna put some\nlinks in the description for some of these cool tools that kind of help visualize time zones, if you're interested\nin that sort of thing. But yeah, my question has been answered. I actually didn't know the\nanswer to this question. And I went on a deep dive and now I know. So now I'll sit at my desk\nand I will know the answer to why the zero, and I\nthink that was worth it. So thanks. Big thank you to Skillshare\nfor sponsoring this video. Skillshare is this giant\nrepository of online tutorials where you can subscribe\nand have unlimited access to tutorials about\neverything you can imagine from design to entrepreneurial skills, to photography,\nvideography, it's all there. I learned everything I\nknow with online tools, including Skillshare, and I really believe in the\nmodel of online learning. There's one course in particular\nthat I would recommend, which is this Premiere starting course. I remember the year I\nswitched over to Premiere from Final Cut Pro to edit my videos. I knew a lot about the\nfundamentals of editing, but I found that going through a course that really lays out all\nof the features of Premiere and refreshes all of the kind\nof fundamentals of editing was really important. So even if you are like an\neditor who's experienced, I think there's great\nvalue in going through and getting a holistic\nview of what Premier can do and some of the tricks and tips\nthat maybe you didn't learn if you haven't done any\nsort of formal trainings. Because they sponsored this video, they're giving all of you two months free of unlimited access to\nall of these tutorials. So you can try it out, see\nif it's a good for you. So click the link in the description to get those two months free, test it out, see if you like it. Thank you, Skillshare, for sponsoring and thank you all for watching. I will see you in another\nvideo sometime in the future. (upbeat music)"

    "video_id": "fqB5W-AdFqw",
    "captions": "I get asked this one question a bunch which is what inspires you to create stuff notice this has been a weird and hard question for me to answer because I don't really know what people mean by inspire is inspiration this mystical magical force in the universe that hits you and provokes you to want to make something new I don't really know what inspiration means for most people which is why I don't ever really answer this question head-on but in the name of trying to answer this question I've been thinking a lot about it let me start off by telling you what I think inspiration doesn't mean I don't think inspiration is that burst of enthusiasm for something or that fleeting feeling of excitement when you hear a motivational speech or you read a self-help book in the course of a 10 minute video or a short book you can feel those feelings of excitement and motivation but I don't really see that as inspiration inspiration is kind of the opposite in the sense that it is quieter it's not a burst of excitement or enthusiasm for me it's a quieter thing that you have to wrestle with and you have to discern it and you have to act on it the best kind of inspiration lets me see the thing that I want to make it doesn't tell me how to make it but it allows me to see something that doesn't exist and then start the long process of building it so by this definition of inspiration which is my own version probably different than yours but by this definition I can actually answer this question of what inspires me I can think of one thing that fuels this desire to visualize something that doesn't exist and then plot the course to make it a reality and that thing that inspires me is music [Music] okay wait hold on a second if if you think that I'm going to spend the rest of this video just talking in kind of fluffy vague language about what inspires me that's not the case for the rest of the video I want to actually give you some concrete helpful tips on how inspiration works for me and particularly how I use music to help frame out and tell stories I'm not innocent when it comes to fluffy motivational stuff but this video will not be that from now on so with that let's get back to it I'm going to play an a-flat major seven which is one of my favorite chords and I'll tell you a quick story in 2013 is and I had just bought our first like semi-professional camera and I went on a trip to Peru I was just getting into like filming travels and editing it together so that's what I did when I was in Peru with my new nice camera while I was driving up into the mountains my Pandora radio playlist served me up this song [Laughter] [Music] this immediately sparked something for me this song while I was driving really made me feel things and it's the first time that I can remember feeling inspired to make something based on a piece of music so I went back and I made this video that included a whole scene of me driving through the mountains with this music this song is frankly like too dramatic it's like a little bit too emotional for what I was doing which is just like traveling by myself in Peru it doesn't really match the tone of the little story I'm telling here the song really should be more something like this [Music] I'm gonna talk more about tone matching and how I think about that when it comes to using music to tell stories but for now let's use this little Peru example to talk about my first not fluffy concrete tip when it comes to inspiration and music I was a kid learning to tell stories but while this song wasn't maybe the best choice to set the tone and maybe it wasn't the most appropriate the thing that was good about this experience is that I at least felt inspiration and then I acted on it I think it's really easy to feel inspired by something and feel a desire to make something like that or to integrate a song or something into your video and then immediately put up blockades to that by saying oh this probably is good enough oh I probably shouldn't do this because it's not cool enough that's the best way to squash inspiration my suggestion my tip here is that if you feel any sort of inspiration you feel a desire to make something based on something you've seen or heard follow it nurture it try to see it through this was the first time I ever acted on it and yeah it wasn't perfect or great or whatever but it was the beginning of a long journey a vacuum an inspiration that would eventually become better and better with time [Music] okay so now for tip number two to me music is like a superpower you have this ability to make your viewer feel or think in a certain way for just a minute in the name of telling a story or communicating an idea that's really powerful perhaps the biggest mistake and sometimes the most egregious offence when it comes to using music and telling stories is exactly what you saw with my Peru video abusing this music that is meant to kind of pull the heartstrings and make you feel something when the story or the scene in the video really doesn't deserve it to me cheapens your video and it takes away your ability to use that heart stirring tugging emotional music in a place that actually deserves it to actually create an emotional investment using music I call this tone matching or earning the feelings of your viewer don't unfairly use emotional music when the story doesn't warrant it it's cheap it's trashy I've done it a million times it's not a good look okay so this third tip is gonna really help with what I just talked about with tone matching and earning feelings and stuff like that in my mind I see almost all music as falling into two big buckets there is feeling music which is what we just talked about feeling emotional it pulls at your heartstrings feeling music and then on the other side there is thinking music which is a very different vibe of music this allows the viewer to be more focused on what you're saying and to engage more of their brain instead of like they're feeling parts if you're sharing information or you're sharing context or stuff that isn't really kind of emotional or personal this is the type of music that you want to use okay I'm talking a lot of abstract terms thinking feeling I want to dive in and show you what this actually looks like when I'm looking for music I actually reached out to music bed when I was writing this video and told them that I was making a video about music and inspiration and that I was going to be doing a demo on their site ask them if they wanted to sponsor it and they said yes so music read sponsors this video I in by no means making this video because of music bed I would have made it anyway but thank you music vet for sponsoring this video I will talk about that later at the end of the video for now I want to show you this demo using music bed and feel like I had to tell you that music that sponsored this video you can see that just in the genres tab here there are way more genres and types of music than just thinking and feeling I want to be clear that I'm not saying that those are the only two types of music that I use in my videos I'm saying that all of this music usually falls within one or the other of those buckets so let's talk feeling first I often find that if I hit things like ambient I'm gonna get a lot of feeling music if you use this at the beginning of your video and you're not talking about like an emotional thing you're off base you should use this music once you've earned some sort of emotional investment or if you're talking about something that's emotional and personal and that warrants this really beautiful sense of feeling [Music] okay so ambient you'll often find some feeling pieces in the ambient category cinematic is another one we often find more somber contemplative feeling type music you're not gonna be doing an explainer over this this is uplifting this is emotional this is the climax of a big journey that is now happening or a beautiful thing like a wedding uplifting acoustic like obviously that's gonna be feeling music uplifting it's an emotional word [Music] coming home after five years away we're feeling something you're gonna use this earn it okay so what about for thinking pieces I've talked a lot about like emotional feeling pieces I think you know it when you hear it now but what about thinking pieces what does that sound like abstract beats let's see what abstract beats anything with beats is often thinking there's not going to be deep emotional stuff when the focus of the music is as a beach sometimes there is but often that's a great signal that we're talking about more of a thinking piece yeah this is a high energy thinking piece this is like I'm moving along we're going on an adventure we're talking about stuff this is cooler it's less emotional it's a little bit more emotionally neutral this is sweet yep I'm definitely downloading this one for future use thank you let's see what's in travel thinking piece the other thing you can do instead of just looking at playlists is you can really hone in by deciding exactly what kind of attributes or adjectives you want to use so there's on Rah's you could say I'm looking for like electronic music and the mood I want it to be chill and I want it to be happy okay let's say I'm looking for a thinking piece maybe chill and happy might give me a think e-type piece you may give me a little to feeling with that happy in there we'll see I've used this one for explainer II yeah great thinking piece just not not too emotional my pulling anyone's heartstrings too much with this yeah this is a good one electric chill happy good okay let's do one more let's try to get let's say okay I've got a video I have created this big emotional arc and I want there to be a climax where at the end of this long journey I finally make it to this destination that I have hyped the viewer up in the course of my story let's find a feeling piece that will now fit within that because you've earned the right to now use this emotional music to communicate exactly what you're feeling so I want to just stay in mood and say uplifting peaceful love contemplative maybe yeah this is like really feeling stuff beautiful drone shot on sunrises we're finally making it to the final peak here comes a swell you can see it in the waveforms what its gonna be triumphant yeah it resolves a little bit yeah I like this you get the point you thinking versus feeling I want to make it clear not every song is like one or the other it's often some spectrum but when I'm thinking of music I'm often thinking of does it fall more into one or the other category and what is the tone and trying to set am I just talking about information and kind of showing us getting from one place to the other that's more of a thinking these am I talking about personal things or having an emotional kind of climax that's happening in the middle of the story that's gonna be more of a feeling the fourth concrete tip and the thing that maybe is now the most important tip if you're following along with these different concepts of thinking and feeling and telling matching and stuff like that when I am telling a story that has kind of an ebb and flow at ten minute video or you know on Porter's episode or a vlog or whatever it is I want to make sure that my story goes back and forth between thinking scenes and feeling scenes so I don't know look at the most recent video I did on Amsterdam okay so I start off with this thinking piece information over here celo thinking piece look at this oh and you see that so this this is more of just a storytelling principle generally on how I structure my stories I want there to be a piece where there's a lot of information and just as the viewers brain is getting tired of like tons of explainer information use choice tears and you change the tone to something more emotional or feeling based how do I do that I'm in this explainer part where I'm explaining this section about how they took this they built a wall and they built all these islands on the wall and this and that and then let's take a breather and feel for a little bit kind of just like absorb this big thing if you watch one of my videos you will notice that I go back and forth between thinking and feeling it's not like one for one for one for one it's not like some mathematical formula I try to make it a journey back and forth between the more cerebral thinking pieces and the more emotional personal pieces they don't have to always be like sappy emotional but are just a little bit less cerebral and a little bit more sensory or feelings based so I really hope it made sense and I hope you can apply some of these principles to whatever you're doing if you've stuck around this long into the video you clearly are interested in some aspect of this so I'm curious to hear what clicked with you and what didn't as I said earlier this video is sponsored by music bed loop music bed into this idea because it seemed like a good fit and because of that they want to give all of you who are watching this a 30-day trial to have unlimited access to their giant library of wonderful music as you saw you can use these playlists and these attributes to really sort through and find the music that you're looking for to tell your story cool thing about music bed is that it's not royalty free meaning if you use an artist music they will get paid which is kind of cool but for you as the Creator you can just download unlimited songs for the monthly subscription and use them and monetize them even and get paid yourself if you're a YouTube creator or if you're just making videos for fun it's also just a really cheap way to get good music so there's a link in the description that you can click on and get a month for free and test it out and see if it works if you like it see if you're into it thank you music but for sponsoring this video and thank you for watching I will see you next time [Music]"

    "video_id": "aq1dsm5OzzI",
    "captions": "20:19 has been quite the year so we're working on a lot of stuff right now a lot of head down out of computer I'm pausing for a second because I want to talk about my top five favorite places on earth in no particular order and based on no objective criteria other than I just really like to travel it to these places and I want to tell you about them and explain why I like them because people ask me all the time so here I am answering your question number one is Taiwan which is secretly tied with Hong Kong but I had to choose one here and Taiwan's from fresher in my brain and so I chose Taiwan I went to Taiwan with is and the boys to shoot is his show called traveling repeat which by the way is really good and you should just go watch it on the youtubes meter channel anyway what I loved about Taiwan is that it felt like this unique fusion of cultures Taiwan is at its root a part of China in history and culture but due to years of Japanese occupation there's also some very Japanese vibes to it in the architecture in the food and in just the general culture of the place definitely has some Japanese influence but Taiwan has its own very unique particular culture that it's not totally Chinese and is not totally Japanese it is Taiwanese a big part of that culture is food and a big part of that food culture is street food [Music] but of all the stuff we did in Taiwan my absolute favorite part was this you don't have to go very far outside the big cities to find these misty mountains they're like jungly and beautiful and they go forever and they're abundant you don't run into other people it's not like there's just one tourist destination we drove through these mountains shooting is a show from tea plantations to Hot Springs to noodle making operations it was so nice and peaceful and it was like lightly drizzling the whole time because we were like in a cloud there's not to make our own tea which was just a lifelong dream of mine it's wonderful like I said I'm incredibly torn between Taiwan which we just went to this year and Hong Kong where we were last year which are very different and unique and then right but have a lot of these similar qualities which is hyper urban culture street food mixed with like nature that's like woven into it all and both places are amazing number two southern Utah every time I go to Southern Utah I forget how amazing it is you drive just a few hours south of Salt Lake and you suddenly feel like you're entering a different planet the geology the color of the rocks even the way the light feels is just different what I love about southern Utah is the abundance of nature you don't have to go to the big national parks like Zion in order to see some incredible incredible stuff you can see it on the side of the road you can go down random gravel roads and end up in really beautiful spots it reminded me that even though I like to chase adventures in other countries sometimes here at home there are some of the most kind of exotic and wild things waiting so southern Utah is my number two here number three is a little town in Belgium club livin lovin is right outside of Brussels and while Brussels and Bruges and Antwerp tend to get the most kind of attention from visitors lovin is a diamond in the rough [Music] most people don't really know about it or think about it I only discovered this place because I was speaking at like a conference that was there for like a bunch of like Flemish speaking journalists Leuven is like effectively just like a big village that at least the inner city feels just so quiet and approachable while still having some bustle and buzz that gives it charm there are big old traditional European squares filled with amazing restaurants and bars the place is bikable there are amazing forests and parks you're right on the edge of a huge forest at part of Belgium and so you are just surrounded by really beautiful nature we were biking in love in one evening and stumbled upon this really old structure that is now I think a part of the University but for real what we just stumble on Lovan just felt like a peaceful wonderful place full of interesting culture and sights and just a well-designed town that was definitely worth a visit I'm really glad we found a live-in okay so number four on this list is southern Iceland I went there originally not as a tourist but as a journalist I was there interviewing the prime minister of Iceland for the Netflix episode of explained which is Fox's show that I did on the gender pay gap so we were interviewing the prime minister and I got to enter Iceland not from kind of the tourists door but from like the I'm there trying to understand the culture and talking to people members of civil society and the government and the Prime Minister and like having those types of conversations and so in that process I gained this appreciation for Iceland not just as a beautiful place but as like a hyper progressive country that is doing really amazing interesting policy experiments and kind of leading the charge on a lot of these social issues fast forward a little bit earlier this year is and I went to Iceland for just a few days I feel like I should feel like I should draw the graph on this beach yeah to go as tourists I surprised her for her birthday we found cheap tickets and we ended up in Iceland in January and everyone told us don't go to Iceland in January because it's gonna be dark and it's gonna be cold and you won't see anything and I was like but the tickets are so cheap so I couldn't help myself turns out going to Iceland in January is sweet because there's no one there and yeah it's dark some of the time but like you still get from like 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. of like this beautiful sunset sunrise light that is just really wild [Music] all of this contributes to Iceland just feeling like a different planet so we spent four days touring the south of the country which is a very well trodden very popular and touristy part of the country but even still we felt secluded and alone a lot of the time Iceland has obviously gotten tons and tons of tourism in fact I made this chart for an earlier video that shows how many tourists go to Iceland now and for some of us me included that can be a turn-off like Oh Iceland is cool I'm not gonna go to Iceland I will say there's a reason there is a reason why this place is a destination there are some really negative ramifications for the local nature and culture of all of this tourism which is a problem in of itself but if you're a respectful visitor and you want to go engage with this beautiful beautiful place you definitely should they might be trending but it's sweet [Music] whoa where did you come from yeah I need to I needed a change of space okay well I'm on number four southern Iceland did you like southern Iceland I should go back anyway number five and the last one on this list which by no means is comprehensive or objective as I've said but number five of the places I love most in the world right now is Porto Portugal [Music] so let's be clear about one thing all of Portugal is amazing it is a small country that has an extreme diversity of landscapes and histories Portugal's great at the very top of Portugal is this old old old city centre in fact it's like one of the oldest population centres in all of Europe a port though or in Portuguese like o port though I don't know for me Porto didn't have any specific one site or attraction that made it worth visiting it was just the general energy and vibe of the city that just like stole my heart the place is on this hill with this big bridge going across this river it's one of the older bridges in Europe and it just has this unique double-decker design you can get on a boat and see all of the bridges the architecture and the design of the city and the food and the culture like it just all felt very enlightening for me as someone who wasn't super aware of Portuguese culture and Porto felt like a good representation of at least some of this history of this country yeah Porto was good okay I know I said five but I like I'm having a bit of a hard time because there's one more that I can't not mention on this list which may be actually my favorite one and I don't know why I'm mentioning it last but here it is the Jungfrau region of Switzerland [Applause] [Music] this place had been on my mind for a decade probably the most popular part of the Swiss Alps and so a lot of people go there kind of is their first time but again like Iceland that didn't cheapen it for me you realize that these valleys these mountains these trains and cable cars and funiculars are seen as a world destination for a reason what I love about it is that the Swiss have mastered mobility movement moving around really really rugged terrain in like the smoothest most efficient way so they have these big mountains and they've just built all of this infrastructure to allow you to get around you by the Jungfrau paths and you can get on all of these transportation mechanisms and just weave around these valleys and mountains we happened to have gone at the very end of the season we went mid-october and off and just merrily and I've seen just risky because things are closing but it also means an empty drain and D restaurants not mad about it it's risky to because the weather could be yeah we got amazing weather somehow and there was plenty of stuff open and we just lucked out there was no one there I really felt like we had the whole place to ourselves which is rare in the entire region we like to kind of take those Gamble's with this offseason stuff look like right on the threshold whence the weather supposed to get bad and would go anyway and the lodging is usually cheaper less people sometimes we get hit with a lot of bad weather sometimes we don't and in this case we didn't and it was amazing and it chopped up as probably one of my favorite trips of all time is actually made an entire like guide of what exactly we did day by day in the Jungfrau region which I will link below so that's my list of five really six places that have made the list of my favorite places in the world right now this list is always changing I'm always changing myself but the reason I'm thinking about this right now the reason I'm talking about this is kind of a theme that's coming up a lot here on this channel but also like in my own life which is I'm trying to think about travel not just as the status quo part of my life that is my job I got into this because of the thrill of going and learning about new places and I want my travel which to me is a privilege is something that is something that humans have not been able to do for thousands of years and now we have the technology to be able to move around the world so seamlessly like I want when I do jet off on an airplane across the world like that I do it intentionally and I do it to add value to my life and that of my family we're learning that we're connecting that we are going as more enlightened and travelers and so I'm checking in a lot with my motives and my kind of approach to travel recently which is why I'm talking about it all the time I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video today Skillshare is this amazing platform and community where you can go learn a bunch of stuff from creative skills to entrepreneurial skills to passion based skills to whatever skill you want to Skillshare probably has something for you on Skillshare you pay a monthly subscription fee and then you get unlimited access to all of these tutorials there's one course in particular that I can recommend from Skillshare which is this one about mastering illustrator illustrator the Adobe software as someone who does animation and video you might be like why are you into illustrator because illustrator has changed my life as a designer and someone who makes animation if I didn't have a fluency in illustrator I wouldn't be able to do what I do with animation in After Effects learning illustrator its kind of not the obvious choice but I can tell you it is a smart choice so skill shares got that great course among thousands of others because they're sponsoring this video you can go to the link in the descriptions which is the link with my name at the back of it so if you click that link you will go and get two months of free Skillshare I mean you won't pay for two months and you can decide if you like it if it fits within your world if you're interested I think after the trial ends it's like 10 bucks a month if you do the annual pricing so it's pretty darn cheap for what you're getting I'm a big believer in online learning obviously all of my skills came from online learning and so I have a soft spot in my heart for this kind of stuff so thank you Skillshare for sponsoring this video thank you all for watching and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How the Dutch Beat the Ocean | Why Amsterdam Has Canals",
    "video_id": "XoEZvSl5Cg8",
    "captions": "(bicycle wheels rattling) (upbeat music) - It's the ocean versus the Dutch. That's the battle that's\ngoing on right now. (ticking) It's been going on for hundreds of years and you know, who's winning, the Dutch. (upbeat music) See all that water, it's super ingenious the\nway they designed it. Can you tell the engineering marvel? - If I hear one more\nthing about the water. (upbeat music) - Look at this map of Holland in 1300, compare this to a map of Holland today. The country has gained land. Yes, thousands and thousands\nof square kilometers of land has been won back from the ocean. (ticking) The story of this battle\nbetween the ocean and the Dutch explains why Holland is good at cheese, why Amsterdam has canals, Why Dutch people ride bikes. (upbeat music) - And for those who are confused, the Dutch, Netherlands and\nHolland are all the same thing and they all have different reasons and I'm not gonna go into them. You can like, look at Wikipedia. This is just when I use those words, it all has to do with the same\nthing, which is this country, okay? (upbeat music) So the Netherlands or Holland\nor whatever you wanna call it is a country that is sinking. It's actually... the majority of it is under sea level or right at sea level. (upbeat music) I mean, if you look at the map of Holland, you see that a lot of it is just these little strips of land that are right up in the North sea and the ocean and the wind just kind of eat away at\nthis land year after year. Instead of fleeing these\ncoastal communities that were slowly sinking into the water, about 500 years ago, the\nDutch started to fight back. (upbeat music) Now, let's just be clear about one thing, which is, fighting the ocean, the incessant, timeless\npowerhouse, the ocean, is a very difficult thing. Where are we going? - Texel - What? (upbeat music) Texel? - Texel. (upbeat music) - We made it. - We made it. (upbeat music) - This battle between the\nNetherlands and the ocean is now much more real for me, and this wind and these waves are so crazy and consistent. They're just eating this land alive and yet the Netherlands\nhave decided to fight back and they're doing a pretty darn good job. (upbeat music) - Holland is up for this task. They've developed a whole system, a whole science behind\nhydrological engineering that has allowed them to combat the effects and the erosion of the ocean. - My favorite is the Curry ketchup, and Johnny loves the (indistinct) and they actually go really well together. Like us. (laughs) (upbeat music) - Okay, so how do they actually do this? This is where it gets really interesting. (upbeat music) There are a few techniques\nthat the Dutch use for their wizardry over the water. The first one has to do\nwith them building a wall around a body of water that\nthey want to turn into land. Build a wall around it and\nthen they, back in the day, would build a windmill next to those walls and they would use the windmill to spin, and as the windmill would spin, that would spin a pump that\nwould pump the water out of that land. (upbeat music) They'll plant on it, and they will do whatever they need to do to actually make it a\nfirm, dry, habitable land and then they'll build entire cities on. (upbeat music) And then in 1932, Holland had a huge win. (upbeat music) There's this giant part of the country that was a part of the sea. And they finally built this huge wall. (upbeat music) Building this giant\nwall, created a barrier between the saltwater sea and\nmade this huge body of water into a fresh water lake. (upbeat music) After they built this wall, they then started to\nsection off little pieces of this newly created Lake, and to start to turn\nthose into land as well. So this is all of the land\nthat they have created since 1932, when they built\na wall to make this Lake. I mean, it's totally crazy. (dramatic music) The Netherlands,\nactually, a few years ago, got a new province, like a\nnew state in their country, not because of any administrative reform, but because they literally\nreclaimed a giant piece of land that used to be under the sea. (dramatic music) So much of the Dutch\ncoastline looks like this, just super fortified with asphalt and a million other building materials that they have come to for hundreds and hundreds\nof years of experimentation. It seems simple, it's like a wall, but in this wall lies the big secret to Holland not sinking, and they don't always work. There have been times\nwhen these walls break, but for the most part, this\nhas been a success story, (soft uplifting music) But it's not just\ncreating land out of water it's also just how they manage water in every one of their cities. (cheerful upbeat music) Amsterdam used to just be, I mean, you can hear it in the name, a dam on the Amstel river. (cheerful upbeat music) They then built it up and they created this series of canals, a very intentional design, as you can see, and in doing so, they made this city a\nvery accessible boat city, which was a very lucrative thing to do back in like the 1500's and 1600's. Amsterdam became an economic hub in Europe and developed a very quickly. A population boom contributed\nto the golden age of Holland. And even today, Amsterdam is a giant economic and global hub, which you can attribute to how the Dutch have just mastered water and learned how to intentionally\ndesign their cities and their country around water management. (cheerful upbeat music) A lot of the things we think\nof as quintessential of Dutch come from this culture\nof water management. And it now that sounds like the\nwonkiest thing in the world, but listen to me here, see the bikes, the bikes are a product of this low land because when you have flat land, it's relatively close together because as most of the\nland is waterlogged, then bikes become a really efficient, viable transportation means. You also have some of the most\nfertile grounds in the world for growing grass, which then becomes\nfertile pastures for cows, which produce amazing dairy products, which is why Dutch cheese is\nsuch wonderful, amazing cheese. And then of course there are windmills. Windmills are a huge Dutch thing. Windmills come from this\nhistory of pumping water from lakes and the ocean to\ncreate new pieces of land. For a long time windmills\nwere the technology, which is why Poland is full of windmills. Finally, you have these tulips. Tulips are another huge Dutch thing. The reason for this is that tulips grow in this special clay-sand-soil mixture and a lot of that exact soil\nis right here in Holland because of the fact\nthat a lot of this land was under water before they reclaimed it, and so it's perfect for growing tulips. So a lot of Dutch culture could be attributed to water management and conquering the water. (upbeat music) I hope you now understand\nwhy Amsterdam has canals and the marvel of Dutch water management. So much more to learn.

    "captions": "[Music] this summer I jumped off a bridge [Music] probably 65 feet tall I've jumped off it probably a dozen times in my life mostly when I was a teenager but this time I kind of started to drift a little bit back and when they hit the water I felt like pain my entire back and then I couldn't walk for a little bit yeah it's pretty bad so I probably won't jump off that bridge again but it was fine this summer while I was working on boarders India I went back west to where I grew up and while I was there on this trip I thought a lot about a question I get often which is what is it like to have a job and a lifestyle where you're constantly moving around and in foreign places and I think I'm starting to develop an answer to that question so let me tell you the story of the summer and maybe share with you some of the reflections I've had while I was on the road [Music] so I first started in Utah we did what you should do if you go to Utah which is spend time in the mountains we also went to the south of the state where we explore Zion National Park and went on one of the most beautiful hikes I've ever been on in my life then we went up to Park City which is like an hour from Salt Lake and participated in their town wide dinner that they have they shut down Main Street they put a bunch of tables out and you can sit there on this giant communal table and eat dinner with a bunch of random people which was kind of fun and amazing and Park City in the summer is kind of a dream this whole time I was spending 12-hour days in a coffee shop working on borders India the writing the editing the animation and it was this kind of crazy moment of intense days and then during the night having some like very concentrated family time [Music] from there I went down to Reno Nevada where I spent a weekend with some of my buddies from college linked oh is this very cold but very beautiful lake in California and Nevada and it was such a great time catching up with these people who I went to call it with and - I haven't really seen in a lot of years [Music] from there I flew home to Oregon [Music] [Music] Ashland Oregon which is the town I was born in and where I spent the first 19 years of my life [Music] our hands have since moved away from that town and none of my siblings live there and it was my first time back in in a lot of years and it kind of blew my mind [Music] blew my mind to be in this place that I hadn't been in years this place I had grown up in and take it for granted and suddenly felt like I was seen it from a totally new perspective from an outsider's perspective and I realized like wow this place is beautiful a strange feeling when you experience something that is incredibly familiar but you have enough distance from it in terms of how much time it's been since you've been there that it also feels novel so it's like you're experiencing it for the first time from a new perspective but it's also incredibly familiar that is the weirdest feeling of nostalgia meets novelty and it's intense it's like an intense feeling and that's exactly what I was feeling the entire time I was in Ashland [Music] [Music] - Linda's mainly stayed the same but since I lived there I've changed completely and I've seen the world [Music] [Laughter] [Music] from there we drove to one of the most special parts of the world from you which is the Oregon coast Oregon has this big rugged coastline on the Pacific Ocean and it just feels so abundant and open [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm telling you all this for a reason which is the answer this question of what is it like to have a life when you are constantly in foreign places and experiencing new things the summer I filled my tank with these familiar connections being out in nature in familiar landscape with people that I've known for decades and connecting with places that have a lot of meaning for me that was really quieting for my soul this was a really necessary counterbalance to what had been a year of non-stop going to other unfamiliar places what this means is as my little family grows and as I think about my career growing as I think about things like borders and this channel and this company we're launching in in December I am going to be thinking about the best most intentional way to make travel a life-giving and like positive experience it was a good summer overall borders published and I got to be in these beautiful familiar places and you can't really ask for more than that I want to thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video I've talked about Skillshare a lot before because I believe in skill share and love skill share and believe in the ethos of the brand and the mission of the company skill share if you don't know what it is is a online learning platform where you can browse like thousands and thousands of different tutorials that are really high quality and really approachable everything from design to video to photography to coding to animation like all you can learn whatever you want there's one course in particular that I really like on Skillshare it's called animation for graphic designers which is a really helpful course for learning really elegant ways to move shapes and text to make flat 2d logos or other text elements come to life the cool thing is you can subscribe to Skillshare and for a monthly fee and you get unlimited access to all of this stuff if you subscribe to the annual subscription it's less than ten bucks a month because they're sponsoring this video you can sign up with my specific link and get two months of this for free so you can try it out and see if it's useful for what you are interested in learning in your day to day life Thank You Skillshare for sponsoring this video thanks for watching I will be back with another video soon I actually have a really fun video lined up that has to do with explaining why Amsterdam has ten holes so take a look out for that all right have a great day [Music]"

    "captions": "[Music] does anyone else love Taco Bell as much as I do bean burritos Kato soft taco beefy Fritos ooh crunchy tacos beef supreme chalupa I'm in Utah in a random town on i-15 going south from Salt Lake City I'm headed to one of the most special places in the world to me which is southern Utah I dressed burrito hot frito taco frito it has Fritos in this hike that we're going on called the subway only 80 people are allowed to do it every day so they have limited permits and they give them out in a lottery even if you could chosen then you get to do the hike and we got lucky and we won the lottery we've got a permit and now I need a map [Music] okay I got mouths oh gosh at that time to eat borders put the maps down in and bring it on in I'm trying to find it's almost bedtime but there's a ghost town about abandoned places that is just so haunting and I just love it I'm excited for tomorrow I've never been inside of these really really narrow canyons so pretty excited to go explore but for now bedtime [Music] [Music] [Music] all right this is a giant Canyon and really what we're standing on right now is a huge slab of rock and when I say huge I mean like hundreds of kilometers long look at us if you were to follow this slab of rock a little bit more southeast from here you would get to the lowest point which is the Grand Canyon this huge slab of rock gets called the Colorado Plateau has lots of little canyons has a big Canyon the Grand Canyon but it has lots of other little canyons one of them is Zion Canyon which is the canyon we are hanging out in right now actually technically were right next door to Zion Canyon in kolob canyon anyway these are all canyons that tell the story of a slab of rock that has been whittled down over millions of years by erosion we are descending into the valley that has been cut out by the water and we're actually gonna go into a little canyon a very narrow canyon that is a very young canyon meaning it hasn't been cut very wide and you will see why [Music] [Applause] [Music] chicka Bow Wow [Music] it's technically backcountry here meaning there's no official trail no markings you just create your own adventure which is [Music] okay this is slippery it's good this one's super solid okay I'm good I'm good famous last words [Music] so these big walls of rock you can see are full of layers tons of layers layers layers layers layers layers all of these layers in the rock tell a little story of what was happening on the earth in this area at some point millions of years ago youtell used to be in the ocean under the water and then it wasn't and then it was and then it wasn't and then it was so every time the ocean would rise he would bring a new set of minerals and sediment into this area and it would that would become the new bottom of the ocean in this area and then the ocean would go away for a little bit and that sediment would settle and solidify and eventually turn into rock so what you get is this story that's etched into the rock layer by layer by layer and it's just beautiful water starts to get you doing okay back there oh I'm not don't worry I'm not worrying about you and eventually with enough water and flooding going through these cracks in what was once the solid rock you get something that looks like this the canyon we're going to is it much younger canyon it's still in the process of being widened what that looks like I guess we'll find out very soon we're about to get into this Canyon [Music] that's where it all begins right here this really narrow cut out in the rock is cut up by this water and now every second that this water runs through here it cuts it a little bit more in a million years Union [Music] [Music] [Music] here's the big caveat though not all rocks erode equally they erode in different ways and on different timescales and that I think is really important as soon as we get into this Canyon we'll see why [Music] oh my gosh Wow Wow Wow Wow so like I was saying not all rock layers erode equally the majority of Zion the thickest part of the sediment is what's called Navajo Sandstone which is really really hard to erode right underneath the Navajo Sandstone is this Kayenta stone more of a mud stone or silt stone it was deposited before the Navajo Sandstone and it was a much more silty muddy thing and it erodes a lot easier and so these formations you can see this happening frozen in time where the Navajo Sandstone is resistant to being eroded but the Chi enta right underneath it is getting more and more eroded because it just reacts so much more to water and that's why you get this crazy circular feel to this formation which is why it's called the subway like a tunnel so I want to tell you about the tripod I've been using it's a brand new tripod is actually not even for so I'm just using the prototype from peak design big design is makes this bag this bag I've been using for three years they came out with this tripod and I'm like wait I kind of had thought of them as like a bag making company and like suddenly they're making a tripod okay so they sent me this tripod I've been using it a lot and have really held off on giving thoughts on it until I really used it well I've been using it and I freaking love it like I love love it it is tiny so many amazing little tactile features that allow me to move it and adjust it in really natural ways and yet it's really light and it fits in the water bottle compartment of my backpack I love the plate that it comes with this little square plate that you can use on the tripod and then you can put it on the little peep clip I've had the pig clip forever but I've never actually used it because I've always had a Manfrotto plate on the bottom of my camera so I'm really into it and I'm gonna be using it now for everything and no longer you're gonna be using my Manfrotto tripod just sad Pete told me they wanted feedback and any critiques or downsides only thing I can think of is if they have like a quick-release plate that I could put on like my gimbal and stuff so I could use this plate and like quickly put it on my gimbal as well or put it on other things like mount it that would be amazing wish the plate that the complaint on the bottom could screw on and off with like a hand screw instead of an allen wrench I don't know these are tiny things I'd like to scrape in the bottom of the barrel here to like come up with feedback but the reality is this is an amazing tripod so tripods not for sale yet because it is in the middle of a Kickstarter camp is the cheapest now that it will ever be so if you go pre-order it now it'll be cheaper there's carbon fiber and there's aluminum and I've got the carbon fiber which is feather-light if you lumina ms great - it's just a bit heavier and cheaper see it's like the perfect travel tripod it really is like for the type of filmmaking I do nimble lean like I just need something that's solid but small and this is this does it so thank you peak design for making a beautiful tripod thank you for sending me this tripod thanks for sponsoring this video your turning around we're headed back down subway [Music] you [Music]"

    "captions": "so I'm in New York City and I'm Dyslexic dyslexia has a lot to do with the term decoding if you are a human and you live in the modern world which is literally every person watching this video right now your life is decoding our world is made up of symbols a bunch of symbols that don't inherently mean like look at this symbol this symbol means something to you only because it's been given meaning by our society or your culture your language but what about this symbol a lot of you have no idea what this symbol means it doesn't mean anything to you but to others it does [Music] [Laughter] [Music] happy woman it wasn't like a five-dollar pork bun yeah that's like it's trying to be - shall we yeah it's like the real deal all right let's go eat these I mean your whole school experience is one giant lesson in decoding books and symbols and images to give meaning and knowledge to your brain if you're dyslexic this whole decoding thing is hard especially when it gets really advanced and you have pages and pages of all of these random symbols and you're supposed to make meaning out of them that's really difficult for someone who has dyslexia I'm gonna stop using fancy language here and just say it straight if you're dyslexic you suck at reading [Music] if you look at a page most people are able to single out these lines and track along them quickly and seamlessly decoding the words into Meeny when I look at a page like this my brain sees something a little bit more like this tracking along these lines is just a really clunky process for me that's a downer a year ago we were in Hong Kong for borders birthday and this year we're in Catalan and we're just falling in love with this do you think [Music] hello a so what does this all mean well being a dyslexic a child you just kind of feel not very smart at least I didn't there was always special meetings I had to have with my teacher and my parents to like come up with alternative learning schedules and like big learning goals and all of these things that basically made me feel like look you're not getting this what this did is it kind of instilled this idea that like okay I'm not one of the smart kids and that's okay I actually made peace with this by the time I was in middle school you really start to have to read a lot more and so that's where my mom started to read to me like these longer books which was really embarrassing when you're like an eighth grader and your mom's reading to you thank you mom seriously though so sweet my mother then would go out and find audiobooks when I was in high school you know this wasn't like a long time ago but you know it's in the 2000s when audio books were on cassettes all this is to say my mother is lovely and so so so supportive and wonderful and really helped me through this and none of us knew that it was dyslexia like during this time I just knew it wasn't good at reading and I wasn't quote very smart so I made it through high school didn't get great grades didn't get good test scores but like made it through college was my nightmare I mean college was fun I liked college but for the reading aspect college was a nightmare for someone with dyslexia I still don't know him dyslexic I just know that I hate reading and in college everything is about reading you devour these textbooks you come and discuss what you read and it's like hundreds of pages of reading a night that was just never ever gonna happen to me so this is where I start to develop creative solutions to get my way around reading so I start to record the lectures for my professors like the classes I would record them and listen to them over and over again while I would like go on runs or while I was like walking up to campus or whatever it was and this way I was able to let the content sink in but not have to do the 50 or 60 pages of reading not the best solution but definitely the only solution I had at my fingertips to get through a lot of these heavy reading classes in college incidentally I also had an issue with writing because I didn't do a lot of reading I wasn't a super good writer I was not a very good typist couldn't spell super well and so my second kind of creative solution was starting to lean into visuals as my way of presenting things so instead of like writing a paper for a project I would say like hey can I like make a video about it or can I like do like an infographic or something like that and on the other side of college what I came away with is that I could learn I just wasn't going to do it in the traditional way that was going to be doing it through these creative solutions of finding other alternative ways of ingesting information and sharing that information or communicating that information and then I go into a neurologist at George Washington Medical Center in DC and get officially diagnosed which doesn't mean anything there's no like medicine or like therapy for dyslexia what it means though is that you're suddenly validated in like okay I'm not just not smart or like I'm not just not disciplined with books I actually have something wrong with my brain and that was incredibly freeing for me I think her least valid ating [Music] it's time for an ADD because well gotta feed my family somehow right well you feed our family - together we will feed our family with Internet ads I'm gonna tell you the rest of the story but for this video I reached out specifically to audible which is a company that I use and have used for many years back in like I think it was you know the early 2010s when I started to discover audible and that's when I started to devour devour audiobooks I started to average 25 books a year which it was like from a guy who would read one book a year suddenly I'm reading 25 books a year like this changed my entire life audible in case you don't know is this giant repository of audiobooks this app has been like a integral part of my world so many books one that I just read it's about India it's called Midnight's Furies it is an amazing book I'm just finishing it now and it has really informed a lot of my writing and thinking about India lately very informative very well-written very detailed so if you're interested in audible you can go to this link audible.com slash Johnny Harris and you can get a 30-day free trial where you get a book any book you want for free and you get two audible originals which is like content that they've created themselves that you can pick from like a big repository the ad is over thank you for listening I'm now here in lower Manhattan at the box office we're here because is is hosting this event for eater tonight because of her Taiwan stuff and I'm just +18 I'm just hanging out I'm gonna finish this story of what dyslexia looks like when you're in your 20s and now in my early 30s but I have to go up and say hi to my teammates and hang out and get some work done but I'll I'll pick it up in a minute [Music] I pulled battery kind of died on the camera and just like I I just I just got too busy eating Taiwanese food at that eater event did great is no serious is you gonna finish this story about dyslexia and what that means for me is like a 31 year old person so let's get out of here go into the city and continue the story and bagel is one of our favorite spots if not our total favorite spot in the city bagels till Brooklyn bagel on a tab lovely okay so we're talking my current life with dyslexia which is a very different life than school and university during school and university days dyslexia basically exacerbated the reality that I was not good at learning in an informal environment and just made it drudgery and difficulty all the time now that I'm in the real world where reading books and taking tests and jumping through like formal hoops is not the measure of success I find it much much easier to feel like I'm smart and that I can be successful taking multiple-choice tests is not the measure of success in the real world in my 20s and now into my early 30s I feel like dyslexia yeah as a big part of my life and it affects my day to day experience to some degree meaning when I'm like looking at a list of things and I'm supposed to like find a name or a number or something I like sometimes literally cannot find it like I cannot see it even though it's like right there but it doesn't affect my ability to have a successful career or to learn things or to have good relationships or any of those things that are to me just way more important than multiple-choice tests if anything dyslexia and the experience of having to find creative solutions to my problems in school has made me a more resourceful person in the sense that typical mechanisms for learning and doing things don't work for me all the time and so I've gotten used to and comfortable with finding alternative solutions usually creative solutions to make things happen and I think that's our move with some really useful tools when it comes to making videos or building things or executing or whatever so if anything I feel like dyslexia while it is a a mental kind of hindrance in some ways it also has given me tools that I'm really grateful for I don't know what dislikes it feels like for other people and I'm sure it's not exactly the same is it what it feels like for me but I would be really curious to hear your thoughts on that so if you are someone who struggles with dyslexia tell me about it like tell me what your experience is like because I'm really interested to hear that okay we're headed back to DC more borders ebony and borders coming out really soon holy smokes is this show it's coming out thanks for watching thank you audible for sponsoring this video and for teaching me how to listen to books and I'll see you next time [Music]"

    "video_id": "OwqVtZn5df8",
    "captions": "- March 23rd, 2012. (upbeat music) I was going to school in Utah. I was like a junior in college studying international relations, and I was looking for an internship. Hey, there Iz. We're just filming here. I was on the State Department's website. The State Department is\nlike the foreign ministry here in the United States. And they had an intro video,\nlike a promotional video, explaining their internship program and it was very poorly done. So in a weird moment of, I don't\neven know what got into me, I sent these people an email and I said. Well, I said some pretty mean things. \"I noticed the promo\nvideo you guys are using is extremely poorly done. I would like to make a video that is more attractive and helpful.\" What! Man, 2012, me, was a weird me. \"Lemme know if you would like me to make something and submit it. I just think that this program\ncould be more attractive if the information was presented in a more effective way,\" is how I put it. Hold on a second, this is 2012. (dramatic sounds) Okay. I didn't know very much\nabout video in 2012. I wasn't making very good videos. I was making stuff like this, and like this, and it was just not very good. In addition, I didn't know\nhow to do motion graphics. I wanted to learn how to do\nit, but I didn't know how. And yet here I am promising\nto make a promotional video which was very likely\ngoing to be all animation, and I had no animation skills. That's not true actually, to my credit, I had one animation under my\nbelt and it looked like this. That's an owl and a circle\naround the owl and it, and then it falls and then it goes down, it just down. That was my one portfolio piece. Okay. So that's me in 2012, and\nyet here I am proposing to the State Department\nthat I'm going to make them a promotional video that is\nquote attractive and helpful. Okay. Cool. So, what happens next? They responded\nenthusiastically and said yes. If you could make us a video for free we would gladly take your\nvideo and put it on our site. In this moment, something\nhappened in my brain. I chalk this up as one of the\ninflection points in my life. It's something that\nwould continue to happen throughout my career and that would take my animation skills from this, to this. (upbeat music) I'm gonna call this process, this thing that happened, a speed boost. Just like in Mario Kart, when\nyou're like cruising along and you see those flashy arrows on the ground and you like hit them and it speed boost you forward. (car speeding sound) It's like a hack. It's like something that\ngives you more speed than you naturally have. After I got that email back\nfrom the State Department, I began to devour tutorials. I began to just focus on this\nvideo all day and all night. I began to learn so much faster than I'd ever learned before. I call this, what was happening to me, excited accountability. So after three weeks of\nintense, excited accountability I made this video, my first\nreal motion graphic project. Unless you count the owl,\nwhich was technically my first and it's pretty dear to my heart. Love that owl. Let's face it, when it\ncomes to internships with the State Department\nnot all college students can afford to travel to\nWashington DC or overseas. Okay. I mean, it's not like great. I went from knowing nothing truly to knowing a ton about motion graphics and having gotten my hands\ndirty for the first time. And that was facilitated through this excited accountability. Soon BSFS will begin the\nmicro volunteering program. What's that ask? Here's a problem, when you\nwant to learn something new, you become passionate about it. If you wanna learn to bake bread suddenly you have a super high\ntolerance for reading about yeast fermentation. If you wanna learn photography suddenly you're able to sit down and learn about shutter speed and aperture, these fairly boring principles. But now you suddenly have the attention span of like a genius. Two weeks goes by and\nsuddenly that passion, that tolerance for boring stuff\nbecomes thinner and thinner, and you eventually pear out. This was me in 2012. I had made it through a few\nweeks of learning this stuff when my motivational\nfuel started to burn up. I started to feel less and less inclined to actually sit through the tutorials. Then I wrote that email,\nI got that response and this happened (car speeding) My motivation was back. My tank was full. I was going fast. I had accountability. I was excited. And suddenly my ability to\npersist through this kinda difficult process of learning\nincreased like tenfold. (dramatic music) So this is easier said than done. And a lot of people ask me\nlike, how do you actually go about learning this stuff? Yeah, you've got the speed boost. Yeah, you have like\nthe excited motivation, but like what do you\nactually do to learn this if you don't have film school or some sort of structure to learn? The answer to me and kind of the key to my career when it comes to learning this stuff has been the internet. - [Reporter] On your mark, get set. \u266a We're riding on the internet. \u266a - I have a really soft spot in my heart for learning online, and because of that, I reached out to Skillshare\nto sponsor this video. Because Skillshare is one of the sites that I've used over the years to learn and refine my visual storytelling skills. Skillshare is like this giant\nrepository of tutorials. It's like 10 bucks a\nmonth, and you get access to like 25,000 tutorials. If you wanna learn animation\nlike I did in 2012, there are tons, tons of\ntutorials on the site that will teach you all\ndifferent aspects of animation. There's one specifically\ncalled animated infographics and data visualization\nwhich was kind of the style that I was doing in that, in 2012. It's really good, like quality teaching. So, if you're kind of in a place right now where you want to learn something new, whether it's animation or\na million other skills, Skillshare has got like\ntons of different topics. Then go click the link, and if you are one of the first 500, you will\nget two months for free. Meaning, you don't have to pay. And then after that it's 10 bucks a month. Go start learning stuff. (upbeat music) Skillshare doesn't have any\ninfluence over this video or what I say or anything,\nbut they did want to partner with me on this video\nbecause this is something that I truly 100% believe in and want other people\nto experience as well. (clock ticking) (owl hooting) (inaudible) don't need to travel abroad. Okay, so am I recommending\nthat everyone reach out to the State Department and\noffer to redo their promo video? No. This is an example that\nillustrates a point of putting yourself in a situation of excited accountability. First, let's talk about what you need to make the situation work. It's right there within\nexcited accountability. First you need to be excited. Whatever situation you put yourself in, that's going to teach you these skills. You have to like be interested in it. You have to align with\nwhatever the message is or whatever the project is. That sort of passion and\nexcitement about the project is going to be a key part of the fuel. The other aspect of this,\nthe other side of it is the accountability part. There needs to be a\ngood amount of pressure. Not like the anxiety,\nlike fear based pressure. Like, that's actually like a\nspeed bump, not a speed boost. I mean the type of pressure\nthat like you want to deliver because you want to impress. And if you don't deliver,\nyou'll feel a little bit like. That sort of pressure needs to be there 'cause that's gonna propel\nyou forward as well. A good balance of excitement\nand accountability or pressure together will make\na situation that is primed for you to learn and to\nhave the speed boost. So lemme give you some examples\nthat aren't State Department maybe you want to learn how to cook. So instead of just like telling yourself, \"Okay, I wanna learn how to cook.\" You can invite a friend\nor some friends over for a dinner party and you\nare gonna be the one to cook, and you tell them that. If you were interested in\nthe cuisine or the dish that you're cooking and you feel a little bit of pressure because people are coming over to your house, suddenly you've just created a situation of excited accountability. All right, so let's step up\nthe stakes one more notch to a professional level. Let's say you have some video skills, but they're not in the place\nthat you can actually go pitch like a brand or an\norganization or a news outlet to make video for them. You don't have those skills yet, but you want to acquire them. In this case, I suggest\ngoing to a nonprofit or a group that doesn't have a ton of marketing budget and say, \"Hey, I will make a video for you.\" And you develop a kind of a\npseudo professional relationship even though money's not changing hands, and it's not that professional, the stakes are not so high\nthat if you don't deliver, you're like reneging on a contract. But they're high enough\nthat you want to deliver. And suddenly you'll be in that excited accountability situation, and here comes the speed\nboost.(cartoon car speeding) The last example I wanna give you is another one that\ncomes from my experience. Now we're talking summer of 2015. (dramatic music) Thanks to this excited\naccountability process, I had done it several times with a bunch of different organizations. I had learned quite a bit of skills and I was able to get a\nlegitimate job in motion graphics. Eventually that led me\nto getting a job at Vox, where I was doing motion\ngraphics and animation. I wanted to take my\nskills to the next level. And specifically I really wanted to get into doing documentaries. I had never done documentaries. I had never made a\nlegitimate like documentary out in the field, but I wanted to learn. So I went to my boss, at Vox, and I said, \"Hey, what if I went out\nand made an explainer like we do here but I did it in the field, pointing my camera at\nthings, getting interviews, and then animating on top of that.\" At that time Vox was a startup. And Joe, my boss, was like, \"Could you write it, and film it, and edit it, and animated\nall on your own?\" And if so, like go for it. And I was like, \"Okay.\" So I pitched this Cuba\nstory and I was given some great support from the people at Vox to be able to have, do this experiment. But the message was very clear. \"You can do this, but\nit needs to be good.\" Meaning if we're gonna\ninvest in this new format that's a little bit costlier\nto have you go travel to Cuba, then it has to be like\nworth the resources. In the summer of 2015, that\nfamiliar feeling came upon me. (cartoon car speeding) I remember I was sitting\nin a hotel in Miami the night before I was flying to Cuba. There was $2,000 in\ncash sitting on the bed, because in Cuba they don't take bank cards you have to like literally\nbring a ton of cash, which is terrifying. And I'm sitting there\nwith this mandate of, if this isn't good it's\nnot going to happen again, like 100% responsibility on the situation that I've put myself in. Excited. Yes, I was definitely excited. I mean, look at that face. That's an excited me,\nbut also accountable, pressure, responsibility. Both of those things were happening to me at the most extreme levels that they had ever\nhappened to me in my life. And there's something\nthat I can't even explain that's just like spilling out of me. I've now done this\nprocess a bunch of times, but this was like the most intense. So that night I did what I had been doing for weeks up until that moment\nwhich is downloading videos, videos that I really loved\nfrom like Vimeo and YouTube, downloading them and them up in QuickTime and watching them frame\nby frame and writing down, \"Oh, that edit was really fast, and it went from this angle to that angle. Oh the guy moved his\ncamera kind of like this. That was really interesting,\nI'm gonna do that in Cuba.\" Like a giant list of\nexactly what I was gonna do to up my skills. Because I was in this highly motivated, highly responsible, and\naccountable situation that learning was sinking in. I was learning in a whole new way. At the time I watched a Skillshare course about creative transitions, like how to move your camera around in\nthese kinds of creative ways to build out transitions in your videos. And like I was devouring\nthis tutorial, like knowing that I was gonna have to use this stuff in this situation that I'd put myself in. I learned so much. I was so ready to go to Cuba and perform. (upbeat music) In the end I made three\nvideos and there were the best videos that I'd ever made in my life. That was another inflection\npoint for me, that Cuba trip. I feel grateful to Vox for\ngiving me that opportunity. Joe, my boss was very, very like open to those types of experiments. And so I'm incredibly\ngrateful to Vox for that but I'm also grateful for what\nhappens to the human brain when you feel that excited accountability. You can really really learn a lot without the need of school. So thanks to Skillshare\nfor sponsoring this video, but also thanks to Skillshare\nfor just being around, for being a repository\nof high quality learning on the internet for 10 bucks a month so that all of us can access it. Again if you want to try Skillshare out for two months for free,\nyou can click the link down in the description and just see if it like is interesting to you. Good teaching and good\nlearning, visual learning like you see on Skillshare\nis a way to kind of help pave that process and\nmake it a little bit easier. So, I hope this is helpful. I would love to hear your\nfeedback about this process and what we talked about today. And yeah, I got to go\nback to editing borders because there's just so\nmuch borders to edit. Okay. Bye.

    "title": "How to Remember Your Life",
    "video_id": "GLy4VKeYxD4",
    "captions": "(bright upbeat music) - July 17th, 2007. (bright upbeat music continues) Do you remember where you were that day? What you were feeling? What you were doing? What you're up to that month? I was in a little town in Wales taking in these castle ruins, it's beautiful. That experience left a mark on my brain for sure. (camera shutters) What about December 13th, 2014? What were you up to? That was a less memorable\nexperience for me, but it was just a normal\nday at the house, Iz was reading a book, Henry\nhad a fever, he was sick. We had put up Christmas decorations and gone on a walk on the little trail in front of our house. Not a super memorable day. Somewhere in your brain, there is stored a memory of what happened on those two days for you. But it's probably impossible to dig it up. You probably have no\nidea what you were doing on July 17th, 2007. Remembering this stuff is hard because our brains aren't built for it. Think of this circle as what you're able to\nrecall and actively think about at any given moment. You've got a few memories\nand pieces of information that are really close by\nin case you need them. Like when I asked you what your\nphone number is, you've got that super close, nice and\nbright, easy to retrieve. But when I ask you to remember the name of your favorite school teacher, you have to stretch a little bit, but you're eventually able to retrieve it, throw it into this little\ncircle and remember it. If I ask you to tell me when\nwas the last time you saw a hamster, you'll scan\nthese bright memories and you won't find it. The last time you saw a hamster is probably way out here\nlurking in some dark part of your brain. It's there, but it's totally unretrievable and what's scary, is you don't even know that you can't remember it. You can't remember that\nyou can't remember it. You saw a hamster at some point, but it's gone. The vast majority of your life, the thousands of days that\nyou've spent on this Earth are all out here with a few bright spots for really important memories that you can retrieve pretty easily, like the first time you left the country, or the day you met your significant other, or that time you broke your wrist. But most of this stuff\nis totally unretrievable, which is totally fine. You probably don't care to remember that time you bumped your knee on the door of your\nfriend's apartment in 2015. But what about that gathering of friends that you had that same month, where the conversation was\nflowing and the food was so good and you felt alive and excited about life? To me, that's worth remembering. What was the best experience\nyou had in April of 2011? What made you happy that month? You have no idea. And maybe you don't care\nto know what happened in April of 2011, but I do. (bright upbeat music) I think it's travesty that so much of our life\nis simply forgotten. I want my memory to look more like this, with the bright spots, not\njust being the memorable trips I went on, but also the\nmundane experiences, the things that happened\nto me years and years ago. What if I could somehow\nremember simultaneously the memorable stuff? Like the first time I wandered through Rio de Janeiro?\n(camera shutters) And the mundane, but special\nstuff, like that time we went to the park with Iz's parents when Henry was two years old, back in 2015 and had like a really amazing day. I had great conversation,\nHenry was in a good mood, everyone was happy. That was a special day. And I wanna remember it. I've been thinking about this\npredicament for many years and developing processes, and workflows and ways that I can use photos and video to create a world, where I\ncan easily retrieve memories. (camera humming) I wanna share with you some\nof the guiding principles that I use, the workflows, the softwares, the philosophies that I use to do this. And hopefully, if you're\ninterested, you can start to construct a similar world of memories. Solving this issue has to do with this. You've got this amazing camera with you at all times, but\nyou've probably noticed that the solution isn't just\nto take a bunch of photos. The familiar situation is you take a bunch of photos of things that\nyou probably wanna remember and then you have so many photos\njust sitting on your phone and you don't really know\nwhat to do with them. You never end up actually looking at them. It's the great paradox\nof digital photography and it's really easy\nto get out of control. My approach to this involves photos, but it does not involve just taking photos of everything you want to remember. Secondly, I have to say that my approach to this is influenced by the research that's been done on what\nhappens to your brain when you take a picture of something. If you're walking along the cliff sides of Lima, Peru, and you\npull out your camera to take a photo, something\nhappens in your brain. Your brain starts recording less of the non-visual sensations around you. So that bird that's hanging out next to you, or the sound\nof the ocean, or the traffic, or the breeze, the smell,\nthe way you're feeling. In short, the more immersive\nexperience of being in a place. Instead, your brain hones\nin on the visual aspects of the scene. So, a year later, if someone asks you what Lima, Peru is\nlike, you will probably have a better visual memory\nof your experience there, but you won't remember\nwhat you were feeling, you won't remember the general experience. You'll remember the thing\nthat you took a photo of. Okay, you're probably done hearing me talk about the theory behind how I do this and the\nbroad research and all that. Now let me show you\nhow I actually do this. The key to remembering your\nlife is deleting photos. Okay? I'm gonna say that again. The key to remembering your\nlife is deleting photos. The antithesis to remembering your life is too many photos. You take a lot of photos,\nmany of them, you don't want. Having them in your world without you actually wanting them will cause more stress than joy. Get used to deleting photos often. I haven't reviewed all of\nthe many, many softwares that exist out there for\ndoing this sort of thing. The one thing I can say is\nthat you want a software that when you take a\nphoto with your phone, it immediately uploads it to the internet and downloads it to your computer. So that any photo you add on your computer or you take with your phone,\nyou see them in both places. I know Google Photos\ndoes this, Apple Photos does this, Lightroom Mobile does this. I'm sure it's becoming more and more of just a standard feature for all photo softwares, so\nit shouldn't be hard to find. The reason you want to do this, is because the first step\nto actually getting a handle on your pictures, is having\nthem in one central library. And that's why I very strongly\nrecommend using software, that when you take a\npicture on your phone, it shows up on your computer. Instead of scrolling through\nInstagram or Facebook for once during the day, scroll through your own pictures and delete them. In this process of deleting\nphotos and making that a habit, you get the first benefit of this system, which is, you will be looking at your photos more often. You get to a new place, or you\nhave a fun weekend somewhere and you take a bunch of\nphotos and videos of something and you're like, \"I don't\nreally need that video. \"That was a cool video\nand it was a cool thing, \"but I don't necessarily need\nto remember that in 15 years, \"so get rid of it.\" (bright upbeat music begins) Like this. I took this photo in\nMontreal, because I was like, \"Oh, I wanna remember\nthe Lonely Planet guide \"that I was using and the\nway the trees looked.\" No, and I didn't take one, I took a bunch. Let's get rid of literally all of these. Interviewing Hillary Clinton, yes, definitely I want that photo. That was a really cool day,\nI wanna remember that day. I'll pick one and delete the others. I don't need 10 pictures\nof Henry and Oliver at the pediatrician. Okay, so I'll go through. That's a cute shot. That's not, and I probably have 15. That's not. You relive the memories\nas you're deleting. Okay. As I'm deleting them here, it's deleting them on my phone too, so the clutter's just producing\nacross both my devices. Okay, so from that pediatrician day, I've got four photos. Are you starting to see how this works? Actually, I've started\nto enjoy this process. It seems like work, but it's actually an effort that helps you relive these memories and reduce clutter at the same time. If that photo doesn't do something to your brain, chemistry, get rid of it. If you're a photographer, I'm gonna talk to you for a second. If you're not a photographer,\ngo get a drink of water, because I'm about to\nuse a bunch of jargon. All right, photographer time. Photographers are probably thinking, \"I need to edit my photos, \"I want to work with RAW photos.\" Lightroom was the promise for us, where they'd say, \"No, you can have all \"of your photos organized and work with them in RAWs, edit\nthem in a robust software, \"but also see them on your phone.\" It seemed like the promise, and for the past six years, I've been using Lightroom\nboth to edit my photos and to organize them and catalog them. But as my photo library grew, it started to get out of control. Trying to manage RAW photos\nthat are 40 to 50 megabytes each, it's just insanity when you have tens of thousands of photos. Theoretically, Lightroom\nis the perfect software. But in practice, as the catalog grows, it starts to become less stable and difficult to work with. I recently had a catalog\nfail and all of that metadata that was embedded into\nthe catalog was lost. The edits, the geo data, the keywords. And that made me realize that\nI can't rely on a program, a catalog file, to have all of that really\nimportant information. So I still use Lightroom\nto edit my photos, but then I immediately\nexport them as high-res JPEGs with all of the metadata embedded into it, including the\ngeotag and everything. And then I imported into\nApple Photos as baked. I call it baked, because I like that idea of baking the RAW into a nice JPEG, that's like three megabytes. They share much quicker, you\ndon't have to export anything. I love Lightroom and I wish that it could just be the\nperfect cure-all software, but it's not. All right, I'm done talking\nto just photographers. Let's get back into this. Just to remember the mantra\nso far, the key to remembering your life is deleting photos. Okay, so we've talked about the technology and kind of the workflow. What about when you're\nin a beautiful place? What if you're in Porto,\nPortugal, which is one of my favorite cities\nright now, by the way, and it's sunset, and you're in this beautiful\nplace, and this view, and you want to document\nit and remember the night and the buzz in the air. How do you document that place and that memory in a way that will help you relive\nit later on in your life? Back to that research that we talked about, when you're taking\na picture of something, you're making a little bit of a trade off. You're enhancing your visual memory, but you're sacrificing some\nof the other sensory memories of the smell, and the vibe\nand the emotional experience of being there.\n(soft upbeat music) There is local music being played, there's a smell of summer in the air. There is just a vibe of excitement and relaxation that you can't capture with a camera. (soft upbeat music) It's amazing light, I just wanna take a bunch of pictures. And so, that's what we do at first. We take a bunch of pictures. But then comes the most important part. After you've taken a bunch of pictures, gotten it out of your\nsystem, put your camera away and let your brain do the documenting. (soft upbeat music continues) You have that visual\ninformation saved in photos. Now it's time for your brain to capture the other sensory information, the smell, the breeze, the sounds, all of that experience that\nyou can't get with a camera. The photos you took will\nbe put under a computer. I'll delete probably 80 or 90% of 'em, keep just 17\npictures from that night of the hundreds I took and\nthose photographs will serve as a link, a gateway to that memory. And it will hopefully spark in my brain, all of that\nother sensory information that I experienced that night. (camera shuttering) Okay, so now, it's time for\nwhat I say is the payoff of all of this. If you are intentional in your efforts to cool down and delete photos, and to be in moments\nwhen you're in moments, and to let those sink into your brain and to capture them as well, if you do all of that intentional labor, now you are in the amazing\nposition to be able to what I call, explore your memory. (bright upbeat music) To go back and to spark those moments and those feelings again. So, you can do this several ways, you can do this a million ways. But the way I choose to do it\nis to go into Apple Photos, where I have all of my\nphotos in one catalog and to zoom out. You can zoom out to years, which is basically, you\ncan see an entire map of all of your photos year by year. Pick a year. 2015, we went driving in Florida\nto look at some manatees. Again, I'd totally forgotten\nabout this experience until right now. Here we are, we go in, saw the manatees and then we drove back. And I remember our car broke down. We were on the side of the road for a bunch of hours\nwaiting for a tow truck. And there we are. And I took a bunch of photos that night, just because I had nothing\nto do and the light was pretty cool. I probably had a couple 100 photos, just because I was bored, but I only kept four\nphotos of the breakdown. And that's enough for me. That image right there of the\nvan broken down on the side of the road is enough to\nspark that entire memory, because it's so vivid and it captures so much of that moment. That shot mixed with Iz\nsitting there reading a book by the light of her phone in her swimsuit is enough to spark that memory for me, and to help me relive it, and to feel all those feelings again. So that is effectively\nthe general approach to how I think about documenting my life. It maybe seem simple, take\nphotos and organize them. But there's some foundational concepts in there that I think people miss out on that make a huge difference. So to review, find a good photo software that syncs your photos to the internet and to your devices, so you have a backup and you\nhave them easily accessible on both devices. This will lead you to deleting your photos,\ndeleting, deleting. Delete most of the photos you take. Only keep the ones that spark a memory or spark joy for you. When you go on trips or you're in places that you really want to remember, have some camera free time. Put the camera away and try to document the experience with your brain only. This, paired with\nintentional photographing of that place, will later lead\nto more immersive memories and a better way to\nrelive those experiences in a way that isn't just visual,\nbut is sensory generally. And finally, the payoff. Don't forget if you do all those other steps to then explore your\nmemories, spend time going through those old photos and remembering why you kept them, trying to relive those experiences\nthat you want to relive. And this also helps you\ncome to terms with the fact that everything is temporary and it passes away, and changes, and that things that seem\nlike a really big deal, that are stressful now,\nprobably won't be stressful in 2 1/2 years when you're scrolling through the photos from today.

    "captions": "- [Man] This space. (light electronica music) How could we possibly make this space the perfect office and studio? Well, it requires a lot\nof trips to Home Depot. Where I first bought\nthese big yellow tools, that presumably were exactly what I needed to start doing this. (light electronica music) Quickly, the space devolved into chaos. It hit rock bottom on the day when there was\njust a giant pile of cabinets appliances, drywall, and\nheaven knows what else, all stacked right here in the\nmiddle of this front room. It's moments like these when you wonder if this is\nall ever gonna come together, but then the building starts. More Home Depot and shipments. So many shipments, so many boxes. There's hard wood floor. There's weird electrical\nproblems that come up and suddenly you're\npaying your electrician way more than you hoped\nyou'd be paying him. - I see. - But slowly it starts to come together. It starts to look like the kind of space\nthat you want to be in, work in, create in, but there's still a long way to go. Next comes the visit to a rug warehouse where a man who came from\nAfghanistan 30 years ago shows you a million rugs and you decide how\nyou'll cover your floors. And will these rugs actually dampen the acoustics of the room,\nso we can get good audio. I sure hope so. Before you know it, the owner has forcibly\ninvited you to his restaurant that's just right next door. Where he gives you piles of steaming kebab and rice and chickpeas and tea and beautifully fresh bread. Henry, do you love this food? Back to work. Your child is now sitting on the floor. Wait, is that asbestos tile? It probably is. I should probably get him out of here. Scan the internet for the right tile, back to Home Depot. The boys are in their\nPJ's because it's bedtime. But for some reason we\nhave to go to Home Depot. I don't really remember what happens next. I just know that after a\nmillion trips to Home Depot and a million passes on this place, a million tiny details, it's done. This is what the place looked like when we bought it in December. And now, it looks like this. (heavy bass electronica music) We wanted a space that didn't feel too much like a proper studio, but rather a place you would\nlive in, spend time in. And while I had some of the vision for how it would be remodeled and what kind of\ncountertops it would have. Iz was the one with the\ninterior design vision. She put a giant effort into collecting a set\nof textures and designs that felt that once natural to us, but also interesting and like a statement. The space has all sorts of textures that means something to us, like this Pendleton blanket that comes from our home state of Oregon or this pillow that we picked up in a\nmarket in Wahaca, Mexico when we were there in December. This beautiful tan couch was sent to us by Article, an online couch company that has also sent us these\nstools and this table. All of this providing a unified texture that feels so natural to\nthe space, it feels artful and yet comfortable. And all these textures a top, these Afghan rugs that we\ngot from that warehouse. (heavy electronica music) All the gear people who are like, hey, we came here to learn\nabout your gear storage and your studio workflow. I will get to that. I promise, but just take\na minute to just revel in the beauty of this room. Okay, so for all the gear people out there here's something you're gonna like. See these bars up here on the ceiling. This is a track with a hanging arm that allows us to mount\nwhatever we need to, microphones, light, a top-down camera. It can all be mounted right here with the flexibility\nto slide back and forth along this front room. This front room is kind of\nour primary shooting space. We can shoot here the couch or if we need to get\nmore of a studio look, we can pull down the seamless's, which give us a variety of\ndifferent colors to work with. Moving over to the kitchen, this is where you see my pride and joy. This giant slab of Walnut butcher block. I worked really hard to get this sucker. It came from a woodworking\nshop in Illinois. And when it got here, it was\njust a raw piece of wood. And I spent a lot of hours beveling it and sanding it and oiling it. And it's safe to say that I now have a very special\nbond with this piece of wood. The kitchen serves a similar purpose. It allows us to film here, but it's a totally functional\nkitchen with snacks. And most importantly, a nice coffee setup. (funky electronica music) We use this new setup from\nFellow, it's the stag system. And I really liked it so far. (funky electronica music) Irving Farms, a roastery\nand cafe in New York City sent us this beautiful\ncoffee and we love it. It tastes different than any other bags we've\never had in the house. And I'm just really glad it exists. Okay, so beside the kitchen\nwe have this audio table, where we have two mics\nthat are always setup, they're USB mics, and we can\nrecord voiceovers or podcasts. It's also a place where\npresumably we could have a meal. And if we ever have guests who want to work out of the space, this would be their place. Okay, so now into the office area, but first you probably noticed\nall these framed photos that we have around the space. These were given to us by a\ncompany called Frame Bridge. And I have to say, this has\nbeen one of my favorite parts of this whole experience. We take a lot of pictures and usually only see them on\ncomputer or phone screens. So to see them in these giant\nframes all around the space, it's been incredibly gratifying. It's like art with a memory baked into it. Okay, now onto the office. Remember now it used to look like this with new paint and floors\nand bunch of decor. It now looks like this. (funky electronica music) The anchor to a good workspace is a good desk and chair setup. And for this, we are so, so, so grateful that we found a company called Fully. Fully is based out of our\nhome, Portland Oregon. And we just have fallen\nin love with these desks. They make these sit stand\ndesks that are totally solid. We have the bamboo Jarvis\ndesk with this subtle cutout. And I have to say, I'm in love. They have loads of accessories like this laptop and monitor arm, or this magnetic hook,\nthese file cabinets. Along with the desks, they send us these chairs\nand they look kind of funky. But the whole point of these chairs is that they get you moving\nthroughout the day. You can sit in a bunch\nof different positions which I've found to be really\ngood for my very fidgety self. These desks and chairs\nhave changed my world. They've made my work day a\ntotally different experience. So by the way, I'm gonna\nplan to make a video entirely about my working setup and hacks that I use for\na more efficient day. But let's move on to\nthe rest of the space. Iz intentionally gave me\nthis entire wall to myself and I'm very, very happy about it. And to populate it, of course, I chose my favorite\nthing in the world maps. I found this old map on eBay that was in like an elementary\nschool and it's been lovely. I find myself just staring\nat it during the day. You'll also see more of\nthese Frame Bridge frames and some miscellaneous photos from Switzerland and other travels. I'm gonna keep adding to this\ngallery and changing it up. Okay, let's talk about gear, finally gear. Everyone's here to talk\nabout gear I'm sure. I love pegboards. I got these cheap pegboards at Home Depot and spray\npainted them black. And this allowed us to take\nall of the gear and accessories and camera stuff out from under our bed and our children's closet and in every crevice of\nour house and put it here. It took a long time to\ndevelop a coherent system to get everything organized\nand up on this wall. But the payoff has been huge. Over here, we have this closet with a charging station\nthat is firm and permanent. It's the first time that I've ever had any sort of solid,\npermanent charging station. And it's been a dream come true. SD cards, tripods, they all have a place\nand they're not competing with four people living in\n700 square feet any longer. Iz of course has her desk and her wall, which is full of gorgeous\nplants and knick-knacks. Many of them coming from our travels. (light electronica music) So that's our studio. It's been a big investment\nof time and money for us. But after years of recording voiceovers\nunder blankets in my bedroom and stuffing camera gear\ninto our children's closets, we're finally investing in a\nspace that spurs creativity and gives us room to make more stuff with the least amount\nof friction possible. We're excited about this place and what it means for our future. And you'll be seeing it\na lot more in our videos. (bells ringing music) I just wanna clarify one\nthing really quickly. In this video, I talk a lot\nabout the products that we use. Some of this stuff was\nsent to us for free. I want to be clear that all of these items are\nthings that we actually use. And none of the brands that sent us stuff paid us or told us what to say. They had no control editorially over what we said about their product. For the stuff that I bought personally, I will leave an Amazon link for. I made sure that all of the\nbrands that sent us stuff, we get no kickbacks if you\ndecide to go buy a Fully desk or an Article couch or\nsomething from Frame Bridge. I wanted to make sure that\nthere was a separation from their influence in\nhow we talked about them. Plus stuff that I bought\nfor myself on Amazon, that stuff does support Izzy's channel. She has an affiliates account with Amazon. It's important that I clarify this because I want you to know that everything I talked\nabout here was 100% based on my own evaluation and critique\nand usage of these items. So thanks for watching. And let me know if you have\nany questions about the space. (light electronica music)"

    "video_id": "OAcXVIK9mjo",
    "captions": "this photo it's a town in Austria super old like people have been mining the saltier since thousands of years BC the town sits here nestled in the Austrian Alps the lake the surroundings it's also beautiful maybe you've seen this town in a picture before I know I have like a million times seriously I've seen this photo so many times it's the screensaver on my in-laws Apple TV I see it in travel magazines and no matter the weather I see it on Instagram it's everywhere this town this photo rather has become a cliche to me every photo taken from the same place from the same angle this place is not a place to me it's just a symbol a single dimensional caricature seared into my brain through so many exposures to this one angle maybe this isn't the case for you maybe you've never seen this photo before but if you like to travel like I do certainly you have places like this the spots you always see in photos as you scroll the places that if you travel to you would just have to take that one photo from that one angle that same angle repeated a million times by a million visitors so I went to this town why not sure really maybe just because it's beautiful maybe I wanted this classic photo for myself regardless of the motive as I drove closer to this place I couldn't quiet this burning curiosity what is this place outside of being an Instagram cliche is it really a quiet village in the Alps as the photo promises no it's not this place is called hallstatt it's an idyllic village that was once known for salt mining but now the town lives on only one economy and it's the economy of people who come here to take this photo buses of tourists show up here to bustle through the Main Street on their way to this spot where they can cram in and take this picture I think is said it best it's so darling so crowded so darling so crowded so darling Oh why do you even travel in the first place what makes you spend your money to leave your familiar surroundings sit on an airplane and trek into unknown places more and more people travel for this to seek out these iconic places where they can show that they too are part of the club but for me travelling for this would be like buying a beautiful Persian rug and then covering most of it with a paint cloth the part left uncover is beautiful but it's just a tiny piece of the whole thing it's just on the edge what if you did things differently if you decided to break away from the tour buses and go in any direction from this town you'll certainly find a quiet road near a mountain that no one's ever heard of and then you'll walk through a quiet forest that no one's ever talked about on the Internet [Music] you'll stay in a cabin far away from any top destinations list and it'll be quiet [Music] you'll drive and drive and you'll go to towns that you didn't plan on going to and see beautiful things you didn't expect to see stuff you've never seen while scrolling online [Music] you'll stop in towns that aren't this one and you'll eat lunch at a place that is frequented by people who live in that town the restaurant and the food that it serves may not make the best social content but it'll be quiet more closely connected to this place these people you'll probably have a better conversation here than in a place where you're fighting with other tourists for a table [Music] you'll take weird turns and go on adventures not really knowing which way to turn because there's no guidebook for this part you'll wander and discover places that have been forgotten where no one's pointing a camera lens and it'll be a buzz a delight you cannot die [Music] not this kind of buzz a different kind of buzz there's always a quiet road somewhere that needs exploring why not break away and go explore it now there's certainly nothing wrong with taking this picture do it edit it up get those photos on the internet tell your friends that you did it you stood in this place studies show that you get a nice hit of happy Chemical to your brain when you do it but when I'm driving on that quiet road puzzling over the mysteries of this place their people their language the mountains the rivers the trees that is what feeds me in the end I'm grateful this town exists it's beautiful its history is beautiful but this isn't the whole package and in fact I'm certain that the best parts of a place life far away from here on your own quiet road waiting to be explored [Music] I want to be clear about something which is that I'm not trying to judge anyone here this is not me trying to condemn if someone enjoys traveling a certain way I made this video because I wanted to have a little bit of a reflection for myself on why I travel and how these iconic places fit into that and this is the result so no judgement enjoy your time and your travel however you want to your life also I want to say it the music in this video which I love was produced by Tom Fox he's a guy who's been making music for me he's super good and he's he does the cynthy stuff he does all this amazing work I'm gonna leave his link in the description should go check him out thank you for watching lots

set that allows me to do what I do today and I want to break down why and how it effects my work and why it's so important that I have these soft skills in my skill set so what do I mean by soft skills makes them sound like they're not that great maybe we should come up with a new term that isn't hard and soft skills I put into this video I'm gonna come up with some new term for hard and soft skills so stay tuned for that I should talk it through first soft skills you're - for known as soft skills soon to be changed and something else in my mind our skills that you learn that are not prescribed in a manual there's no tutorial for soft skills they are thinking skills they're how to ask the right questions how to inquire into society's biggest questions their skills that that allow you to critically think about the world and to understand the world in a better way hard skills are kind of the opposite they are skills that allow you to execute things like programming or graphic design these aren't skills that necessarily help you understand the world but you are able to execute things and build things and they're technical they require an understanding of a technical language that is used to execute a deliverable or a thing okay so soft skills are more thinking academic skills hard skills are more technical executable building stuff skills nyan ever since we did that Hong Kong story on neon lights for borders I just have this new appreciation for neon and what's it that's a better term for this stuff soft skills if you want to tell stories about the world and you want to convey information in any form whether it's explainer stuff or narrative or journalism or whatever it is you have to have a broad foundation of soft skills of critical thinking skills you have to you don't have to go to school always for those but if there's anything school as good at in my opinion it's not the hard skills it's not the technical stuff to me that's the stuff you can learn on your own to me what college is good for is the soft skills is the critical thinking that's the thing that like the professors and the academics of like figured out how to teach and figure out how to convey so I'm done talking in abstract concepts here I'll tell you how it worked for me as I've said before I switch to international relations after a semester of I've been disillusioned with the film program and I immediately discovered a world of discussion and debate and inquiry there's no right answer in international relations there is a an ongoing debate the academics call it a discourse which is a very wonky academic word there is an ongoing discourse about the world how the world works how society works what's the best policy to help the world work better and for people to be more peaceful and no one agrees and that's great in fact that's like what soft skills are all about is that no one agrees on this stuff but there's a bunch of people out there inquiring and that's another wonky term inquiry inquiry inquiring what they're doing what that basically means is they're asking questions why is it when you cut taxes on this certain thing all of these other things happen as a response [Music] and they study it and have these methods that they dig into to study it and that is inquiry and then they write up a paper and they submit it to a journal and then all their peers professors from different universities read this article and now it's a part of the discourse now it's a contribution to this ongoing discussion about how the world works that is the process of at least the social science that I studied international relations political science and even economic [Music] my mind started to change how I saw the world I didn't see the world as some sort of I'm looking for the right answer I started to see everything as a as an exercise of inquiry what can I ask about the world that's interesting and then how would I go about finding the answer what evidence could I find that would help me understand this thing better you do that for four years and you become a much more nuanced and powerful finger suddenly you're able to access the discourse you're able to say oh I'm interested in tax policy and zoning law in Hong Kong instead of like trying to find the Wikipedia article I'm gonna literally find the person who studies this and read their academic research important caveat to all of this I'm not a school person formal education was always very difficult for me I'm diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD to neurochemical things that make it really hard for me to jump through the typical hoops of reading a bunch of text books and taking a multiple-choice test and all the kind of those formal things that we do in college and in school generally I just kind of sucked at all ways and so I struggled in even in college I struggled even when I was feeling empowered by this information of inquiry I still struggled to perform and ended up not doing super great in college but to me the textbooks and the kind of memorizing facts that's not what you're supposed to learn in college like that's not what is useful about going to an institution with a bunch of smart professors what's useful about that experience is learning how to think differently you can learn the facts by reading a book or going onto Wikipedia like and the college environment is an environment of debate and inquiry and so you're constantly surrounded with these debates do you learn to think differently to me this skill is so important for the work that I do my job is to go out and to ask big questions about big international issues and I will say that my education primed me to be able to do that tipple are probably able to develop those skills on their own in the same way that you can develop video skills on your own but to me it's a lot harder it's hard to find a replacement for the setting when you're sitting around with your peers debating and discussing and you have a professor who's really smart who's leading the discussion who is helping push your ideas past where they currently are that to me is a unique academic experience that College provides so the big takeaway from all this and the thing that I think is really important to mention is that soft skills are important arts feels important together they are incredibly powerful and that's what I've built a career off of is blending these soft skills with hard skills it's a really powerful combination to have a social science mix with a hard skill and I don't think this is gonna change anytime soon I think hard skills are gonna become increasingly more valuable and if you hedge by learning some hard skills in addition to your soft skills you'll be in good shape I hope this was helpful snow on my lens hope this was helpful in some way having some basis of my perspective on college and hard skills and soft skills and the combination of those skills I didn't come up with a cool alternative vernacular for hard skills and soft skills I wish I would have come with a different term if you have like an idea of like what's a better term to describe these two different buckets of skills that's better and more descriptive than hard skill and soft skill I'd love to hear it all right I'm gonna explore this city as it wakes up still very early and snowy and I will see you next time [Music]"

    "title": "The 5 Things I Do When I Get to a New City",
    "video_id": "Aj4xV7XHGjg",
    "captions": "five things Coffee Park bakery viewpoint and water I'm in Oslo and I'm tired it's [Music] 4:00 in the morning in DC right now I haven't slept my body is begging me to just go to sleep right now but I know from experience that that never ends well I promise it never ends well over the years of dealing with jet lag there are five things that I find are a great way to curb the jet lag and see the city all in one so let's get started wait actually no I have to get a haircut first because I'm just I'm feeling a little and I'm speaking at City Hall tonight in Oslo where they give up a Nobel Peace Prize like that same venue and I can look like this weird haircut but that's not one of the five things that's just that's just my thing don't show up to new city and get a haircut okay I don't care the training yes yeah [Music] where they give up a Nobel Peace Prize like that same venue the trainee did a great job and I got 50% off my haircut okay let's get to these five things first a latte please right here that was a wonderful latte thank you so much yes have a great day bye-bye yes nothing better than a quality latte all day oh and fun fact I guess I can't help myself Norway drinks more coffee than any other country in the world per capita next up is water not every city has a waterfront but most cities do there's usually a river and along that river there is usually a nice walk it's a good way to get your bearings because a river or a body of water doesn't have any buildings and so you kind of see a more wide open area and water don't just energizes me it's that weird yeah that's kind of weird the water energizes me like looking at water energizes me the best antidote to jet lag is not caffeine its movement look at that shadow isn't sunset no it's literally noon it's 12:30 1:00 it is noon but the Sun is in eternal Twilight mode here in the northern part of our planet during the winter the Sun doesn't really ever go above there just kind of that's High Noon which is amazing if you're a photographer look at how long that shadow is so next up the bakery by a bakery only because it's a bakery it's like a institution in every country in the world the bakery is where on display you can see what the local to bear is with the foundational steeple of a places construction there's a guy over here using a jackhammer if this were my country the jackhammer would be 800 times louder but instead in true Norwegian fashion it's an electric-powered one and that's much quieter probably more efficient probably better for the environment man I love it here sweet bread he's still here it's an egg-based yeah I'll try that is it oh it's coconut on top cool yeah let's do that it's like oh you get out of here just pigeon fest I have some very predatory pigeons so yet bread it's like carbs it's like comfort it's all these things that you kind of need on a jet lag day and it's the sweet thing that I've never seen before this is some sort of egg tart with coconut on it they said it was very Norwegian okay hmm whoa yeah a licorice in there maybe some cardamom dude I'm into that it's like a sweet bagel with creamy egg goodness on the inside next up let's go find a viewpoint the reason I like the viewpoints is because it usually entails a little bit of a hike which is good for moving the blood getting your legs worn out and like the waterfront it is a good way to get context of the city you've just landed in you don't have to hit the most special viewpoint in the city just hit a viewpoint something that gives you context of where you are and something that entails a little bit of a hike like this hill here we go [Music] and I think I'm gonna get a pretty cool view I mean look at this intense wall I'm feeling invigorated man that's the other thing about this whole thing like you go around searching for all of these things and it's like it turns into a little scavenger hunt I'm getting to the top here shadows you guys are like I don't care about your shadow like stop talking about the light I often get comments when I'm in places with non photographers they're like dude why do you keep talking about the light like it's just licensed the Sun and I'm like nose looks so nice right now and they're like you're not even photographing anything and I'm like I know but it's like so nice so I'll just stop talking about my shadow go find a park I don't try to pack any of like the coolest or best things in on that first day because you're just not gonna enjoy it as much and so just like take the pressure off your expectations are probably really high already and just like go on your little scavenger hunt why a park well again a part gives you an opportunity to move to walk around to explore I also find a part like the beating heart of a lot of cities it's fun to walk around a park and just see what's going on are there local musicians like what cultural expressions are happening in the park what's the natural beauty in the park there's a nice big Central Park here in Oslo but it's now the holiday season and so the park has been turned into a fair of sorts adds extra bonus because now it's just full of Christmas cheer [Music] there you have it or five things I'm feeling really good coffee park bakery viewpoint water if you make the effort to do these five things or something like them on your first day take the pressure off and do the big touristy things you will not regret it you'll sleep better you'll act the maid and you'll get to know the city a little bit better oh and you can get a haircut if you really want to just make sure to ask for the trainee [Music]"

    "title": "How I Got My Job at Vox | Lessons About Getting a Job in Video",
    "video_id": "hzwfWzGmCnw",
    "captions": "so everyone asks me how I got my job at Vox I'll warn you now if you're interested in this look at how long this video is it's not a two-minute video this is not a short answer I am going to tell the story of how this all worked out for me and maybe you can glean some lessons for yourself I am in Utah and I am very happy to be in Utah I have snuck away into the mountains for a moment because that's what you do when you're in Utah I have about 20 minutes right now before I'm meeting up with a friend who I only know from the internet but he's another filmmaker named Brad and we're gonna hang out and fly drones so I recently talked about how I got started making videos and you haven't seen that I'm gonna link it here it's the first part of this story where I left off there was basically I was this kid who tinkered around with my parents camcorder for years the film major for a hot second and then dropped out because I was disillusioned with the program but kept making stuff I married a girl who also like to make stuff and that's how I got started how did I turn that into a professional situation where I was suddenly making stuff for bigger organizations or for a place like Vox and that story begins in April of 2013 are you limping I'm even working out [Music] what are we really doing see so we graduated from college and that same week also is he had a baby that wasn't the most practical decision and then we moved across the country to Washington DC where I didn't have a job lined up we had a baby we had about $1,300 in our bank account and yeah we were feeling really good about life that $1,300 we had in the bank came from a research grant that I got in college to go do field research in Peru so we moved to Washington DC I went to Peru [Music] and at that point I thought I was going to be getting a job in international relations I was like I'm probably gonna be a diplomat or something like that well it turns out that it's really hard to get a job in international relations in Washington DC there are a lot of people who have just graduated who are looking for jobs and there was no way I was gonna find anything better than an internship and so while I was in Peru I came to this conclusion that I really had to leverage my video skills and remember where we're at here my video skills are nothing special like they're a bunch of home movies a little bit of motion graphics that I had done but I was not I did not have a strong portfolio of work or a really developed skill set but what I did have is a big desire to pivot and say I'm gonna go full into video and make a career out of making stuff so while I was in Peru I cobbled together all of the work I possibly could all of the dummy projects all of the stuff that looked at all decent and I put it on to a portfolio website that I built with a basic WordPress template and I started to apply the jobs Wow the top of this hill I put together this pretty weak portfolio everything I possibly could and this was me scraping the bottom of the barrel to say like at least know how to make some stuff this is lesson number one of this store and I didn't realize it then but I realized it now I had my expectations really low I was like man I don't deserve to be making really amazing stuff for really amazing places so I wasn't applying to my dream jobs I was applying to any job that would get my hands on the tools that will allow me to make more stuff and to get better at this stuff that's all I wanted I wanted someone to pay me to just play with After Effects and play with the camera we literally needed money like like I had a brand-new child and as he was recovering from pregnancy so I started working in a restaurant cutting vegetables I've always wanted to work in a restaurant I kind of loved culinary stuff it's an amazing experience and it and it paid the bills so after a month of searching and working restaurant I finally found a job in motion graphics I was going to be making video for not box not the New York Times not National Geographic but for an architecture regulation firm nothing that had anything to do with what I'd studied nothing that I was interested in but the key component here is that they were paying me for 40 hours a week to sit down and to make stuff in after-effects and there I learned a ton I stepped up and started to learn so much about how everything works in these programs and I started to make a lot of stuff and it wasn't stuff I loved and it wasn't stuff that was pushing me creatively but it was stuff I was making stuff got to make so much freaking stuff and I was doing it and I was getting paid for it it's getting close to meeting up with Brad time I should head back down and hopefully I don't slip on this little snow so I worked there for the rest of 2013 and then I saw a job open up at a think-tank and International Affairs think-tank they wanted someone to make videos for them and I was like boom this is my next step like I now know how to make motion graphics and I had done some dummy projects on the side that kind of looked like you know maps and stuff so I applied there to this think-tank CSIs is the name of the think-tank and got the job and again was this my dream job was this what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life no but was this a job that got me one stepping-stone closer to what I did want to be doing in my life I was able to put my hands on the tools for 40 hours a week and I was doing something in had to do with international stuff which was closer to my wheelhouse so suddenly this kid this kid is now slowly starting to round himself out as a professional video person but this is a lot of time in the trenches and this is a lot of intensity when it comes to learning new things and pushing myself during the process but you can start to see the transformation at CSIS I really start to dig into mapping into storytelling into explanation into honing what my kind of voices my writing voice this skill set starts to become more and more refined into something that's professional and not just a hobby okay so now it is early 2014 and voxcom is born I remember the day I saw a box for the first time it's like in April 2014 it was like a healthcare videos in animation and I watched that video and out loud I said to myself in an empty room I will work for these people I will do whatever it takes to work for these people and I knew that didn't mean just like passion and perseverance it meant like I have to get the skills to work for these people so suddenly my work days were not just you know trying to slowly refine it was like how do I refine my skills to be good enough to work at box that became the goal so after a couple of months I applied for a position at box and an animator position came up I applied for it and I got rejected I wasn't good enough at that time I really wasn't I was left distraught and stewing on what on earth I could do to get hired at mode it was exactly four years ago from right now in Thanksgiving break of 2014 that I decided I was going to make a video specifically for Vox that was my pitch on why they should hire me and over that Thanksgiving break I poured my soul into making that video I called it my video resume and it was like the five reasons I would be an asset to your team here take a just a moment to watch a section of this video so you can get a flavor of what I'm talking about here I am a multimedia generalist based in the Washington DC area and my whole thing is that I'm interested in connecting high quality media arts with foreign affairs I pored over this video I remember being in the airport on the way back from Florida where is these parents were living at a time I remember I had to board the flight but I had these like through the 3d section of it I was rendering in cinema 4d and I was like I can't like let this stop rendering cuz I have to finish it like on the plane and so I downloaded this extension called power nap where you can leave your computer on after you close at your laptop and it will continue to run and so I did that like really quick and then I like closed my laptop and let it render the 3d stuff like while I had it in my backpack and it was an obsession it was a literal obsession like I have to do this so I finished the video and I sent it to Joe and Joe responded yes and that started an ongoing conversation that lasted a few months that ended in a job offer at Vox hmm yes I'm gonna give you a couple of takeaways that I think are useful from this story I don't just want it to be a story I want it to also be like maybe some lessons the first takeaway is the exact same as the one I did in the in the previous video which is you don't need a gatekeeper to validate that you are professional I don't have a degree in filmmaking or InDesign or animation or in journalism but I was able to enter into this craft and the skill set and I'm able to do it now you don't need a gatekeeper to validate you the second takeaway is about understanding the long game of developing professional skills the long game perspective here is that you find a job that allows you to get better at the skills that you need to get better at that job probably won't be the ideal perfect job that you want it won't be your dream job but it's gotta be a job that gives you a large body of repetitive work on doing the same thing that you want to be doing in your dream job if you want to get into journalism that could be going to a local paper and writing a ton of stories in and learning how to be edited a traditional editor if you're a filmmaker that might be shooting weddings if you're a designer that may be like designing for your like local like school newspaper something actually did that in college I designed for our political newspaper and learn design skills not because it was my dream job and that's what I wanted to do but because I wanted an opportunity to put my hands on the tools and to get experience and repetition in those tools okay I got to go run to pick up Brad now but the last takeaway here I'm gonna call the prove that you're worth hiring take away what I mean by this is if you really want to work at a place and you really believe that you have this skill set then prove it like prove it like show don't tell I get emails all the time from people who are like I love box box is like my dream it's like so great and I want to work there like III is there a job and I'm thinking you're telling me that you're passionate about box and that therefore you should be hired that's not like proof like a million people are passionate about box if you feel like you should be hired prove it like show me in fact the emails I like the most or when people are like hey check this thing out and it's like a link that the perfect example is my experience with Joe I sent him an email with my application didn't hear anything I sent him a very short probably one line that was like look at this video resume boom I got an interview show don't tell that is like not only a lesson for storytelling but that is a lesson for getting the job that you want develop the skills and then prove that you if I rambled enough I'm gonna get in my car now my hands a little cold here in the shadow of these giant Rocky Mountains I'm gonna go pick up Brad and we are gonna go fly some drones I've got Brad Devine here teaching me the ways of the new drone I've been like it's a good marginally piney bit bigger yeah this is whatever you call your owner I found him on the explore phase I might do that ever since and he still talks me off he's always one of the Mount Fuji recently pose I hope my long story about how it all worked out with Vox is helpful please leave comments let me know if you have follow-up questions I'm happy to get more detail and as always these videos are for me to answer questions that I can't answer in emails and other things so please just tell me your other questions and if I get a lot of them I will make a video about them alright thanks so much have a good day [Music]"

    "video_id": "WosBbOSbzvA",
    "captions": "I'm really embarrassed to show you this [Music] I'm going through old videos and thinking a lot about the early days of how I learned to make a video I thought I would go back and tell you the story of how I got into video and learned and eventually started making documentaries it's more expensive to live in Hong Kong than anywhere in the world I'm in Portland Oregon today for 48 hours for me it all started with a video camera that my parents had when I was in high school I would take this video camera out and make the weirdest most horrendous looking short films you could ever imagine this stuff had no body it had no use it was ugly and story lists and just really weird 2007 but what it did is it started to hone a sense of me looking through a camera pressing record and then going and editing images together and I did it a lot I mean when I was in high school I would film everything I again had no sense of purpose or story or anything but had my hands on a camera [Music] this is still her end Asst and like worthless stuff but like it represents a kid tinkering with a camera and it represents a lot of time behind that camera eventually what happens when you put a lot of time into gamers you start to think of experiments little things you could do to change the big experiment was when I learned how to mask is they take two pieces of video and to cut out one of them and I started doing these weird experiments where I cut myself out and like this one with this water bottle and throwing back and forth did this in like 2005 and it was like my first moment where I was like oh I can composite two pieces of video over each other I went to college and brought my parents video camera with me and continued to make stuff there as well and that was similar it didn't really have a lot of story or structure or purpose but it was still me putting my hands on a camera and shooting stuff and then going in editing and at college I thought maybe I should be a film major so I enrolled in the intro to film class which is the prerequisite for the film program and in that class I was a bit disillusioned by the fact that we were talking about theory and history and critique of film but we weren't actually making anything I remember asking in like the second week like so when are we gonna like make a movie and they're like oh wait you do that in like the fourth year in one class you get to make a movie but I remember just being so disappointed like wait what that's what filming school is so after at one semester of this intro to film class I dropped out and I was like no I'm gonna find something else I kind of had this idea that I needed to grow up and say okay my dreams of being a filmmaker are over and I'm just gonna switch to something more adult that's where international relations came in I had gone on to international trips and kind of caught the bug of travel and I was like I'll do international relations kind of give up the film then I got married to Isabel while I was in college how's it going dude [Music] oh and she was also kind of into video and film internet and so we ended up buying our first camera together man total bummer I actually spent the rest of that day in Portland recording the rest of this and even hung out with my sister who's a self-taught photographer and she chimed in and the footage got deleted or something it was all offline when I went into the project file so I'm gonna finish it up here we left off I went to college started tinkering around with Izzy Izzy and I who you may know is is I call her Izzy very often speak of the devil hey yes yep liking it okay All Right see you soon bye so me and Izzy during college started to nerd out about cameras so solids the housing is just so much more solid and nice compared to our 50 we bought an expensive camera expensive at the time for us and felt the need to like get good at it and so actress started shooting weddings like photographing weddings which in Utah it's a really cheap wedding market and so we were able to like break into it somehow and it was fun and like we just got a lot of time to play with our camera we would do shoots with friends yeah it was a really good time we started filming our lives and just for personal documentation we have all this old footage that we've edited together and that was just another era of using a camera a lot and editing a lot and around that time I also started to see on the internet more motion graphics 2d motion graphics really becoming a thing like infographics that move and I was like I wonder if I can learn this and so I took a tutorial on lynda.com and essentials training for After Effects which is the Adobe program that I used to animate and I loved it I loved it the problem was my stuff was garbage like a legit garbage I mean I take a look at this [Music] just like super bad stuff but it started off this interest rose like I love making these designs move so I started playing around and kind of making gummy projects that I could get some experience making motion graphics so during high school during college I had good amount of experience with playing around truly playing not really doing much professional work in video and later motion graphics how that transitioned into then a professional market and a professional job is a story for another time and I will tell that story in a video that I'm going to call how I got my job at box which is another big question it gets for now I want to focus on this these early days and give you my two big takeaways of why I think this is important to talk about and why I'm showing you all this old like kind of ugly looking footage number one you don't need a gate keeper to validate you in this industry meaning you don't need a film school or a certificate or anyone to say yes you know how to be a videographer or no you don't know how to be a videographer or whatever it is you want to be in this space the skills and the learning of those skills has been so democratized in recent years that if you want to you can become a videographer and the tools exist through both the training and the tools like the camera I'm shooting it out right now it's a Sony rx100 is literally a point-and-shoot and it's tiny but I can make legitimate films on this if I wanted to and it's a thousand bucks so the more important lesson here and the harder one to digest is that these skills only come through putting in a lot of time behind this camera there's no shortcut to that unless you're like some weird prodigy child which does exist but the rest of us we have to put in the time and that time doesn't always have to be serious and you know what professional work for a lot of my life I've been making not serious not even good work but it was time was time that I was putting man in the camera and that counts for something especially if you approach that time that large body of time and work as a time to experiment and play with new things so find ways to force yourself to make stuff and that can be documenting your travels or your family or your day-to-day life and it doesn't have to go to a big audience or doesn't even have to be good okay any other questions you have leave them here in the description and I will get to them in future videos Thanks [Applause] [Music] last thing I'll say before I sign up here is that I am gonna start to send out an email to people with is every month that has four things a Spotify playlist that we're listening to that month a video that is inspiring
