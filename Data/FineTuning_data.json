    "video_id": "9C_LIFePuWM",
    "captions": "this video is to help you put your vacuum chamber together it's actually pretty easy to assemble but if you do some specific things wrong that it might not work correctly so I want to do my own video putting my own vacuum chamber together so you can see exactly how to do it and help you troubleshoot any problems you might come up with so here are all the pieces that come in your vacuum chamber kit you might have received two of these o-rings if you did just know that you only need one of them now the first step in here is to seal your vacuum gauge so in order to do this you need your teflon tape and you need your hose adapter and you need your vacuum gauge so this tape is very fragile it's made of Teflon and it's meant to sell vacuum or gas lines so what you do is you take your vacuum gauge and you need to wrap your teflon tape around the threads here and it's important that you wrap it this way so wrap it in this direction and just wrap it so that it's flat against the threads and we wrapped it this way so that when we thread this on it doesn't unthread it when we turn it so we turn it this way and just tighten it as much as you can get with your hand and then you can use the included wrench here and tighten it the rest of the way so now this should be able to hold a vacuum then once you have your vacuum gauge assemble then you can assemble your tube line so the first step is to take your hose adapter and put an o-ring on it so you just put the o-ring on the threaded end here and then you put it through the hole here so now the hole ring should be between the hose adapter and the lid and the o-ring is what actually creates the vacuum seal and to make sure the o-ring stays tight against there you take this plastic nut that's included and you just tighten it on the bottom and you just need to get it finger tight on the bottom if you do it too much the o-ring will squish out from the sides and it'll create a gap and it won't create a vacuum seal so you may have gotten a wrench in your kit but if you did don't over tighten it because it will actually make the vacuum seal worse it actually works best to just do it finger tight so as soon as you see that all ring to begin to slightly compress on the bottom that means you've gotten it right and now you can assemble your whole hose assembly so you take the long hose and put it on here and then you take your 3-way splitter here plug it in here take another short hose put it here another one on top here you can plug in your vacuum gauge now and then comes your one-way valve so on these there's a little arrow that's kind of hard to see it's engraving in here but this shows the direction of flow so you can find the arrow on there and if you can't find the arrow then just suck or blow through it and you can see which direction the air is going you want the air to go away from your vacuum chamber so you want the arrow pointing this way so you plug it in here and plug another one in another 3-way splitter then you plug in your syringe remember to take the cap off of it and plug it in then your last hose and then your last one-way valve the arrow should be pointing that way again so now that it's fully assembled you can put the lid on your vacuum chamber and as you screw it it's best to hold the lid in place and then turn the jar beneath it that way you don't turn this and loosen your nut and break the vacuum seal right there okay then once your vacuum chamber is fully assembled you can vacuum it out so put one of your experiments in here whether it be the marshmallow the balloon or the shaving foam and then you can vacuum it out and you'll see that it should easily start to go down the pin should start to go down with each pump and as you pump more and more it will get harder and harder to pump and this won't move as much that's because you're moving less and less air out because you're getting a better and better vacuum in the chamber so after a few pumps you should be able to get down to the maximum vacuum you can get with this setup and you'll be able to tell when you're a maximum vacuum because additional pumps won't make the pin go lower and then once you need to let the air back in you can choose any one of these places but you just pull off the tube and let the air back in and the pin should go back to atmospheric pressure and if during this whole setup your vacuum gauge isn't working correctly or you can't seem to get a good seal here you can always just take off this hold you can always just remove this whole connection here and just plug this on and still pull a vacuum in there just as strong as when you have this on you just won't be able to tell what pressure it's at so if for any reason you just can't get this to work you can pull it off and still have a working vacuum chamber like this and if there does seem to be some type of defect with your gauge let us know at our customer service line I hope this video helped you be able to put this together a little bit easier like I said is a pretty easy assembly the main things are the main thing is getting this connection a good seal and this connection a good seal once you can get this o-ring sealed and this seal then your vacuum chamber should work just fine"

    "captions": "okay today I'm going to be showing you how to make your own cloud chamber to detect subatomic radiation particles so how it works is you have rubbing alcohol vapor in here and then I'm going to set it on dry ice and it'll make the bottom layer becomes supersaturated when the supersaturated alcohol vapor gets hit by a radioactive particle you'll see a streak go across it so even though you're not seeing the particle itself you're seeing the path that the particle took and the reason it creates a path is because the particle comes through at very high speeds and it knocks electrons off of the rubbing alcohol and it creates a nucleation site for the super saturated vapor to condense into liquid and so basically it makes a little condensation cloud that you can see and this is really easy to make so basically you can make your own particle detector for just a few dollars let me show you how you make it and all you need to do this is some rubbing alcohol aluminum foil some black paper a sponge and a cup so to do this what you do is you just get your sponge put it in your cup you soak it in your eyes the propyl alcohol and I'm using 99% isopropyl alcohol usually the kind that you get in the store is around 70% but it works better the higher percentage you have so this is almost pure alcohol and then all you do is tape your black paper on the bottom so all this black paper is for is so that you can see the radiation better then you just need some sticky tack stuff that you can put around the edge of the cup and this will just act as the seal and then what we're going to do is we're going to set this on dry ice so dry ice is probably the only thing that you may have a hard time getting but usually a lot of grocery stores have it okay they need to stick your cup over it and get a good seal now we just need to put it on dry ice so you set it on there and then I'm going to shine a flashlight in there and get a different angle and you'll be able to see what I mean so there they go do you see those little paths going through there there goes one look bottom left corner so cool basically what we're seeing here is background radiation so the particles that we're seeing it can be alpha particles beta particles or gamma particles so gamma particles are photons which are light and beta particles are electrons or positrons and then alpha particles are groups of two protons and two neutrons you can also tell what type of particle is hitting the gas chamber for example alpha particles make a straight thick line and beta particles kind of make a curved wispy line most of these particles here are from the natural radon that's in the air and also we receive cosmic background radiation all the time also on average we're being hit with around 15,000 of these particles per second every day of our entire life if you think about that it's quite surprising that we don't have more cancer than we do because all of these are ionizing radiation so if these particles happen to hit one of your DNA molecules it has the potential to cause cancer what's even more amazing is how fast these particles are actually moving so the alpha particles they're moving it around 15 kilometers per second around 5% the speed of light and the beta particles even faster they're moving at around 40% the speed of light so the beta particles that I'm seeing can also come from cosmic rays another source can be my own body here we do have potassium-40 in us and potassium-40 undergoes beta decay so it shoots off beta particles and that's probably some of the radiation that I'm seeing in the cup so I thought this one was really cool so what you see here is two particle paths crossing and you'll see the one that comes later there's a gap where it crosses the first particle path that's because where the alcohol already condensed it couldn't condense any more because the first path already condensed that alcohol and so when the second particle flew past it then it couldn't condense near that area so it looks like a gap in the path though thanks for watching again everybody I hope you liked this video if you're not my subscriber yet remember to hit the subscribe button and hit the bell to be notified when my latest video comes out and you can ask me any questions you have in the comment section and I'll try to get to them and I'll see you next time okay so we're making dry ice witch's brew what do you think Henry I want to crack the little smile oh there you go so there"

    "captions": "so you may have been warned before to not eat apple seeds the reason is because apple seeds contain a small amount of cyanide so ivy and apple seeds my whole life but I've always wondered about it so today I wanted to test if there really is cyanide in apple seeds so I bought a cyanide testing kit online and I wanted to test how much cyanide is really an apple seeds compared to just tap water okay here our apple seeds let's crush them first and then test them and see if how much cyanide I'd get when I drink the apple juice [Music] see this seed squeezing out right there okay open it up [Music] okay I want that uncle see juice okay so that's what I want right there let's see how much cyanide is in this okay so I'm going to squirt some water on this okay then I'm going to suck all this back up best I can okay shall we see if there's any cyanide in our apple seeds so this is my control here we know that this one shouldn't have cyanide in it so it should be white according to this chart here this is the strip colors so this is greater than ten parts per million white down here is less than 0.1 parts per million the loped the highest amount that you should have in your water is 0.2 parts per million so here's my tap water one you can see that it is white so it looks like there's no cyanide in my drinking water which is that's good news huh okay for the moment of truth now Oh immediately turned blue Wow Wow I didn't expect that looks like I've been a ensign in my whole life look at that that's pure blue okay on our test right here that's that is dark blue I'd say that's greater than ten parts per million Wow okay so this test kit it had two methods to test you can look at the strip and then after about 1530 minutes you can also look at the color of the cuvette and you can see it's just dark blue so we know for sure this has more than ten parts per million of cyanide in it I know that around 270 parts per million of hydrogen cyanide is enough to be lethal so this scale only went up to ten parts per million but it's getting on the same order of a lethal dose of hydrogen cyanide so I'm going to reconsider chewing up apple seeds after this I'm actually quite surprised by this I didn't I didn't think it would be so high another thing to consider though that this is actually a very concentrated sample of cyanide from the apple seeds because normally if you chewed up apples and chewed up the seeds with them it would go into your stomach which has a lot bigger volume so it would mix with that volume and you'd have a lot less concentration but this I just had a little tiny bit of water around one milliliter and added it to that and so I concentrated the effect of the cyanide in it so this is worst case scenario looks like worst case scenario could be quite dangerous with apple seeds hey thanks for watching another episode of every kind of scientist if you enjoyed this video remember to hit subscribe and if you have any questions or comments about any of my content feel free to write me a message in the comment section and I'll see you next time"

    "captions": "hey everyone have you ever wondered what color the stars are I mean usually when you look up at the sky the stars just look like little white dots but if you look really closely sometimes you can notice they're not all the same color so let's take our camera out there and I'm going to take some long exposure pictures of the stars and we're gonna see what color the stars really are okay looks like a great night to shoot the stars there's a star that's Vega up there we've got the Big Dipper over here we're gonna shoot let's see what color these stars are okay so here's my long exposure picture of the Big Dipper you can see when you do long exposures it really lights up the sky a lot of light pollution so let's zoom in and see what color these stars really are so in order to see the true color of each star all I did was take my editing software and just click on each star and copy the color and copy that color to a bigger box so here's the Big Dipper again with the color from each star copied into a bigger box next to it so you can see that the stars on the left they're obviously this bluish color the stars on the right are more reddish and then using these colors you can actually predict the temperature by looking at a chart of blackbody radiation color temperatures so the blue stars are the hottest and the red stars are the coolest if you want to be more quantitative about it which I usually do I found this formula where you can take the RGB color from any color scheme and you can apply it to this formula and it will output what temperature whatever light you took a picture of it will calculate the temperature of that so using this formula I applied the RGB values from every star in the Big Dipper and here's what I got so this plot the blue values are the real temperature that I looked up online and then the red values are my predictions so I predicted that Alkaid was around 16,000 degrees Kelvin the hottest star and online is at around 18,000 degrees Kelvin it actually worked surprisingly well for every star in the Big Dipper I could just use the RGB value in that formula and it was really close to the actual temperature of the star that's pretty amazing if you ask me that you can just use the RGB values from a regular picture and you can predict the temperature of the stars thanks for watching I hope you learned a little bit about stars the next time you look up at the stars try to notice all those beautiful colors shining through and we'll see you next time"

    "title": "How To Understand Quantum Superposition",
    "video_id": "hkmoZ8e5Qn0",
    "captions": "okay today I'm going to be talking about superposition so for me superposition didn't really click until I got this type of explanation in order to describe superposition I want to talk about electrons I'm going to pretend that electrons have two specific types of attributes one is called color the other is called hardness so these are actually real attributes but I'm just not calling them by their real names so it's not confusing so I'm just going to call them color and hardness at the end of the video I'll tell you what that real attributes are so all electrons can either be white or black and for their hardness they can either be hard or soft so this has been measured many times over all electrons have these properties they're either white or black and they're either hard or soft so how do you know whether an electron is white or black scientists use an instrument that I'm going to call a color box so if you send an electron into a color box there's two holes that it can come out of don't worry about how the inside of it works just know that these color boxes work very well there's two holes that the electron come out of a white hole or a black hole any electron that comes out of the white hole is a white electron in the electron that comes out of the black hole is a black electron and just the same as the color box we can also make a hardness box where we measure the hardness of the electron there's a soft hole and a hard hole so if the electron comes out of the soft hole it's a soft electron if it comes out of the hard hole it's a hard electron and same thing as the color if you measure soft electrons and send those soft electrons to another hardness box they will still be soft same with the hard electrons so let's say I do an experiment to see if there's a correlation between color and hardness so I take a bunch of hard electrons I know because I just measured them with a hardness box and I send all those electrons through a color box I find that there's no correlation between color and hardness so 50% of the electrons will be white and 50% of the electrons will be black I can do this same experiment a different way by taking a bunch of black electrons and sending them through a hardness box and I find that 50% of them are soft and 50% of them are hard so again I find that there's absolutely no correlation between color and hardness meaning that you can't predict the hardness of electron based on its color okay now here's where it gets interesting so what if we try to measure both the hardness and the color we want to know if an electron is hard and black or white and soft or whatever combination so let's say I send a bunch of electrons through a color box I know that about 50% of them will be white 50% of them will be black then let's say I take those black electrons and then send them through a hardness box we already know that 50% of those will be hard and 50 those will be soft but let's say that I take those then soft electrons and send them back through a color box what would you guess you'd guess that they're still black right so using real numbers instead of percentages if I were to put in 800 electrons I would expect to get very close to 200 electrons out of the last color box on the black hole but when we actually do the experiment that's not what happens we only get a hundred electrons out of the last black hole and the other hundred electrons come out of the white hole so that means that those black electrons actually change to white electrons so what's happening here is not that we're finding something wrong with our color box because when we go back and use that same color box we find that it's working properly what this is getting at is the fundamental principle called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and basically with this experiment it's showing that we cannot measure both the hardness and the color of an electron not only can we not measure it but it actually doesn't even mean anything to say that electron is both white and hard or black and soft you simply can't state that it has both a hardness and a color so we learned that as soon as we measure the color of an electron it's 50/50 whether that electron is going to be hard or soft and then as soon as you measure the hardness of an electron it's 50/50 whether that electron will then be black or white so let's dig into this a little bit deeper we're going to create a two path device what this is is let's say we make a hardness box that changes the path of the hard electrons so that they join the path of the soft electrons now these mirrors they don't do anything to the electron besides change the path of the electron so let's say I repeat the experiment again except this time I'll replace the normal hardness box with this two paths device hardness box so the hard electrons combine again in the path of the soft electrons so before we do the experiment based on our previous experiments let's try to guess what we think would happen so let's say we put in 800 electrons so that means around 400 of them would be black electrons and then we send those black electrons through our to path device but our to path device combines the paths so that we end up sending all of those 400 electrons through the last color box of those 400 electrons that went through the last color box we would expect 50% to be white 50% to be black based on our previous experiment so we should end up with around 200 electrons in the last black hole of the color box but when we do the experiment once again we find that we do not get what we are expecting we find that instead of 200 electrons coming out of the black hole of the last color box we got 400 electrons so that means that all of the electrons that went into the last color box where black electrons and zero of them were white and no matter how long we run this experiment we find that we never ever ever get a white electron coming through the last color box so at this point after all our experiments let's ask a simple question at the hardness box which path does an individual electron take path 1 or path 2 well let's go through the scenarios so if it took path 1 then that means it was a hard electron and based on our previous experiments we know that if it's a hard electron its color statistics should be 50/50 but we find that that's not the case likewise if the electron took Path number 2 then it was a soft electron and it's color statistics should be 50/50 but we find that that's not the case either okay so the electrons they didn't take path 1 they didn't take path 2 so the other option is let's say it somehow took both paths we can test this though we can stick a barrier on path 1 or stick a barrier on path 2 and we never get 1/2 of electron hitting the we always get a whole individual electron hitting the barrier so there are never any half electrons that hit the barriers so we can't say that it took both paths okay so the only option left is to say it took neither path but we can test this also let's say we put a barrier at path 1 and Pat 2 so that no electrons can get through and sure enough we find that no electrons come out of the last color box so we blocked all the electrons so it didn't take neither path okay at this point we've exhausted all of our options we're saying that the electrons they don't take path number one they don't take path number two they don't take both paths and they don't take neither path so what or where is the electron when it's going through this hardness box scientists had to come up with a new term to describe this type of movement and they called it superposition so superposition is a way to describe the movement of particles when it has no real-world equivalent and the way you use this term is to say that in this two paths hardness device the electrons are in a superposition of being both hard and soft if you've taken a chemistry class before you may have heard of electron orbitals electron orbitals may have been explained to you as kind of the electron is somewhere in this cloud around the atom and you don't really know where it is it's kind of everywhere all at once and what the teacher was trying to tell you is that the electron exists in a superposition around the nucleus of the atom so there is no real-world position of the electron it's in a superposition and you don't know where the actual electron is unless you measure it what's weird about these experiments is that it's saying that all particles exist in a superposition until they're measured that means when we're not measuring something it doesn't even have a real-world equivalent for its position we don't even know where it is we can't even describe it alright thanks for listening to all of this hard stuff if you're wondering what the color and the hardness represented and represents the spin of the electron and two different axes if you haven't

    "captions": "so memory metal is called nitinol because it's a alloy of nickel and titanium so what's cool about it is that you can twist it in any shape that you want twist it all up and if you just stick it in warm water it shoots right back straight it does it pretty forcefully - I just crumble it up stick it in this warm water it's gonna just pop out straight ready to pasta so this memory metal it's used in heat engines motorless motion like robotics it's even used in orthodontics so like in your braces this is the type of wire that's used so a normal wire like steel or something when you bend it it causes the cubic structure all of the planes of atoms to slip past each other and it doesn't matter whether you stick it in a hot water or not it doesn't do anything but this nickel titanium alloy is really cool because under moderate bending like this the planes don't actually slip past each other they just get stretched out when you give them enough energy they just pop right back Hey so cool so what I want to do today is to see if I crush it with enough pressure that it'll cause the atomic planes to slip past each other and it won't pop back into shape okay let's flatten out this memory metal and see if it regains its shape afterwards okay memory metal crushed by a hydraulic press 3 2 1 should be pretty flat now okay so that looks pretty crinkly there's a lot of faults in it now okay so it got pretty flat and it even made some really good crinkles in it so you can't get with just bending it with your fingers so I want to see if those also pop back straight when I put it back in water okay I'm gonna drop this in the water see what happens hey yeah I don't know but at least go straight I thought maybe the crinkles won't come out I'm gonna heat up my water a little more okay so let's put it back in the water see what happens oh it's unwinding but natalja huh that's surprising so i heated the water up a lot almost boiling it didn't totally get back so that means in these parts where it's not straightening it means that the atomic planes slip past each other and now it's truly deformed so I wonder now if I straighten it back out if it will curl back together huh look at that that's so cool that's so cool so normally with night haul if you heat it up you can get it to form a new shape so you can choose what shape you want it to begin when you heat it up but it looks like also if you apply a lot of pressure to it you can make it form a new shape so notice how before it was straight and wanted to be straight when I heated it up but now since I crushed it and made it curly that when I put it in the hot water now it goes back curly that's so cool so that's just from pressure not from heat so the pressure caused the plane - I did not expect that that's really cool I hope you enjoyed this video remember to Like and subscribe if you haven't yet and you can comment in the comment section and I'll see you next time"

    "captions": "all right today I'm going to be talking about gallium so gallium is a really cool metal so at about room temperature gallium melts so if I held this in my hand long enough it would start melting and become just like mercury but the cool thing about gallium is it's not as heavy of a metal as mercury and so it's not poisonous to you it does turn your fingers a little gray though so it's best to wear gloves especially when it's in the liquid form so gallium is a really cool metal because it's one of the four metals that are known to be a liquid at room temperature the others are cesium rubidium and mercury but what makes it even cooler is that gallium isn't toxic unlike the other three so you can play with it in your hand here I'm wearing gloves just to protect my hands from turning black when I play with the gallium you don't have to wear gloves of you don't want black hands though then you should wear gloves another thing to be careful with with gallium is that gallium diffuses into the lattice structure of most metals and makes them very brittle so if you get gallium on aluminum it will make the aluminum become very brittle it'll even do it for steel too so you have to be careful what you get the gallium on if you don't want to turn your strong metals into something that's brittle what amazes me about gallium is that you can have this liquid in your hand and it's easy to forget that it's actually a metal when it's a liquid in your hand so what I wanted to do and I wanted to test if this would work is to cast a nail from gallium see if I can make a gallium nail and then nail that piece of gallium into a piece of wood see if I can do that and then melt the nail I thought that would be a really cool way to show the awesomeness of gallium to show that it's this metal that's also a liquid at room temp very unique metal so I'm going to make a mold for just using some modeling clay I'm going to press this steel nail into here and see if I can make a little mold for the gallium press it in only do about that long or a little gallium in there okay we'll let that harden and see if that worked okay let's see if our nail worked hey cool it did I didn't think it got all the way down in there look at that that's cool there's my gallium nail okay now I'm going to test if my gallium nail can actually be nailed into a solid piece of wood here so here's my nail made out of pure gallium see if it works kind of shattered when in tho so you can nail a piece of gallium into wood now let's see if we can get it out okay now let's try to just heat up our gallium try to get it out of the wood because it's nailed in there pretty good see if we can melt it with a hairdryer okay amazing one second it's a solid piece next is just liquid pretty awesome yeah gallium it's fun to play with what makes gallium act like this why can it go from a solid to a liquid at room temperature well one of the main reasons is the cubic structure of the atoms in gallium versus other metals like aluminum in aluminum the atoms are arranged in such a way that the atoms are very close to each other and so they can easily bond with each other but in gallium it kinda has a weird structure it's not like that normal lattice structures and metals it's called ortho rhombic and no side of the cube is the same as the other so a does not equals B does not equal C and what this means is that the atoms are pretty far spaced from each other so they can't bond to each other very well so they'd rather just be in the liquid form where they can be closer to each other and they can bond really well so that makes the liquid structure very stable for gallium the result of this is a metal like gallium that has the highest ratio between its boiling point in its melting point its boiling point is 2600 kelvin around eight times higher than its melting point that's higher than any other metal in the periodic table thanks for watching everybody I hope you learn something about gallium from my video if you like this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't yet give me a comment in the comment section and I'll see you next time"

    "captions": "[Music] so there's this bridge in Germany called The magur Water Bridge and it's a really interesting Bridge so what it is is there's a canal that they wanted boats to be able to cross but not go through that Canal they wanted another Canal to go over it and so what they did is they built a bridge above one Canal over the other so one Canal was crossing it and so the question I have for you is when the engineers had to design for the weight of the bridge how many boats did they have to design for cuz boats are pretty heavy they can carry a lot of material you could have 100 ton 1,000 ton bat come by how do you design your Bridge or does it even matter so in order to answer this I built my own Water Bridge and I want to measure if we even need a design for the weight of bolts going across it it's a really interesting question when you you have a water Bridge do you need to design for the weight of the boats that cross it I'm going to answer that question right now okay this is my Water Bridge so in the center here is my bridge here's the water up here you'll notice that at this part there's a cutout section that does not have any support it's completely supported by this scale here so first I'll show you that this scale does indeed work it's down here at around 210 G if I put a weight on it it does indeed increase you can see right there went up to around 275 G so what would happen if we put our weight in a boat crossing the bridge let's see so here Here Comes our boat floating across and let's see if we can see the weight [Music] increase nope doesn't even move so you can see it's right on top of it and it does not increase the weight that this bridge actually has to support this is really cool actually so when you design a water Bridge it doesn't mean matter how many boats go over it it doesn't increase the weight that the bridge actually has to support but if it were a car Bridge or normal Bridges the bridge of course has to support the weight that goes on it so why does this happen why when you place a weight in the water it increases the weight that the bridge has to Bear but if you place that same weight on the bridge it does not increase the weight when it's in a boat in order to answer this we need to learn a little bit about buoyancy he in order to show you what I mean first I want to weigh our weight in our boat and see how much that weighs so we get around 400 0 g okay then I'm going to put our boat in our water and what should happen is it should displace the equivalent weight of water as the boat with this weight so that means it should displace around 410 G of water okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to place our boat with our weight in the water and what should happen is it should displace around 410 G of water which is the weight of the boat so I'm going to try to contain the water as I displace [Music] it I'm doing it slowly so I get all of it that comes out okay that should be all of my water now now I'm going to weigh this water that I displaced I'm going to do it all in one shot here so there's no camera trickery let's pour this water into [Music] here and this should weigh around 410 [Music] G let's see what we got so that is about 400 G pretty darn close that means we lost around 10 G of water stuck to the bottom of the pan and in our glass pan here so now back to our boat experiment where does the displaced water go in our boat experiment the water gets displaced and placed evenly throughout the entire length of your Waterway so across the whole river it raises the amount of water in the river ever so slightly so the only amount of weight that this FS when you place a boat in it is a very minuscule amount of water raising very slightly just a negligible amount so when you build a water Bridge you actually only have to design for the small amount of water that that it needs to hold on top other than that you could put any amount of weight on a boat that could go across it that you want it won't have to bear any load on this bridge below other than the water hey everyone thanks for watching I hope you learned something and enjoyed my video If you enjoyed it remember to like it share it comment it I would love some comments about any science questions you have I want to do a Q&A sometime so I need some questions first in order to do a Q&A so ask me any Science question you have and I'll do my best to answer it thanks bye oh no dang it"

    "title": "Shocked By Homemade 3,000 Volt Taser| High Voltage Science",
    "video_id": "BVUFqI2NsVs",
    "captions": "hey guys today I'm going to show you how to make your own taser from a fly zapper this will be around a 3,000 volt taser generally use them the hip flies out of the air they get trapped in there and it shocks them and see you charge it up like that discharge it pretty good spark so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take out the high voltage generator from this and I'm going to use it to make my own taser fart take out the batteries I've already removed these screws so these are your leads here one side is ground and the other is positive you have two wires here because you have some wire on both sides but you only need one of them okay so I'm just going to cut the wires here I'm going to remove this don't need that anymore and I need to strip these wires down so here I'm going to solder on some extra wire just to make each of the wires more accessible and remember you only need to use one of these blue wires okay cover these with some electrical tape you want to make sure they're covered you don't have to solder these but I just did it to hold them in place but do cover them with electrical tape because if you don't they'll probably short out and touch each other yeah do it and like I said this other blue one you don't need to worry about but these up here put this back together don't forget my button this is the button to charge it there we go okay let's check and see if it works yep 3000 volts right there okay to show you that this is high voltage but low amps I can't measure the voltage on this because the voltage is too high this can't go up to 3000 volts but I can measure the amps going through it I have this on the milliamp setting push my button here I have my lead tipped up Oh actually I don't this up here and now I have them hooked up around 3.8 milliamp Scone through it so that's not a lot that is enough to kill you if it went directly through your heart if it goes through other parts of your body I'll just give you a good jolt so you could touch these and you be fine and give you a good jolt but not kill you but be careful because it probably could still kill you okay now that we have our high voltage generator built we can learn a little bit about electric fields so first if I just have these alligator clips connected notice how close I have to bring them before I get a spark it's not that big of a spark that's because in order for a spark to occur the electric field has to be strong enough so that the dielectric breakdown of air occurs so when you have a curved surface the electric field isn't as intense because every surface is curved so you don't get a buildup of electric field lines around the corners but if you can get some pointy ER surfaces then you can get some buildup of electric field lines so that the dielectric breakdown of air will occur and you'll get a bigger spark but if we use some very pointy objects like these pins here then you can get some good sparks so this is the same voltage each time but you have us stronger electric field because of the pointy surfaces so I've dim the lights here so we can see this a little better what I'm going to try to do is get a pretty steady buildup of plasma around the tips of the pins here so you blowing on the tip of the pin look at that so just so there's charges transferring through the air there that's generating a lot of energy and making a plasma between the tips right there so what a plasma is is the nitrogen and oxygen in the air actually get stripped of their electrons so it suddenly becomes conductive so the electrons transferred directly from one pin to the other before plasma is created the air isn't conductive so not a lot of charges are transferred from one pin to the other so usually a plasma is a very cascading effect so you'll see it kind of build up and then as soon as it becomes conductive all the charges jump jump from one pin to the other so this is the same reason why lightning occurs you can get it so there's a steady plasma if you don't let that buildup occur and you just have a steady transfer right at the boundary of when electrons start getting rip from the nitrogen and oxygen molecules so let's see if we can get that to happen it's trap shot and there's a pretty steady plasma in between now that's not even sparking now there's conductive in between just transferring electrons directly that's a steady plasma arc in between the two there okay another thing you can do with your high voltage generator now I just took out the batteries because I just shocked myself pretty good that really hurt my hand I'm sorry I don't accidentally push this button while I'm messing with these wires as you can hook two nails on the end and make yourself a little taser okay so wrap the wire now here okay and then I'm going to take you down like that hey now you got yourself a Taser so here's the thing if you make one of these be very careful this is a 3000 volt taser will really mess you up okay now I'm going to test it on my arm okay here's my taser oh gosh holy cow that gives you a good jolt I just did on my arm but I'm throw out an apple here so you can kind of see so when you when you - when I touch yourself with it even though the current is really only going from I touch when I touch my arm with it just a little bit the current is really only going from here to here but what it does is it's painful throughout your whole body it triggers a lot of spasms through your whole body a lot of muscle reactions because it causes a lot of your nerves to fire because those ion channels just open up from this small little area I've always wondered with the Taser I mean the currents only going from there to there but it really does hurt all over it feels like your whole body gets shocked so there you go homemade taser I really do want to give a warning with this though this is three thousand volts very powerful if you make one of these be very careful with it I would recommend only experimenting on fruit even though I've shocked myself with it here if you shock somebody with a heart condition it could very well kill them a lot of times cops have mistakenly killed people by tasering them so be very careful if you do make one of these it's actually quite easy to make though just from a fly zapper so hope you learned a little bit I'll see you next time I

    "captions": "so did you know that iron is flammable but have you ever tried to light a piece of iron on fire it doesn't work very well so I'm not crazy here's what I mean normal pieces of steel or iron that you find lying around have a very small surface area to volume ratio so when you try to burn it there's not enough oxygen around in the atmosphere to burn it but if you can increase that surface area to volume ratio then you can get some burning action so watch this this is a piece of steel wool that has a very large surface area to volume ratio so this is steel just like the steel I tried to burn a couple of minutes ago but when I light it on fire you can see it easily burns and turns into iron oxide this is actually one of the main reasons why you see sparks fly off when you grind steel or iron you're knocking off very small chunks of iron that oxidize in the atmosphere and start burning another way that you can get even more intense burning of iron is to increase the amount of oxygen that's flowing around the iron so with my steel wool if I were to flow a lot of oxygen around it I would get really intense heat so I decided to come up with an awesome spark thrower experiment so what I've done here is taken a regular eggbeater and I Jimmy rigged it to the end of my leaf blower and the goal here is to expose the steel wool to a lot of oxygen flowing around it and what better than a leaf blower to blow a bunch of air around it okay so I have still wool in here I'm gonna turn on the air blower blow a lot of oxygen over it and it should start throwing sparks everywhere and not like anything else on fire l40 okay that's number one should I be this close the still gets amazingly hot super fast you can see it amasses into one molten glob at the end around 1,400 degrees Celsius the melting point of Steel Oh spark thrower number three yeah yeah don't even in here okay my wife gave me a great idea she was wondering if I could make a color so I got some potassium hydroxide I'm gonna mix it in with the steel wool and see if we can get some it should be kind of purplish playing if it burns so we'll see okay this is spark grower with be careful no purple negative on the purple that's wonderful can I eat it through the earth hey everyone thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe and feel free to ask me any science questions that you have in the comments below and I'll try to get to them thanks see you next time"

    "captions": "hi everyone today I want to talk about air did you know that air is heavy if you were to take a one inch square column all the way up through the atmosphere and weigh it it would weigh about fourteen pounds so why don't you feel this amazing pressure on you all the time the reason is because you have the same pressure inside of you as you have outside of you and so you don't feel the pressure but what if you were to remove that inside pressure then what would happen let's take a look and see one way to use the atmosphere to crush things is to remove the air inside and replace it with water in the vapor form so I've added a little water to the can the goal here is to heat the water up and get it boiling so that the entire volume of the can gets filled with water vapor so what you want to do is heat it up till you see a lot of steam coming out as soon as I see some steam coming out I'm gonna grab it and I'm gonna quickly turn it over inside of this ice water here and what should happen is the pressure inside should sharply decrease and the pressure outside in the air will crush it okay now I'm gonna turn it over in the water you ready whoa you see that that was the weight of the atmosphere on every square inch of it just crushing it as soon as the pressure decreased okay so that was pretty amazing that can just got crushed but I know what you're thinking it's just a little tin can you can easily crush that so what if we up the ante a little bit and crush something a lot bigger than that in order to go big I collaborated with April and Davey from their famous YouTube vlog channel go check them out April and Davey so what they did is they heat it up a 55-gallon steel drum just like we did here let's take a look and see what happened where no no no it took a while ducking again with the longer one what the piece of artwork using the surface area of the steel drum you can calculate the force that the atmosphere puts on the sides of the steel drum I calculate it to be around thirty four thousand pounds of force that's amazing you see that steel drum just crushed like a tin can I'd like to give a big shout out and say thanks to Davey and April for doing that that was a lot of work and a little scary to do thanks for doing that it was awesome thanks for watching everybody if you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you next time"

    "captions": "so what would happen if the Sun suddenly turned into a black hole with the earth just go flying off into space would it get sucked into the black hole today I'm going to answer that question for you but to do that we have to learn a little bit about gravity first the first thing to remember is that everything has gravity the earth and you have gravity you pull on the earth with the same force that it pulls on you except you don't move the earth much because it's so big it moves you a lot though there's gravity everywhere it's a force that permeates the entire universe it's the most unique force in the universe it only attracts never repels that being said though you may be asking well then how our astronauts weightless in space in order to answer this let's turn to NASA nASA has a cool little game on their website that lets you shoot a cannon ball in space let's say that you had a large cannon that you could shoot a really fast cannonball so first you shoot it around 10,000 miles an hour it's really fast and it'll eventually fall to the earth but then let's say you shooter around 12,000 miles an hour it'll go further but it'll still fall to the earth but if you shoot it just right at around 18,000 miles an hour it'll fall but it'll just keep falling and keep falling and keep falling around the earth because it's moving just as fast as the earth is curving away from it this is called an orbit and then if you shoot it too fast it'll just fly off into space early on when the solar system was formed the earth was moving just at the right speed that it was falling around the this is due to the gravity pull of the Sun on the earth so if the Sun were to suddenly become a black hole it would still have the same mass because the mass doesn't change if it becomes a black hole so it would still have the same amount of gravity so the earth would just continue to orbit around the black hole as if nothing happened sure everything on earth would freeze to death and everybody would die but the earth would continue on its normal path a good example of this is our Milky Way galaxy at the center of our Milky Way galaxy is a giant massive black hole that all the stars are orbiting around we're not being sucked into the black hole we're just orbiting around it but in the end we know because of the size of our Sun that it will likely end in a supernova and not a black hole so remember black holes don't suck hey thanks for watching I'll put a link to that NASA website so you can go shoot a space cannon also and remember to subscribe if you haven't yet"

q-tip - next dirtiest is the toilet let's see a bunch they're surprisingly clean still as the skin my armpit and bellybutton aside from those three there isn't much growth so let's look at it after one more day okay so we're at 48 hours now a lot of stuff growing so I'm needing to do some estimations here the toilet is really growing a lot my mouth is growing a lot the way I'm estimating is I'm counting per strip how many there are and then multiplying it by how many times I did it so we're getting up there so far the cleanest thing that doesn't have any growth at all is my toothbrush and my skin and after one more day we're ready to look at the final results okay this is 72 hours later this is the sink it really stinks this one's been growing actively since a few hours into it next we have the toilet it's really covered now too still not as much as the sink though okay this is the mouth so the mouth has a lot of small colonies but not growing very fast not covering a lot of the plate okay this is the iPhone if you can see in this corner here where my fingers pointing that's a mold colony growing we have some mold on the iPhone the rest look like bacterial colonies okay this is my son's puppy stuffed animal where my fingers pointing into that's a looks like some type of mold growing also but we also have a good amount of colonies on this one the remote started growing some this one's kind of interesting you probably won't be able to tell but that big white one is actually lifted off the surface I'm guessing it's not bacterial probably some type of mold but I don't know what it is you can't tell but it's lifted off the surface I mean it's rising up off the surface a little bit okay here's the doorknob this one's not too bad a big colonies in the middle some small ones not a lot overall the floor has a good amount of colonies on they're not growing very fast though this one is a little surprising this is my skin this is armpit and belly button only a few colonies they're very clean compared to the rest of them okay and the winner is for the cleanest out of all home my toothbrush it hadn't had any colonies up till now I'd there's one colony after 72 hours on the right over there so your toothbrush is the cleanest thing in your house based on my experiment so here are the final results on the left axis we have the number of colonies notice that this is a log scale so each tick mark there it goes from ten to a hundred to a thousand colonies that means that a bar that's twice as high as another bar has ten times as many colony the different colors on the graph represent the different time periods that I measured so blue was at 12 hours red was at 24 hours gray was as 48 hours and yellow was at 72 hours so the final results are on the back in yellow in the end the sink was completely saturated by 72 hours the toilet had 600 colonies the iPhone had 74 the floor had 97 the doorknob had 24 the remote had 42 my mouth had 1,500 my toothbrush had only one my son's puppy stuffed animal had 222 and my skin had only eight so by far the all-time dirtiest of all of these objects is the sink the sink is just covered with bacteria next after that is the toilet the toilet is as expected dirty inside of it but you're seeing actually has more bacteria in it than your toilet does and the all-time winner is the toothbrush my toothbrush had one colony growing it's cleaner than everything that I had measured in my house this is most likely due to the toothpaste that gets put on the toothbrush every night and washes away the bacteria the mouth ended up with a lot of colonies but they didn't grow very quickly so I'm calling the toilet dirtier than the mouth and finally one disclaimer here is that I'm using the term dirty very loosely here this just merit measured bacteria and fungus or mold in general but it doesn't talk about the dangerousness of the bacteria there can be different types of bacteria that are more dangerous and some that don't harm you at all so this is just a pretty good estimate of the number of bacteria but not the kind of bacteria that are in your house okay thanks for watching my video today to help you enjoyed it if you did subscribe to my channel even if you didn't enjoy it subscribe anyways -

    "captions": "oh hey I'm just getting a dose of my daily iron so do we really earn that's what I'm gonna show you right now let's take a look at the back of a cheerio box so here's some honey nut cheerios let's take a look on the back here but I'm gonna show you how you can extract the iron from the food that you eat with a strong neodymium magnet okay so I fill up a bag with Cheerios and then I add some water to the bag and I mix the Cheerios up then once the Cheerios are pretty mixed up I can start to extract the iron from it so if you just move the magnet around the bag you can start to collect the iron you can see even the small cheerio bits begin to collect around the magnet also they start to follow it if you look at the corner of the magnet you can see a small bit of iron begin to form we have a good amount of iron here now let's see it attracts to the magnet pulls the back with it it's amazing how much iron is in there now in order to remove the iron I want to get this chunk of iron out of the bag so I move it to the corner of the bag and make sure I have it all in there then I hold the magnet under it and dump it out dump it upside down and out comes the iron so here is the final product this is the iron about the magnet under it so you can see it so you really do eat iron maybe I should eat this little pile of iron and get 2 days worth of iron you"

    "video_id": "Mu-BL50T-lE",
    "captions": "hey everybody today I'm going to be making a solution called poor man's liquid nitrogen so liquid nitrogen can be hard to get sometimes if you want to freeze stuff very quickly you can make this stuff called poor man's liquid nitrogen and what it is it's a solution that you make by putting dry ice in rubbing alcohol and it makes the rubbing alcohol get very cold it can get to around negative 109 Fahrenheit so poor man's liquid nitrogen is a little more unsafe than liquid nitrogen if you were to stick your hand in a bucket of liquid nitrogen you could put it in and out pretty quickly and it wouldn't really make your hand that cold the reason is because when you stick your hand in the liquid nitrogen nitrogen when it's not in the liquid form is a gas and so it forms a pocket of gas around your hand as soon as your hand heats up the liquid and so it insulates your hand it doesn't make it that cold but if you were to stick your hand into a bucket of this poor man's liquid nitrogen a really cold rubbing alcohol it would freeze your hand it would burn all your skin off so don't stick your hand in this stuff very dangerous so let's freeze some stuff with this poor man's liquid nitrogen I'll show you how to make it okay the first thing you need is some dry ice broken up into small pieces like so then I'm going to pour my dry ice and I'll just have pure co2 in here now now I'm going to add some isopropyl alcohol this is a 70% solution if you have a full hundred percent solution of isopropyl alcohol and it will get a little bit colder than we can get this let's just mix it together so now I'm going to wear gloves so I don't burn my hands I'm going to wear this so the liquid can't soak in through the glove and then I'm going to wear a glove you do not want this to get on your skin or a No okay so now we now have a sludge of rubbing alcohol and water it's about negative 27 degrees Fahrenheit 28 degrees Fahrenheit so it's really how cold it is here's some spinach leaf goes in there get out this is frozen solid there's a spinach leaf again not a broken off in there that just crumbles and I got very cold on my fingers okay I'm going to put a grape in okay it's been a few minutes pull or grip out Oh didn't break can't break the grip they're broke alright I hope you enjoyed this video under the poor man's liquid nitrogen go have some fun with it if you want but be safe wear gloves don't stick your hands in it for a long time to avoid frostbite you"

    "captions": "[Music] today I'm going to be using a very costic solution of potassium hydroxide to dissolve chicken flesh okay so I'm using gloves you don't want to let any of this get on your skin it will cause severe burns [Music] [Music] so I'm going to use around 200 g of potassium hydroxide and about a cup and a half of water and you always add you always add the flakes to the water not the water to the flakes so it's very exothermic you can hear it boiling as I put it in [Music] add a little [Music] more you hear that sound that's the water boiling as I put it in add a little [Music] more [Music] I'm going to wait so it doesn't get too [Music] [Music] hot so I'm doing this I'm wearing hand protection I have Splash goggles on and a splash apron also you don't want to get any of this on [Music] [Music] you I don't know if you can hear that on the camera but every time I pour it in oh that is hot my Fork's hot so this was just room temperature water before let's see what the temperature is [Music] now [Music] yep that is hot 205\u00b0 so that's essentially boiling boiling is 212\u00b0 f so just by pouring in the potassium hydroxide to the water it's now a boiling temperature we're now ready for our piece of [Music] chicken here's our chicken leg okay so what's going to happen here is the potassium hydroxide is essentially going to turn all of the cells and cell walls in the chicken leg into soap pretty much and that's what it would do to your skin too it take all the fats that are lining the cell walls and pretty much make them into salt [Music] molecules [Music] [Music] [Music] n [Music] check it [Music] out so the skin around it is now becoming pretty gel fness um you can smell a weird smell um you can see it's kind of falling off the bone now oh there goes give it a few more [Music] minutes [Music] [Music] so all of the connective tissue just becomes gel it's called saponification it's how they make soap but it's doing it to the chicken flesh it would do it to your arm too if you stuck it in [Music] there [Music] okay let's check on it so the meat portion of it is essentially no more there's just kind of a hollow gelatinous shell it's just the bone you can see the main portion of the meat is just this brownish gel slowly melting [Music] away let's give it a few good [Music] stirs so there was a skin on the outside of this this the skin is what's holding up the best and this was a cooked skin but now it's still just this gelatinous Mass the meat is completely just gel now [Music] okay so I want to show the end product here so this used to be meat it is now this gel pretty much soap like [Music] squishy transparent and it now dissolves in water [Music] interesting [Music] he"

    "captions": "okay hey everybody today I'm going to show you how everything is magnetic so I have my super strong neodymium magnet these magnets will crush your fingers are very strong I have two of them notice how I have this one clear over here so I typically keep them in my kitchen mitts because if they get stuck together I'm not coming apart again so what I'm going to show you today is how everything is magnetic so we all know that yes a magnet can attract another magnet but what you might not have known is that everything is magnetic water-air people would so I'll show you these effects of diamagnetism everything repels a magnet I'll show you that what I have here is a syringe full of water and I have my strong magnet I'm not going to touch the magnet too I'm just going to bring it close and it's getting the water it's going to repel the magnet and get pushed kind of looks like you're touching it not to prove it oh there you go not touching it not touching it so water repels a magnet another thing that repels the magnet is wood so here's an ordinary block of wood I'm going to bring the magnet close to it but not touch it and let's change that angle okay Fiats not touching it pushing it away stop it push it away so how is it doing this so diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect which I won't get into but essentially it's repelling the magnetic field the point is you made the piece of wood move no the point is this okay so magneto on x-men you know he has to have metal and things to be able to manipulate him but in real life if he could manipulate magnetic fields he could manipulate anything because everything is diamagnetic so he could just do whatever you want to manipulate anything no matter what you're made out I guess that's my point well that's a take-home message of today magneto get your axe straight if you're really that strong with magnets you can manipulate anything you want to we've never had that conversation before it seems crazy but it's actually true that an electromagnet has been used to levitate a frog this is a picture of a frog floating levitating in the air using one of the world's strongest electromagnets I'll give a link to the actual video of the frog levitating in the description below"
